Now, though, they must choose between being outflanked by Euroskeptic parties on both the far left and far right, or responding to that threat by creating a supra-national democracy that can satisfy voters’ legitimate concerns.	但现在，他们必须选择是要在极左和极右翼遭到欧洲怀疑论政党的包抄，亦或是成立超国家民主制度来应对上述威胁，并解除选民的合理忧虑。
The 2003 European Convention that produced the ill-fated EU Constitution offers no blueprint for the future.	制定出命运多舛的欧盟宪法的2003年欧洲公约并没有勾画出未来的蓝图。
Its convoluted business was conducted largely out of sight.	其复杂业务的展开过程大体上并不接受公众的监督。
To stem mounting criticism of “Europe,” the EU needs the coup de théâtre of an open debate involving civil society, not just a handful of political representatives.	为遏制愈演愈烈的针对“欧洲”的批评，欧盟不仅需要少数政治代表的参与，还需要民间社团参与开放辩论的突变情节。
Its premise must be that the EU is heading toward dissolution, and that only by becoming more responsive to Europe’s citizens can it reverse the trend.	改革的前提是欧盟正在走向解体，只有更多响应欧洲民众的关切才能逆转欧盟解体的趋势。
	
Wall-to-Wall Wal-Mart?	沃尔玛是否横扫千军？
Do you want to know which video clip will soon be scaring the daylights out of policymakers throughout the world?	你是否知道哪一个录像片马上会令世界各地的决策者大惊失色？
In a scenario that looks uncannily like the spread of a global pandemic, the economist Thomas Holmes has prepared a dynamic map simulation showing the spread of Wal-Mart stores throughout the United States.	经济学家托马斯·赫尔姆斯准备了一个展示沃尔玛商店席卷美国的动画地图模拟片，这一景象令人惊讶，看似就像是一场全球性的传染病。
Starting at the epicenter in Bentonville, Arkansas, where Sam Walton opened his first store in 1962, giant boxy Wal-Mart stores have now multiplied to the point where the average American lives less than seven kilometers from an outlet.	1962年创始之初，山姆·沃顿在美国阿肯色州的本顿维尔老家开设了他的第一家店铺，现在，外表四四方方、巨大无比的沃尔玛商店已经翻倍增长，普通美国人的住家距离其中一家商店不到七公里。
Interestingly, the video shows how the stores spread out like petals of a flower, ever thickening and expanding.	有趣的是，录像片展示的是沃尔玛如何像花束一样扩张，不断变厚和扩大。
Rather than jumping out to the coasts – 80% of all Americans live within 80 kilometers of the Pacific or Atlantic oceans – Wal-Marts have spread organically through an ever-expanding supply chain.	80％的美国人口居住在太平洋或大西洋沿岸，沃尔玛并没有扑向美国的海岸线，而是通过不断扩张的供应链条有机地扩散。
Even though each new store takes away business from Wal-Mart stores established nearby, ever-improving supply efficiencies help maintain the chain’s overall growth.	尽管每一家新店会抢走附近的沃尔玛店的生意，但是不断提高完善的供应效率帮助维持了连锁店的总体增长。
Love them or hate them, what is undeniable is that Wal-Mart is the quintessential example of the costs and benefits of modern globalization.	无论你喜欢还是仇视沃尔玛，无可否认的事实是，沃尔玛本质上是现代全球化成本和效益的范例。
Consumers pay significantly less than at traditional outlets.	与传统商店相比，消费者节省大笔开支。
For example, economists estimate that the food section of Wal-Mart charges 25% less than a typical large supermarket chain.	例如，经济学家们估计，沃尔玛的食品部与典型的大型超市连锁店相比便宜25 ％ 。
The differences in price for many other consumer goods is even larger.	其他许多消费品的价格差异甚至更大。
Consider the following stunning fact: together with a few sister “big box” stores (Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot), Wal-Mart accounts for roughly 50% of America’s much vaunted productivity growth edge over Europe during the last decade.	看一看下面令人惊异的现实：美国大为炫耀过去十年来生产效率增长领先于欧洲，沃尔玛连同几家姊妹“大方盒子”商店，例如Target, Best Buy以及Home Depot一起所占的比重大约为50 ％ 。
Fifty percent!	真是一半！
Similar advances in wholesaling supply chains account for another 25%!	类似的批发供应链增长占据另外的25 ％ ！
The notion that Americans have gotten better at everything while other rich countries have stood still is thus wildly misleading.	因此，其他富国停滞不前之时美国人一枝独秀的观点是大为误导的。
The US productivity miracle and the emergence of Wal-Mart-style retailing are virtually synonymous.	美国生产效率的神话几乎就是沃尔玛式的零售业崛起。
I have nothing against big box stores.	我对巨型零售商店并不抱有成见。
They are an enormous boon to low-income consumers, partly compensating for the tepid wage growth that many of them have suffered during the past two decades.	他们对低收入消费者而言是一个佳音，在某种程度上弥补了过去二十年中他们中的许多人所忍受的缓慢工资增长。
And I don’t agree with friends of mine who turn their noses down at Wal-Mart stores, and claim never to have visited one.	我有些朋友对沃尔玛店不屑一顾，宣称从来没有在那里购物，我也不赞同他们。
As a consumer, I think big-box stores are great.	作为一个消费者，我认为巨型零售店是一件好事。
They have certainly been great for America’s trading partners; Wal-Mart alone accounts for over 10% of all US imports from China.	对于美国的贸易伙伴来说它们无疑也是好事，仅仅沃尔玛一家就占美国进口中国商品的10％以上。
But I do have some reservations about the Wal-Mart model as a blueprint for global growth.	但是，我对沃尔玛模式作为全球性增长的蓝图却持有保留。
First, there is the matter of its effect on low-wage workers and smaller-scale retailers.	首先，这一模式对低工资工人以及小型零售者产生影响。
While completely legal, studies suggest that Wal-Mart’s labor policies exploit regulatory loopholes that, for example, allow it to sidestep the burden of healthcare costs for many workers (Wal-Mart provides healthcare coverage to less than half its workers).	研究报告表明，沃尔玛的劳工政策尽管完全合法，但是却钻法规的空子。 例如，这些空子让沃尔玛规避给许多雇员承担医疗费用（沃尔玛只给一半的雇员提供医疗保险 ） 。
And the entry of big-box stores into a community crushes long-established retailers, often traumatically transforming their character.	而且，巨型零售店进军某个社区，就会冲垮经营已久的零售者，经常痛楚地改变它们的性质。
Yes, to some extent, such is the price of progress.	是的，在某种程度上而言这的确是进步的代价。
But the loss of aesthetics and community is not easily captured in simple income and price statistics.	但是审美和社区的丧失并非可以轻而易举地用简单的收入和价格统计来加以俘获。
Big-box stores are not exactly attractive – hence their name.	巨型商店并非引人入胜，因此口碑也是如此。
If they continue their explosive growth over the next 20 years, will Americans someday come to regard their proliferation as a spectacular example of the failure to adopt region-wide blueprints for balanced growth?	如果在未来20年中继续爆炸式的增长，美国人是否会在某一天把它们的扩散视为未能采纳地区性平衡增长的巨大失败的例子呢？
Indeed, many Europeans, and others, will view Holmes’s video simulation of Wal-Mart’s spread as a horror film.	的确，许多欧洲人和其他人将会把赫尔姆斯有关沃尔玛扩散的录相模拟片视为恐怖电影。
The French may have invented the hyper mart – the forerunner of the big-box store – but they never intended to let their growth go unchecked.	也许是法国人发明了超市，也就是巨型超市的前身，但是他们从来就没有打算对其放任自流。
The big question for Europeans is whether they can find ways to exploit some of the efficiency gains embodied by the Wal-Mart model without being overrun by it.	欧洲人的大问题是，他们是否可以找到在不被吞没的情况下利用沃尔玛模式所体现的某些效率提高。
For Americans, there is the additional question of what to do when the big-box store phenomenon has run its course.	对于美国人而言还有一个问题，那就是当巨型商店现象长驱直入之时如何应对。
If so much of the US productivity edge really amounts to letting Wal-Mart and its big-box cousins run amok, what will happen after this source of growth tapers off?	如果美国生产效率领先的确意味着让沃尔玛以及其他巨型零售企业为所欲为，那么这一增长源泉枯竭后又当如何呢？
The US economy has many other strengths, including its superior financial system and leading position in high-tech capital goods, but the fact remains that America’s advantage in these areas has so far not been nearly as striking as the Wal-Mart phenomenon.	美国经济具有其他许多优势，包括其超人一等的金融体系以及在高科技资本商品上的领先地位，但是，美国在这些领域上的优势目前为止还没有像沃尔玛现象那样独树一帜也还是事实。
It is curious how many people seem to think that the US will grow faster than Europe and Japan over the next ten years simply because it has done so for the past ten years.	许多人似乎认为，仅仅由于在过去十年中美国经济增长快于欧洲和日本，因而在以后的二十年里也是如此。 这一观点不可思议。
Wal-Mart and its ilk are a central feature of the modern era of globalization.	沃尔玛及其同类就是现代全球化时代的中心特征。
They are not quite the pandemic that their explosive growth pattern resembles, but nor is their emergence completely benign.	它们并不是类似其爆炸式增长模式的传染病，但是其崛起也并非完全良性。
Those who would aim to emulate US productivity trends must come to grips with how they feel about big-box stores sprouting across their countryside’s, driving down wages and plowing under smaller-scale retailers.	那些想要模仿美国生产效率趋势的人们必须了解他们对巨型零售点遍布乡间、压低工资以及摧垮小规模零售商的感觉。
Americans, in turn, must think about where the proper balance lies between aesthetics, community, and low prices.	美国人反过来也必须考虑在审美、社区以及低工资之间取得适当的平衡。
	
Shaking Up “Shaken Baby Syndrome”	撼动“抖动婴儿综合征”
OXFORD – The most tragic event that can befall new parents is the sudden, unexpected death of their baby.	牛津—对新晋父母来说，最悲剧的事情莫过于孩子突然间意外死亡。
Perhaps the only thing worse is the parents being wrongly accused of causing the death, and indeed prosecuted, owing to the medical community’s misinterpretation of the findings.	也许唯一比这还要糟糕的是父母亲被错误地指责导致了孩子的死亡，并且因此被起诉，而造成这一幕的原因乃是医学界对发现的误解。
A small number of babies who collapse and die unexpectedly in their first year are found to have one or more of the following three symptoms in common: bleeding just outside the brain (subdural hemorrhage); bleeding at the back of the eye (retinal hemorrhage); and brain swelling.	少数在不满一周岁意外夭折的婴儿被发现有以下三种症候中的一种或多种：大脑外延出血（膜下出血 ） 、 眼底出血（视网膜出血）和脑水肿。
These same features are also seen in some babies who have suffered trauma, such as falls or motor-vehicle accidents.	同样的特征也见于一些受伤的婴儿，如坠落或车祸。
Yet many babies with these symptoms have no history or medical evidence of trauma (such as fractures, abrasions, or bruises), physical abuse, or neglect.	但许多存在这西症候的婴儿并无外伤（如骨折、擦伤或撞击 ） 、 身体虐待或被忽视的历史或医学证据。
Pediatricians wrestled with this conundrum until the 1970’s, when it was proposed that shaking might induce rotational forces and cause the “triad” of symptoms without bruises or fractures.	儿科医师一直在试图破解这一谜题，直到20世纪70年代才有人提出，震动可能造成旋转力，在没有擦伤和撞击的情况下导致“三重”症候。
Over the years, these findings evolved into “shaken baby syndrome” (SBS), a medico-legal hypothesis that remains contentious, and scientifically unproven, to this day.	多年来，这些发现进一步演化为“抖动婴儿综合症 ” （ shaken baby syndrome，SBS ） 。 SBS是目前仍是有争议的、没有获得科学证明的法医学假说。
The SBS hypothesis attributed the triad of symptoms to the physical rupture of blood vessels on the brain’s surface and in the retina, and the tearing of nerve fibers within the brain.	SBS假说将三重症候归因于大脑表面和视网膜内血管的病理性破裂以及大脑内神经纤维的撕裂。
It was suggested that these outcomes required a force equivalent to a multi-story fall or major motor-vehicle accident, causing immediate symptoms or collapse.	人们指出，这些结果需要相当于从多层楼高处掉落或严重车祸这么大的力才能造成，导致即刻生成的症候或死亡。
Because violent shaking cannot be accidental, the hypothesis simultaneously established a criminal act and identified the perpetrator, typically the person with the baby at the time of collapse.	由于暴力震动不可能是事故性的，因此该假说同时坐实了犯罪行为并能够认定施暴者，通常是婴儿致死现场所在人物。
Though the SBS hypothesis was incorporated into medical training and judicial decisions worldwide, it remained untested for almost two decades.	尽管SBS假说已在全世界范围被纳入医学训练和司法判决，但在近20年的时间里，它并没有经受过测试。
In 1987, the first biomechanical experiments found that the force of shaking is much less than that of impact and concluded that shaking alone was unlikely to cause the triad of symptoms.	1987年，第一次生物力学实验发现，震动力远远小于撞击力，因此仅凭震动不可能造成三重症候。
Subsequent research in my specialty, pediatric neuropathology, established that the medical basis for the SBS hypothesis was also flawed.	我所在专业 — — 儿科神经学的后续研究发现，SBS假说的医学基础也是有漏洞的。
We learned that the brain damage in these children did not reflect trauma to nerve fibers, but rather a failure of blood supply.	我们了解到，这些孩子的大脑损伤并不反映神经纤维外伤，而是反映了供血失灵。
We also learned that the typical subdural hemorrhages in these cases are too thin to result from the rupture of the large bridging veins on the brain’s surface.	我们还了解到，这些案例中的典型的膜下出血很薄，不可能来自大脑表层大型桥静脉的断裂。
And we learned that the same findings are seen in natural deaths.	我们还了解到，同样的发现也见于自然死亡。
In the last decade, the list of other causes – including accidental trauma, congenital causes, and natural illness – has continued to grow.	在过去十年中，其他原因 — — 包括事故外伤、先天性因素和自然疾病等 — — 一直在不断涌现。
Perhaps the most compelling observation in recent years is that subdural hemorrhages are present in nearly half of normal, healthy newborns with no evidence of birth trauma.	也许最近几年来最有说服力的发现是，膜下出血现象在近一半的没有分娩外伤痕迹的健康新生儿身上出现。
These findings, combined with the immature anatomy of the infant dura, suggest that dural bleeding in young babies may be a natural protective device – a reservoir to prevent backflow into the brain’s blood vessels during the pressure fluctuations of normal labor and delivery.	这些发现，加上婴儿硬脑膜发育不成熟，表明新生儿脑膜出血可能是天然保护机制 — — 为了防止正常劳作和分娩时压力波动造成血液回流大脑血管。
Because these anatomical features persist into early childhood, the dura may remain similarly vulnerable to bleeding beyond the newborn period.	由于这些解剖学特征一直持续到早期童年，因此脑膜可能一直保持类似的易出血状态直到新生儿阶段后。
Indeed, both birth-related bleeds and those attributed to shaking are most often located in the folds of membranes covering the brain that have more and larger blood vessels at this age than later in life.	事实上，不管是与出生有关的出血，还是被归因于震动的出血，通常都位于包裹大脑的膜的褶皱处，这些部位的血管在初生时比日后更大。
While scientific evidence over the last three decades has undermined the shaken baby hypothesis, no new evidence has emerged to support it.	过去三十年来的科学证据不支持抖动婴儿假说，也没有新证据出现支持它。
Instead, several researchers have relied upon the data in older studies to calculate the statistical probability of inflicted brain injury when certain features (such as intracranial hemorrhage, retinal hemorrhage, brain swelling, and seizures) are present.	相反，一些研究者根据旧研究中的数据计算出现某些特征（如颅内出血、视网膜出血、脑水肿和癫痫）情况下的大脑损伤的统计概率。
These probabilities are then offered as the basis for diagnosis and as evidence in court.	这些概率常常被用于诊断依据和法庭证据。
However, the reasoning behind the studies on which these researchers rely is circular, and based on assumptions now known to be unreliable.	但是，这些研究者的研究所基于的逻辑是��套逻辑，其基础假设现已知道是不可靠的。
For example, in some studies, the researchers decided arbitrarily that falls of less than one meter could not harm a baby, so that parents who described such a fall must be lying.	比如，在一些研究中，研究者武断地认定不足一米高度跌落不会伤害婴儿，因此描述此类跌落情形的父母一定在撒谎。
Other studies viewed the parents’ inability to explain the findings as evidence of abuse.	其他研究认为，父母对发现无力辩解便是虐待的证据。
Given these flaws, reviews of old studies do not provide a reliable evidence base for diagnosing abuse.	由于存在这些缺陷，对旧研究的再检视无法为确认虐待提供可靠证据。
They simply predict the likelihood that specific findings will be categorized as abusive, and that, consequently, the child’s caregiver at the time will be accused or convicted of abuse, regardless of the accuracy of the diagnosis.	它们只不过预测了具体发现可被归于虐待的概率，以及可以指控或确认当时在场的儿童看护者虐待的概率，确认的准确性并无保障。
Leading proponents of the SBS hypothesis now acknowledge that the triad is a “myth,” that SBS diagnoses consist of “informed speculation,” and that the hypothesis is supported solely by confessions.	SBS假说的主要支持者现在也承认，三重症候是一个“传说 ” ， SBS确认是“有根据的猜测 ” ， SBS假说的支持证据完全来自坦白。
Some courts are following suit, with one US federal judge describing the types of confessions obtained as “worthless as evidence,” and another noting that, given recent developments, claims of SBS may be “more an article of faith than a proposition of science.”	一些法庭已有所跟进，一位美国联邦法官宣布以此获得的坦白“作为证据毫无价值 ” ， 另一位美国联邦法官指出，根据最新发展，SBS或许“更多地是一种信念，而不是一项科学 ” 。
No one questions whether infants can be damaged or killed by violent shaking or abuse; of course they can.	没有人会质疑婴儿是否可能因为暴力震动或虐待而受伤甚至致死；当然是可能的。
The real issue is whether shaking or abuse can be inferred on the basis of a hypothesis that lacks scientific support.	真正的问题在于是否可以根据缺少科学依据的假说推断震动或虐待。
In no other area of medicine and law would an unproved hypothesis provide a basis for diagnosis, let alone criminal prosecution.	其他医学和法律领域都没有让未经证明的假说作为确认依据的做法，更不用说刑事指控了。
Given the developments of the past decade, we now face the possibility that for the past 30 years we have been wrongly imprisoning parents on the basis of a flawed hypothesis.	从过去十年的发展来看，我们面临着一种可能性 — — 过去30年来，我们根据一项有缺陷的假说错误地将许多父母亲送入了监狱。
	
China’s North Korean Pivot	中国的朝鲜重点
BEIJING – After a spring of heightened tension on the Korean Peninsula, a flurry of diplomatic activity in recent weeks has brought some hope of a meeting of the minds, at least between China, South Korea, and the United States.	北京—在经历了一个朝鲜半岛局势紧张的春天后，最近几周的一系列外交活动带来了形成一致的希望，至少在中国、韩国和美国之间是如此。
But the emergence of a viable consensus on how to minimize the security risks emanating from North Korea’s mercurial leadership remains to be found.	但关于如何将来自朝鲜领导层的变化无常的风险降到最低，目前还有待形成可行的一致意见
After a reportedly tough meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Vice Marshall Choe Ryong-hae, one of the four members of North Korea’s ruling presidium, the US-China summit in California took place with North Korea as one of the central points of discussion.	据称中国主席习近平和朝鲜副元帅、四人最高统治集团成员之一崔龙海进行了艰难的会谈，随后，加利福尼亚州中美峰会将朝鲜问题作为讨论的核心议题之一。
This was quickly followed by a Beijing summit between Xi and South Korean President Park Geun-hye.	中美峰会后，习近平与韩国总统朴槿惠马上在北京举行了峰会。
The fact that Xi participated in all three meetings underscores two truths: China’s policy toward North Korea is the key to a solution to the problems posed by North Korea, and China may be actively searching for a new approach to its wayward ally.	习近平参与了三次会面这一事实暗示了两大真相：中国对朝政策是形成针对朝鲜造成的问题的解决方案的关键；以及中国或许正在积极寻找对付其不安分的盟友的新方法。
China’s interest in a new North Korea policy is not entirely new.	中国对新朝鲜政策的兴趣算不上全新。
After all, China’s policy toward the country has been gradually moving in a more constructive direction for the past two decades, reflecting China’s growing international prominence, as well as its leaders’ cautious embrace of the global role that their country’s new economic might has provided.	毕竟，过去二十年来，中国对朝政策一直在逐渐朝更具建设性的方向改变，这反映出中国日渐提高的国际突出地位以及其领导人谨慎行使中国经济实力带来的全球影响力的态度。
In the immediate post-Cold War period, China cooperated with other concerned parties in the process of resolving the first North Korea nuclear crisis of 1993-1994; but it tended to regard the North’s nuclear ambitions mainly as a bilateral issue between North Korea and the US.	冷张时代结束伊始，1993—1994年中国就与其他相关方面合作解决了第一次朝鲜核危机；但它倾向于将朝鲜和野心视为主要是朝鲜和美国的之间的双边问题。
President Bill Clinton seemed to agree, and adopted a bilateral approach to the nuclear crisis, which resulted in the two countries’ Agreed Framework of 1994.	美国总统克林顿似乎也这样认为，并对朝鲜核危机采取双边主义方法，并于1994年与朝鲜达成框架协议。
But China upgraded its role in the 2000’s.	但进入21世纪后，中国的作用开始升级。
After North Korea’s enriched uranium program triggered another crisis in late 2002, President George W. Bush wanted to mobilize China’s influence in a more systematic way.	2002年底，朝鲜铀浓缩计划触发了又一场危机，小布什总统希望动员中国的影响力以形成更加系统性的方法。
But China’s leaders balked, circumscribing their role severely.	但中国领导人踯躅不前，小心翼翼地控制着自己的角色。
Though Chinese leaders became more active by hosting the six-party talks, they still regarded their role as that of mediator between the US and the North, rather than that of a party whose security interests were seriously affected by events on the Korean Peninsula.	尽管中国领导人通过主办六方会谈表现出更积极的态度，但仍把自己视为美国和朝鲜之间的调停人，而不是安全利益受朝鲜半岛局势严重影响的当事方。
Immediately after the North’s second nuclear test in 2009, Chinese officials undertook a review of their country’s North Korea policy and decided to separate the nuclear issue from the overall bilateral relationship.	在2009年朝鲜进行第二次核试验后，中国官员马上反思了中国的对朝政策，决定将朝鲜核问题与全面双边关系分离。
Thus, former Prime Minister Wen Jiabao visited Pyongyang in October 2009 and promised generous economic aid.	于是，前总理温家宝于2009年10月访问平壤，承诺给予朝鲜丰厚的经济援助。
Chinese leaders may have believed that inducing the North to adopt the Chinese model of economic opening would create a better political environment for denuclearization.	中国领导人或许认为让朝鲜采取中国的经济开放模式能为去核化创造更好的政治环境。
One result was a deepening of North Korea’s economic dependence on China.	这一政策的一个结果是朝鲜经济更加依赖中国了。
But the big problem was that the North’s leadership apparently interpreted China’s policy as a sign of unwillingness to pressure the North on nuclear matters.	但大问题是朝鲜领导人显然将中国的这一政策解读为不愿意就核问题向朝鲜施压的信号。
Indeed, North Korean behavior became much more provocative, including an attack in 2010 that sank the South Korean corvette Cheonan and another in which the South’s Yeonpyeong Island was shelled.	事实上，朝鲜的行为变得更具挑衅性，包括在2010年炮击延坪岛，击沉韩国巡洋舰天安号和另一艘军舰。
Following this spring’s round of North Korean provocations, Xi appears to have concluded that enough is enough.	在今年春天朝鲜又一次挑衅后，习近平似乎感到忍无可忍。
As a result, China’s North Korea policy has entered a new stage.	于是，中国的朝鲜政策迈入了新阶段。
Xi’s criticism of the North’s nuclear ambitions has become both unusually public and blunt.	习近平对朝鲜和野心的批评反常地公开且尖锐。
Chinese leaders may still view North Korea as a strategic buffer state, but China’s status as a global power is pushing them to view the North in a new way.	中国领导人或许仍把朝鲜视为战略缓冲国，但中国作为国际大国的地位使其以新视角看待朝鲜。
Former State Councilor Tang Jiaxuan was even reported to have said recently that denuclearization is now a higher priority for China than stabilization of the Korean Peninsula.	据报道，前国务委员唐家璇最近甚至表示如今对中国来说朝鲜半岛的去核化比朝鲜半岛的稳定更加重要。
This approach should favor China’s global strategy, which is premised upon Xi’s desire to build a new type of “major power” relationship between China and the US (the Chinese government prefers “major power” to “great power,” probably in order to highlight its stated renunciation of hegemonic ambition).	这一立场有利于中国的全球战略 — — 该战略的前提是习近平建立中美新型“大国”关系的渴望（中国政府喜欢用“大国”而不是“强国 ” ， 可能是为了突出其不称霸的原则 ） 。
Indeed, among the myriad unresolved issues dividing the US and China, North Korea’s nuclear program is the one most likely to impede mutual trust.	事实上，在中美存在分歧的诸多未解决问题中，朝鲜核计划是最有可能妨碍双方互信的问题之一。
If the US and China are to avoid being steered by North Korea onto a collision course, they probably have four or five years to pursue a joint strategy – a timetable established by the point at which North Korea could have the technology to load miniaturized nuclear warheads atop long-range missiles.	如果美国和中国欲避免被朝鲜引诱而发生碰撞，它们或许有四到五年时间追求联合战略 — — 即朝鲜获得制造小型远程导弹核弹头技术所需要的时间。
As the North approaches this point, the US will have to strengthen its missile defenses in the western Pacific – areas close to China – in order to deter the North Korean threat.	如果朝鲜掌握了这一技术，美国将不得不强化其西太平洋（接近中国的地区）的导弹防御，以消除朝鲜的威胁。
The result, invariably, will be heightened Sino-US tension.	其结果免不了将加剧中美紧张。
China has no interest in such an outcome.	如此结局不符合中国的利益。
The long-term costs of a worsening security confrontation with the US would exceed the short-term tactical benefits to be derived from continuing to support the North as a buffer state, especially given China’s deepening relationship with South Korea.	对美安全冲突恶化的长期成本将压倒继续支持朝鲜作为缓冲国所获得的战术好处，特别是在中国欲韩国关系深化的条件下。
Though Park’s visit to Beijing has not closed the gap between the Chinese and South Korean approaches to the North Korean nuclear issue, it does seem to have prepared the ground for closer coordination between the two governments.	尽管朴槿惠的北京之行并没有完全弥合中国和韩国关于朝鲜核问题的分歧，但的确为两国政府跟紧密的合作做了铺垫。
Those improved ties matter, because the time has come for China to rebalance its traditional geostrategic interests with its role as a global leader.	这些关系的改善十分重要，因为中国需要重新平衡其传统地缘政治利益和全球领袖的角色。
That calls for a Chinese policy of disciplined engagement toward North Korea, without which an internationally coordinated solution to the nuclear problem – and, with it, the promise of more productive relations with the US and South Korea – will be impossible.	这需要中国为朝鲜制定纪律，否则朝鲜核问题的国际合作解决方案就无法实现，与美国和韩国建立更加建设性的关系的承诺也无法兑现。
	
Wanted: An Arab Jean Monnet	寻找阿拉伯的让·莫内
The Middle East is beyond doubt one of the most dangerous crisis regions worldwide.	毫无疑问中东是全世界最危险的危机高发区。
The next war, terrorist attack, or failed peace initiative may lurk just around the corner.	下一场战争、恐怖袭击或和平倡议的失败都使其四伏的危机随时可能爆发。
Compared to the politics of this region, a rollercoaster ride is downright calming.	相对于这一地区的政治局势来说，坐过山车的感觉应该算是让人十分心平气和的了。
And yet the Middle East is also a region that, throughout its innumerable conflicts, has hardly changed, languishing in a strange kind of standstill.	然而，也正是中东这样一个地区，经过了无数的冲突后，几乎没有发生任何变化，至今仍在一种怪异的停滞不前的状态中煎熬。
There must be an intrinsic correlation between the lack of developmental dynamism of most Middle Eastern societies and the fact that the region is so crisis-prone.	大部分的中东地区的社会缺乏发展的活力，而且该地区是如此容易发生危机，这两者之间一定存在着内在的联系。
The conflict between Israel and the Palestinians stands out as an example of the static nature of this key geopolitical region, because it seems to be completely unaffected by any international upheaval.	以色列和巴勒斯坦之间的冲突，是这一重要地缘政治区域的停滞不前的一个突出例子，因为这种冲突似乎完全不受任何国际形势动荡的影响。
The Ottomans, the British, decolonization, the Cold War, numerous American Presidents, and even more international mediators have come and gone, but the parameters of this conflict and the inability to find a solution never seem to change.	土耳其人、英国人、非殖民化、冷战、多任美国总统，甚至更多的国际调停人士来了又去，可是这一冲突的各种特征，以及找不到解决办法的困窘，似乎从未改变过。
However, this impression – correct where the past is concerned – might prove deceptive in the future, because two global megatrends will subject the region to more profound change than all the many previous political crises and wars were able to bring about.	然而，这一印象，尽管从过去的历史来看是正确的，但可能在未来会被证明具有迷惑性，因为有两个全球大趋势，将给该地区带来前无所有变化，这些变化比过去多场政治危机和战争所带来的所有变化的总和还要更为深刻。
The first is globalization, by which ever-larger parts of the Arab world, beginning with the Persian Gulf and its oil countries, will be influenced, albeit slowly, both economically and culturally.	第一是全球化，从波斯湾和该地区的产油国开始，阿拉伯世界越来越大的部分将受此大趋势的影响。 尽管全球化对其影响，无论在经济上还是文化上，其速度都是缓慢的。
With the shift of wealth and power from the West to the East, the pressures of globalization will increasingly come from the East.	随着财富和权力从西方向东方转移，全球化的压力将越来越多地来自东方。
In Morocco, for instance, investment from the Arab oil countries has already significantly reduced Europe’s importance.	例如，在摩洛哥，来自阿拉伯产油国的投资已经大大削弱了欧洲的重要性。
The inherent contradiction between a governance structure incapable of change and economic modernization, between cultural and religious conservatism and social and normative transformation, will therefore increase and bring about new, additional frictions if positive answers to these fundamental changes cannot be found.	无法进行变革的治理结构和经济现代化之间的矛盾，文化和宗教保守主义和社会规范变革之间的矛盾，如果无法找到解决这些根本性变化的正面答案，这些固有的矛盾将加剧和带来新的、更多的摩擦。
The second megatrend is the global climate crisis.	第二个大趋势是全球的气候危机。
Apart from those countries that are threatened – partly or completely –by rising sea levels, global warming will primarily affect the desert belts and their already precarious water supplies.	除了那些部分或完全受到海平面上升的威胁国家，全球气候变暖还将主要影响沙漠带和那些地区已经岌岌可危的水供应。
And, while the conflicts in the Middle East are primarily about territory, this includes the scarce water resources so essential for survival.	虽然中东的冲突主要是领土方面的，但也包括生存所必需的稀缺的水资源问题。
Rapid population growth, a dramatic increase in water consumption due to industrial, agricultural, and tourism growth, and rising standards of living will make the water issue even more important to the region’s political stability than it is already.	人口的迅速增长、工农业和旅游业增长所引起的水消耗量大幅增长以及不断提高的生活水准，使现在已经对该地区的政治稳定起重要作用的水问题变得愈加重要。
A sustainable answer to questions of such vital importance to the Middle East only makes sense if it is regional in character.	要回答这类对中东至关重要的问题并使答案有说服力，答案必须是针对整个区域的才会有意义。
And the same applies to the increasing demand for energy: although the region as a whole is rich in energy resources, their uneven geographical distribution suggests that any viable solution must be built on cooperation.	这个标准也同样适用于能源需求增加的问题上：尽管整个地区有丰富的能源资源，但地域分布不平衡；这说明，任何可行的解决方案必须建立在合作的基础上。
Of course, resolving the political crises and conflicts remains the top priority.	当然，解决政治危机和冲突仍是首要任务。
To make regional peace and stability possible, however, the region’s very young and rapidly increasing populations require an economic perspective that makes their participation in globalization possible – in a dignified manner and grounded in their own culture and history.	然而，为了使区域的和平与稳定成为可能，该地区的非常年轻的、并迅速膨胀的人口，需要一个经济的视角使他们能够有尊严地、并基于自身的文化和历史上参与全球化进程。
The Middle East’s individual states won’t be able to manage this without regional cooperation.	没有区域合作，中东的各分散的国家将无法做到上述这一点。
The European Union’s successful track record could therefore provide an almost perfect model.	因此，欧盟的成功可以提供一个近乎完美的榜样。
In fact, the preconditions for intra-regional cooperation – up to partial integration of the interests of the countries involved – look more auspicious than they did in Western Europe in the early 1950’s.	事实上，区域内合作的先决条件-参与的国家的利益部分一体化-看起来更比五十年代初的西欧更加成熟和有希望。
Europe had neither a common language, nor was it as religiously and culturally as homogeneous as the Middle East.	那时的欧洲既没有共同语言也不如中东在宗教和文化上那样具有同质性。
For Europe, the starting point was visionary leaders like Jean Monnet and the creation of new institutions like the Coal and Steel Community.	欧洲的出发点是出现了让·莫内那样富有远见的领导人和新机构如煤钢共同体的创立。
In the Middle East, the process of regional integration could begin with water and energy.	在中东，区域一体化进程可以从与水和能源着手。
A common market for goods and services could follow, along with a regional security system.	加上区域安全体系，一个商品和服务的共同市场便可以跟进。
This would, finally, give the Middle East – a region poor in growth and rich in conflicts – a distinct identity, making it a player in global economic terms as well, and thus enabling it to become the architect of its own future.	这最终会给中东-这个缺乏增长但不乏冲突的地区-一个独特的身份，使其也成为在全球经济领域种的一个角色，进而使它能设计自己的未来。
Europe, once the continent of war, has shown that this is possible.	曾经战事频繁的欧洲大陆已经证明了这是可能的。
And Europe can help the Middle East – its neighboring region – achieve this strategic objective.	欧洲可以帮助中东，也是它的区域邻居，实现这一战略目标。
An instrument for it already exists: the new Union for the Mediterranean.	一个实现目标的工具已经存在：新成立的地中海联盟。
In any case, the time of standstill in the Middle East is coming to an end.	总之，中东停滞不前的时代即将结束。
Whether the consequences of this development will be good or bad depends on whether the region can muster the foresight and strength actively to shape this process.	这种发展的后果是好是坏，取决于该地区是否能拿出远见和力量积极创造这一进程。
Imagination, vision, and pragmatic perseverance will be necessary.	想象力、远见和务实的毅力是必需的。
What is needed now is an Arabian Jean Monnet.	现在需要一个阿拉伯的让·莫内。
	
A Fresh Look at the Afghan War	看待阿富汗战争的全新视角
NEW YORK – With the Syria crisis dominating headlines, few are paying attention to America’s longest war.	纽约—随着叙利亚危机占据媒体头条，很少有人关注美国持续时间最长的战争。
In fact, the war in Afghanistan has hardly been mentioned in the early months of US President Donald Trump’s administration, despite the presence of two experienced military officers – Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster – in key positions.	事实上，阿富汗战争在美国总统特朗普上台后的几个月来极少被提及，尽管两位经验丰富的军官 — — 国防部长马蒂斯和国家安全顾问麦克马斯特 — — 身居要职。
This must change.	这必须改变。
After 15 years of failed intervention, the situation in Afghanistan is out of control.	在进行了15年的失败的干预后，阿富汗局面已经失控。
The unity government that emerged after the contested presidential election of 2014 is dysfunctional, and security conditions are rapidly deteriorating.	2014年充满争议的总统选举后所形成的统一政府无法正常运转，安全环境也在迅速恶化。
Meanwhile, opium production is surging, and Afghanistan now ranks second in the world in money laundering (after Iran).	与此同时，阿富汗鸦片产量飙升，并且目前已经位列洗钱世界排行榜第二名（仅次于伊朗 ） 。
In Europe and elsewhere, inflows of Afghan refugees continue unabated.	在欧洲和其他地区，阿富汗难民不断地涌入。
The war in Afghanistan has exacted enormous costs.	阿富汗战争已经造成了巨大的代价。
So far, fatalities include roughly 3,500 coalition soldiers (some 70% of which were US troops), about the same number of contractors, and some 100,000 Afghans (including security forces, opposition fighters, and civilians).	目前，死亡名单包括大约3,500名联军士兵（其中70%为美军 ） ， 大约相同数量的承包商，以及大约100,000名阿富汗人（包括安全部队、反对派武装和平民 ） 。
Since 2002, the US has spent over $780 billion on the war – roughly equivalent to the entire US foreign-affairs budget for more than two decades.	自2002年以来，美国已在这场战争中投入了7,800亿多美元 — — 大约相当于二十多年来美国外交事务预算的总和。
Additional non-budgetary expenditure, including disability payments and compensation to the families of fallen soldiers, will add hundreds of billions more to the war’s total cost.	如果算上额外的非预算开支，包括残疾赔偿金和阵亡将士抚恤金，这场战争的总代价还要在增加几百亿美元。
The war in Afghanistan was supposed to be over a long time ago.	阿富汗战争理应早就结束了。
After all, US troops did not enter the country to reconstruct it or create a democracy.	毕竟，美军进入阿富汗不是为了它的复兴或建立一个民主国家。
But a series of missteps – misguided civilian policies and misplaced priorities on the part of the government and its donors – have boosted recruitment for the very groups the US is supposed to be quelling, including al-Qaeda, the Afghan Taliban, and, more recently, the Islamic State.	但一系列失误 — — 错误的民事政策和政府及其出资者的错误的工作重点 — — 让美国准备清剿的武装力量更加壮大了，它们包括基地组织、阿富汗塔利班以及最近的伊斯兰国。
The “nation-building” and counterinsurgency strategy that accompanied US President Barack Obama’s troop surge in 2010 was meant to turn the war around.	2010年伴随奥巴马总统的增兵而提出的“建国”和平叛战略原本是为了扭转战局。
Instead, as US and allied troops left areas that had supposedly been “cleared,” the Taliban and other extremist groups soon returned.	相反，随着美国和联军离开应该已经“清理”的地区，塔利班和其他极端组织很快死灰复燃。
The 43% increase in opium production in just the last year both reflects and reinforces the growing strength of these groups, which use drug-trafficking revenues to finance their operations.	仅仅在去年，鸦片产量就增加了43 % ， 这既反映、也增强了这些组织的优势，它们利用贩毒的收入来为行动提供资金。
Of global annual flows of 430-450 tons of heroin and morphine, about 380 tons are produced with Afghan opium.	在全球每年430—450吨的海洛因和吗啡流通量中，大约380吨是用阿富汗鸦片生产的。
Meanwhile, Afghanistan has been allowed to fall into an aid trap.	与此同时，美国坐看阿富汗陷入了援助陷阱。
The US has disbursed about $110 billion for Afghan reconstruction.	美国拿出了大约1,100亿美元用于阿富汗复兴。
(Adjusted for inflation, that is equivalent to the $12.5 billion cost of the Marshall Plan for reconstruction in Europe after World War II.)	（经通胀调整，大约相当于二战后复兴欧洲的马歇尔计划所投入了125亿美元 ） 。
Roughly $70 billion of those funds went to creating and financing Afghan security forces, and $40 billion went to non-military expenditure.	其中大约700亿被用于建立阿富汗安全力量并提供经费，400亿被用于非军事开支。
Yet, despite all that spending, Afghanistan will be unable to stand on its own feet for decades to come.	但尽管投入了巨资，阿富汗仍然不可能在未来几十年中自力更生。
The country’s cumulative GDP from 2002 to 2015 was only $170 billion; GDP in 2016 totaled just $17 billion, or $525 per capita.	2002—2015年，阿富汗累计GDP只有1,700亿美元；2016年GDP总共只有170亿美元，或人均525美元。
Non-military aid from the US and others has amounted to 50% of GDP, on average, every year since 2002. And that aid has consistently been delivered in the same inefficient ways, even as the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) and others have repeatedly highlighted enormous amounts of waste, fraud, and abuse.	自2002年以来，来自美国和其他国家的非军事援助平均每年都要占GDP的50%而这些援助一直以效率低下的方式交付，即使美国阿富汗复兴特别检察官（SIGAR）和其他官员反复强调存在巨大的资金浪费、欺诈和滥用。
As the Trump administration alters US foreign-policy priorities, devising a more effective strategy for America’s Afghan operations must be a priority.	随着特朗普政府改变美国的外交政策重点，制定更有效的美国阿富汗行动战略必须作为重点。
Only after such a strategy is in place should the administration meet the US military’s requests to send more troops.	只有在落实了这一战略后，政府才应该满足美军继续增兵的要求。
Fortunately, both Mattis and McMaster know that simply throwing more troops and more money at Afghanistan won’t do the job.	幸运的是，马蒂斯和麦克马斯特都知道，仅仅向阿富汗投入更多部队和更多金钱根本无济于事。
Indeed, both have emphasized the need to support counterinsurgency operations with effective policies that do not create new enemies and fuel the need for “more ammunition.”	事实上，他们两人都强调要用不会创造新敌人和助长“更多弹药”的需求的有效政策来支持平叛行动。
Retired high-level officers from all branches of the US Armed Forces have taken this logic a step further, telling congressional leaders that combating terrorism requires addressing its causes, such as lack of opportunity, insecurity, injustice, and hopelessness.	美军各军种退休高级军官顺着这一逻辑更进一步，对国会领导人表示打击恐怖主义要直击其根源，比如缺少机会、不安全、不公平和没有希望。
To create more cost-effective, integrated, and inclusive policies that benefit most Afghans, not just the privileged few, US leaders will need to engage in some radical rethinking.	要制定更具性价比、更全面、更包容的政策，从而让大部分阿富汗人而不是一小撮特权人士受益，美国领导人需要进行一些彻底的反思。
Various proposals are on the table, including one of my own: to create synergistic “reconstruction zones” (RZs) – one aimed at local production and another aimed at exports – that support economic recovery.	可供选择的方案有很多，我本人也提出了一份：建立协同“复兴区 ” — —其一针对本地生产，其二针对出口 — — 以支持经济复苏。
Such RZs can help the resource-rich Afghanistan to replace aid with foreign direct investment and export revenues.	这些复兴区能帮助资源富裕的阿富汗用外国直接投资和出口收入代替援助。
Foreign investors would work in support of local communities, enabling them to produce food and services for local consumption, rather than displacing them, as is so often the case.	外国投资者将帮助支持本地社区，让它们能够生产满足本地消费的食品和服务，而不是像经常发生的那样取代它们。
In exchange, the communities would protect the RZs, so that investors can produce for export at a lower security risk.	作为交换，这些社区要保护复兴区，以使投资者可以在较低的安全风险环境下生产出口产品。
After 15 years of conflict, ending the war in Afghanistan may seem to have lost some of its urgency.	阿富汗冲突已经爆发了15年，结束这场战争似乎已经不再那么紧迫。
But the truth is that it is more urgent than ever, not just to check the flows of refugees to Europe and elsewhere, but also to undermine terrorist recruitment efforts.	但真相是它其实比以往任何时候都更加紧迫，不仅是为了遏制涌向欧洲和其他地区的难民流，也是为了阻止恐怖分子的招募工作。
By promoting “impact investment” by those seeking both economic gain and social progress, and by advancing projects that benefit foreign investors and local communities alike, the Trump administration may be able to do just that.	通过促进由追求经济收益和社会进步的投资者进行的“影响力投资 ” ， 以及通过推进同时有利于外国投资者和本地社区的项目，特朗普政府或能够完成这一工作。
	
Washington and the Art of the Possible	华盛顿和可能的艺术
CHICAGO – These days, the United States media are full of ordinary Americans venting their rage at the incompetence and immaturity of their politicians.	芝加哥 — — 近日来，美国各大媒体充斥着普通美国人对美国政客无能和不成熟的愤怒。
Even though the US government’s debt limit was raised in the nick of time, the process was – and remains – fraught with risk.	美国政府在关键时刻终于成功地提高了债务上限，但整个过程险象环生，而且尚未脱离危险。
Why, the public asks, can’t politicians sit down together like sensible adults and come up with a timely agreement that commands broad consensus?	公众怒问，为什么政客们不能像理智的成年人那样坐下来好好谈，及时达成广泛一致？
If we can balance our household budgets, they ask irately, why can’t our political leaders?	公众怒问，既然我们可以实现家庭预算平衡，为什么政客们就不行呢？
The reality, though, is that US politicians reflect the views of the American electorate – views that are fundamentally inconsistent. The absence of broad consensus is no wonder.	然而，现实是美国政客所代表的正是美国全体选民的意见，而全体选民的意见注定不会一致，这丝毫都不令人奇怪。
Indeed, the last-minute agreement to raise the debt ceiling is proof that the politicians did what they were sent to Washington to do: represent their constituencies and only compromise in the interests of the country as a whole.	事实上，在最后一刻就提升债务上限达成一致倒是证明，政客们完成了自己的使命：代表自己的选区，只对全美国整体利益让步。
The key question is whether the political gridlock exposed by the debt-ceiling debate will worsen in the run-up to the 2012 presidential and congressional elections – if not beyond.	关键的问题是，由债务上限争论导致的政治僵局是否会对2012年（甚至此后各届）总统和国会选举造成不良影响。
That is possible, but we should not overlook cause for hope in what America’s politicians just accomplished.	这并非不可能，但我们也不应该忽视美国政客刚刚所取得的成果。
Let’s start with why the electorate is so polarized.	让我们从选民为何会如此两极分化开始。
There are two key divisive factors: income and age.	其中的决定性因素有二：收入和年龄。
Income inequality has been growing in the US over the last three decades, largely because the labor market has increasingly demanded skills that the education system has been unable to supply.	过去三十年来，美国的收入不平等情况一直在恶化，这大部分是因为教育体系越来越难以满足劳动力市场所要求的技能。
The everyday consequence for the middle class is a stagnant paycheck and growing employment insecurity, as the old economy of well-paying low-skilled jobs with good benefits withers away.	这给中产阶级带来了怎样的后果呢？ 薪金增长停滞，失业风险增加，因为低技能要求的高薪高福利旧经济一去不复返了。
Until the financial crisis, the easy availability of credit, especially against home equity, enabled the middle class to sustain higher consumption despite stagnant incomes.	在金融危机爆发前，信贷泛滥（特别是住房信贷）让中产阶级得以维系高消费水平，尽管他们的收入并未增加。
With the collapse of the housing bubble, many people lost their jobs and health insurance, risked losing their homes, and suddenly had little reason for economic optimism.	随着房地产泡沫的破裂，许多人丢到了自己的工作和医疗保险，还面临着丢掉房子的风险，一夜之间，他们就失去了所有对经济保持乐观的理由。
The response from America’s Democratic Party, which has traditionally represented this constituency, was to promise affordable universal health care and more education spending, while also protecting government jobs and entitlement programs.	传统上代表这类选民的民主党提出的应对措施是承诺推行人人负担得起的普适医保以及增加教育支出，同时保证政府工作岗位和权利计划。
When added up, such spending is unaffordable, especially with current federal revenues at just 15% of GDP.	但我们把所需支出一加总就会发现这根本是无法负担的，特别是在联邦岁入只有GDP的15%的情况下。
The solution for many Democrats is to raise revenues by taxing the rich.	在很多民主党看来，这可以通过向富人征税以增加岁入来解决。
But the rich are not the idle rich of the past; they are the working rich.	但富人已经不再是过去的有闲阶级了；现在的富人是劳动致富的。
To balance the budget only by taxing the rich will require a significant increase in income taxes, to the point that it would lower incentives for work and entrepreneurial activity considerably.	仅仅依靠向富人征税来平衡预算将使所得税大幅提高，就目前的情况而言，这会大大降低努力工作的激励和企业家行为。
This is not to say that taxes on the rich cannot be increased at all; but such increases cannot be the primary way of balancing the budget.	这并不是说完全不能对富人增税；但增税不应该作为平衡预算的首选方案。
Republicans, trying to give voice to many working Americans’ ambient uneasiness with rising government expenditures, as well as to the growing anger of the working rich, find it easier to defend a principle than a particular constituency.	共和党试图吐出美国劳动阶级的心声 — — 境况越来越差，而政府支出越来越大，同时也试图代表劳动致富的富人表达心中的愤怒。 他们知道，维系选民支持比捍卫原则容易多了。
Hence their mantra: no additional taxes.	因此，共和党的口号是：不加税。
The neat divide based on income is muddled by the elderly.	收入带来的分歧是明确的，但年龄则否。
It is understandable that older Americans who have few savings want to protect their Social Security and Medicare benefits.	不难理解，没有多少积蓄的老年人希望保护他们的社会保险和医疗保险福利。
However, even elderly Tea Party Republicans, who are typically against big government, defend these programs because they view them as a form of property right, paid for when they worked.	但是，即使是通常反对大政府的高龄茶党共和党人现在也在捍卫这些计划，因为他们将它们视为产权，是他们通过自己过去的劳动所应获得的报酬。
In truth, rising life expectancy and growing health-care costs mean that today’s elderly have contributed only a fraction of what they expect to receive from Social Security and Medicare.	事实上，预期寿命的提高与医疗成本的膨胀意味着与当前老年人所期待获得的社会保险和医疗保险福利比起来，他们对社会所做的贡献实在不值一提。
The government made a mistake in the past by not raising taxes to finance these programs or reducing the benefits that they promised.	政府过去犯了一个错误，没有增税来为这些计划融资，也没有削减福利承诺。
Unless the growth of these entitlement programs is curbed now, today’s young will pay dearly for that mistake, in the form of higher taxes now and lower benefits when they are old.	除非这些权利计划现在可以被削减，否则这个错误将极大增加现今年青一代的负担 — — 他们将在现在承担高税收，而在年老时享受低福利。
But the elderly are politically active and powerful.	但老年人在政治上更活跃，也更有影响力。
Not only do many defend their entitlements strongly; some oppose growth in other types of public spending for fear that it will weaken the government’s ability to pay for the benefits that they believe they are owed.	许多人不仅强烈捍卫他们的权利，而且还反对其他方面公共支出的增加，因为他们担心这会削弱政府支付他们认为自己应得福利的能力。
These then are the roots of America fiscal impasse, which has produced passionate constituencies viscerally opposed to compromise.	这些就是美国财政僵局的根源，而财政僵局造成了选民发自内心的对妥协的强烈的反对。
Any political deal significantly before the debt-ceiling deadline would have exposed politicians to charges of betrayal from their constituents.	任何在债务上限最后期限前所达成的政治妥协都会让政客背上背叛选民的恶名。
And, given that President Barack Obama would ultimately be held responsible for a default, he needed the deal more than the Republicans did.	而一旦违约，最终负责的将是奥巴马政府，因此奥巴马比共和党更需要妥协。
So he had to coerce his party into accepting a deal full of spending cuts and devoid of tax increases.	于是，他必须强迫他所在的民主党接受只有支出削减、丝毫不见增税字样的方案。
Will the deal deliver what it promises?	最后的方案能够兑现承诺吗？
A bipartisan committee has to propose $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction by the end of this year, and Congress must either accept that proposal, or see immediate, politically painful expenditure cuts, which would include defense spending – an area that America’s Republicans care about strongly.	一个跨党派委员会必须拿出在今年年底前削减1.5万亿美元赤字的方案，国会要么接受这一方案，要么接受马上开始但在政治上极为痛苦的方案（其中包括防务支出削减，而这是美国共和党所强力捍卫的领域 ） ， 没有第三个选择。
If this structure works as advertised, Congress will be forced to reach a compromise, which can be sold once again by politicians to their polarized constituencies as being necessary to avoid a worse outcome.	如果这一结构如宣传的那样起效，那么国会必须达成妥协，而要达到妥协，政客就必须再一次说服两极分化的选民以避免更糟糕的结果。
This time, Obama’s Democrats will be on a level playing field, because both parties will be held equally responsible for a failure to reach a deal.	这一次，奥巴马的民主党将和共和党站在同一条起跑线上，因为如果不能达成一致，两大党派所要负的责任是一样的。
Ultimately, the big necessary decisions on curbing entitlement growth and reforming the tax code will probably have to wait until after the next election, giving the divided electorate an opportunity to reflect on its own inconsistency and send a clearer message.	最终，削减权利增长和改革税法所必须的重大决策可能不得不等到下一次选举之后才会做出，这给了意见相左的两派选民一次机会，反思自身阵营内部的不一致并给出清晰的信号。
In the meantime, US politicians might have done just about enough to convince debt markets that America’s credit is still good.	与此同时，美国政客或许能够勉强使债券市场相信美国信用亦然坚挺。
For that, Americans – and others around the world – should stop pillorying them and give them their due credit.	为此，美国和世界其他国家的人们应该停止攻击美国政府，给予他们应该给予的信用。
	
Was Killing Bin Laden a Mistake?	杀死本·拉登错了吗？
LONDON – “He lived a hero, he died a martyr...if they killed one Osama, a thousand others will be born,” says a comment on a Facebook group called “We are all Osama bin Laden.”	伦敦 — — Facebook网站上一个名叫“我们都是奥萨马·本·拉登”的组织称“他生为英雄，死为烈士…他们杀死一个奥萨马，一千个奥萨马会就此诞生 。 ”
The group was formed one hour after US President Barack Obama’s announcement of the Al Qaeda leader’s death.	该组织成立于美国总统巴拉克·奥巴马宣布基地组织领袖死讯后的短短一小时。
That Facebook group already has around 30,000 “likes.”	这家Facebook组织已经拥有约30，000名“追随者 ” 。
Moreover, there are more than 50 similar groups on Facebook.	此外，Facebook网站上类似的组织还有50多家。
Reaction to Bin Laden’s death on Al Jazeera and other Arabic news outlets has been mixed.	半岛电视台和其他阿拉伯新闻媒体对本·拉登之死反应复杂。
Some view the man considered a mass murderer in the West as an icon, and his death and burial at sea at the hands of American forces will not undermine that perception in the eyes of his sympathizers.	有人把这个西方人眼中的刽子手视为偶像，他死于美军之手并被海葬丝毫不会影响支持者对他的看法。
Indeed, Egypt’s former Mufti, Sheikh Nasr Farid Wasil, has already declared Bin Laden a martyr, “because he was killed by the hands of the enemy.”	实际上，埃及的前任穆夫提谢赫·纳斯尔·法里德·瓦西勒“因本·拉登死于敌手”已将他奉为烈士。
(Sheikh Wasil, it should be made known, has no links or known sympathies for Al Qaeda and he represents a very different Islamic school of thought.)	（值得一提的是，谢赫·瓦西勒此前与基地组织既无关系也不抱同情态度，他所代表的是一个完全不同的伊斯兰学派 ） 。
Aside from the mixed signals online, in the virtual world, the critical question is whether eliminating Bin Laden marks the beginning of Al Qaeda’s demise in reality.	抛开错综复杂的网络反应，虚拟世界的关键问题在于消灭本·拉登是否标志着基地组织开始毁灭。
Some terrorist organizations have, of course, collapsed following the death of their charismatic leader.	当然，有些恐怖组织在其超凡领袖死后逐渐土崩瓦解。
The case of Shoko Asahara, the founder of Aum Shinrikyo (the Japanese group that organized the Sarin gas attack on Tokyo’s subway in 1995), comes to mind here.	这不禁让人想起（组织1995年东京地铁沙林毒气袭击事件的日本组织）奥姆真理教创始人麻原彰晃。
But capturing and trying violent leaders is probably a better marker of the end of such organizations – the chances of such an outcome being higher when such leaders recant their views and call on their followers to lay down their arms.	但逮捕并审判暴力领袖也许是宣告组织终结的更好的方式 — — 如果该领导人宣布放弃自己的信仰并号召追随者放下武器，恐怖组织瓦解的可能性就会增大。
Abimael Guzmán, the leader of the Maoist Shining Path in Peru, and Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) in Turkey, are notable examples of this.	这方面的著名事例有秘鲁的毛派光辉道路领袖阿维马埃尔·古斯曼和土耳其库尔德工人党领袖阿卜杜拉•奥贾兰。
By contrast, far from causing the demise of an armed movement, the killing of a charismatic leader at the hands of his enemies can transform such a figure into a martyr.	相反，被神化的领袖死于敌手不但不能导致武装运动的解体，反而会使其上升到烈士的高度。
Che Guevera was far more valuable to leftist militancy after his death than he was while alive.	切·格瓦拉死后远比他在世时对左翼好战份子的价值更高。
Armed Islamism has its particularities, of course, but it also shares important characteristics with some of these groups, including the relationship between the physical elimination of a leader and organizational survival.	当然，伊斯兰教武装有其自身的独特性，但领袖肉体消灭和组织生存之间的关系等等重要特点与其他某些武装组织相通。
Decentralized organizations with relevant ideologies, operating in contexts full of conditions conducive to armed action, usually survive leadership losses, whereas hierarchical, cult-like organizations often do not.	在充满暴力诱因的环境中行动的具有相关意识形态的分散化组织通常能经受住失去领袖的打击，而等级森严的邪教组织则往往不能。
Since 9/11, Al Qaeda has been far from a hierarchical, cult-like organization.	自9/11事件后，基地组织已经与等级森严的邪教组织大相径庭。
Abu Musab al-Zaraqawi’s Al Qaeda offshoot in Iraq demonstrates this well: the group was called Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia for recruitment and propaganda purposes, but it was quite autonomous organizationally and operationally.	这一点在阿布·穆萨布·扎卡维的基地组织伊拉克海外分部问题上得到了充分的证明：该组织为方便招募和宣传起见在美索不达米亚对外自称为基地组织，但无论在机构还是运作方面都具有相当的自主性。
When Bin Laden’s close collaborator Ayman al-Zawahiri asked al-Zaraqawi to avoid targeting Shiites, al-Zaraqawi instead escalated the violence against them.	本·拉登的亲密合作者艾曼·扎瓦希里要求扎卡维不要袭击什叶派的时候，扎卡维反而加强了对什叶派的进攻。
Al Qaeda’s franchise model applies to Algeria, Yemen, North Mali, and Somalia as well.	基地组织的授权招募模式同样也适用于阿尔及利亚、也门、北马里和索马里等国。
And, like guerrilla movements of yore, Al Qaeda partakes of “ideological front” tactics: small urban cells and/or vulnerable individuals subscribe to the ideology and self-recruit or self-start an affiliated cell.	基地组织像很久以前的游击运动一样采用所谓的“思想战线”模式：由接受相关意识形态的城市小团体和/或脆弱个体自主招募或者成立附属机构。
In all of its decentralized modes of operation, Bin Laden mainly played the role of inspirational guide and iconic figurehead – a role better played when dead by American guns than alive, hiding from them.	在所有这些分散化的运作模式中，本·拉登主要担任负责引导和鼓舞人心的标志性代表人物 — — 死于美军之手比活着东躲西藏更有利于完成这样一项任务。
Consider Sayyid Qutb, the Islamist intellectual who influenced Bin Laden and others.	比如影响本·拉登和其他势力的伊斯兰知识分子赛义德·库特布。
Qutb was executed by Gamel Abdel Nasser’s dictatorship in Egypt in August 1966, in an attempt to reduce his influence.	为削弱其影响，库特布于1966年8月在埃及被加梅尔·纳赛尔的独裁政权执行死刑。
That tactic backfired badly.	这一举动产生了惊人的反作用。
Of the 98 fellow Muslim Brotherhood prisoners with whom Qutb discussed his new confrontational ideology in 1964, 35 were strongly supportive, 23 strongly opposed, and 50 hesitant.	在1964年与库特布讨论其全新对抗理念的共98名穆斯林兄弟会犯人中，35人强烈支持，23人坚决反对，其余50人举棋不定。
Despite his intellectual status and prestige, Qutb had failed to persuade the majority of like-minded inmates under conditions of repression.	尽管拥有知识份子的威望和地位，库特布仍然未能在高压环境下说服绝大多数与他志同道合的犯人。
But, no sooner was Qutb the intellectual executed than Qutb the grand martyr was born.	但就在知识分子库特布被处决之日，伟大的烈士库特布浴火重生。
His supporters soon numbered in the thousands, rather than the dozens, and he came to inspire generations, not just individual inmates.	他的支持者很快就从区区几十发展到数以千计，而受他鼓舞的也从几名囚犯发展到几代人。
Moreover, Qutb was executed by an Arab Nationalist Muslim leader, whereas Bin Laden was killed by US Navy Seals.	此外，库特布被阿拉伯民族主义穆斯林领袖处决，而杀死本·拉登的则是美国的海豹突击队。
That makes a significant difference in the Muslim world.	这在穆斯林世界中有着很大的不同。
Imprisonment, followed by recantation of violence, has become almost a trend in several jihadist groups, notably the 20,000-strong Egyptian Islamic Group, factions of the al-Jihad Organization in Egypt, and smaller groups like the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group.	遭到监禁后公开宣布放弃暴力，已近乎成为几个圣战组织，特别是拥有20，000多人的埃及伊斯兰组织、埃及圣战组织分部和利比亚伊斯兰战斗组织等小型组织的一种倾向。
Leading figures in armed Islamist movements have not only abandoned political violence, but have also de-legitimized it as a means for social and political change after spending periods in prison.	伊斯兰运动领导人不仅放弃政治暴力，而且在度过一段铁窗生涯后承认以暴力实现社会和政治变革为非法。
For example, Sayyid Imam al-Sharif (a.k.a. Dr. Fadl), an Al Qaeda ideologue for a decade, published several books denouncing armed activism, both theologically and on tactical grounds, after spending several years in prison.	比如在数十年时间里一直扮演基地组织理论家角色的赛义德·伊玛目·谢里夫被关押几年后就出版了几本在宗教和技术层面谴责激进武装的著作。
The same applies to the Islamic Group, a movement implicated in violent acts in almost a dozen countries throughout the 1980’s and 1990’s, including armed insurgency in Egypt, bombings in the United States and Croatia, assassination attempts in Ethiopia, and training camps in Afghanistan.	20世纪80到90年代曾牵涉到十几个国家的暴力活动（包括埃及的武装叛乱、美国和克罗地亚的炸弹爆炸、埃塞俄比亚的暗杀行动和阿富汗训练营）的好战组织伊斯兰集团也属于这种情况。
In the 2000’s, the imprisoned leadership of the Group produced more than 25 books aimed at de-legitimizing political violence as a method for change.	21世纪，该组织被监禁领袖出版了超过25本旨在谴责以政治暴力为变革手段的著作。
Eliminating the “spiritual guide” (as opposed to the organizational leaders) of a militant group might be perceived as a political victory for a government in the short term, but it probably makes a comprehensive de-radicalization process less likely, and it will not necessarily mean the end of the organization in question.	消灭好战组织的“精神领袖 ” （ 而不是组织首脑）可能被政府视为一种短期的政治胜利，但这也许会令全面的去激进化进程更加被动，而且也不一定就意味着这个恐怖组织的结束。
For long-term results, capture is almost always more effective than killing.	要想取得长期的效果，抓捕几乎总比杀死更为有效。
	
Wasting Food in a Hungry World	在饥饿的世界中浪费粮食
OTTAWA – One-quarter of all the food in the world is lost each year, owing to inefficient harvesting, inadequate storage, and wastage in the kitchen.	渥太华 — — 由于收割低效、仓储不足和厨房浪费，世界每年都有四分之一的粮食被白白浪费掉。
Halve that waste, and the world could feed an extra billion people – and make hunger yesterday’s problem.	如果能让浪费减半，世界可以额外养活10亿人 — — 让饥饿成为昨天的记忆。
The extent of food loss is particularly galling in view of a new global study on food security from the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization.	新发布的联合国粮农组织粮食安全全球研究显示粮食损失的程度是极其惊人的。
According to the FAO, 57 developing countries have failed to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of halving the proportion of hungry people by this year.	据联合国粮农组织统计，57个发展中国家未能实现今年饥饿人口比例减半的千年发展目标。
One in every nine people on the planet – 795 million in all – still goes to sleep hungry.	地球上有九分之一的人口 — — 总数高达7.95亿 — — 仍然每天饿着肚子睡觉。
Of course, there has also been remarkable progress: over the last 25 years, the world has fed an extra two billion people, and – for all the 57 failures – the developing world as a whole has almost halved its hunger rate.	其间当然也不乏显著的进步：过去25年里，世界多养活了20亿人口 — — 尽管有57个国家未能实现目标 — — 但发展中国家整体饥饿率已经下降了近一半左右。
But the challenge is to sustain the progress: by 2050, demand for food will have nearly doubled.	但难就难在要保持这种进展：到2050年，世界将出现接近翻番的粮食需求。
One reason is that by then the world will have added another two billion mouths to feed; a second reason will be the growing appetite of a surging new middle class.	原因之一是届时世界将额外增加20亿人需要供养；另一个原因是快速增长的新兴中产阶级胃口越来越高。
At the moment, the UN is considering 169 new development targets to succeed the Millennium Development Goals (hunger is one target area, among many).	目前，联合国正在考虑接替千年发展目标的169个全新发展目标（饥饿是其中一个目标领域 ） 。
These targets are vitally important, because they will determine how more than $2.5 trillion in development money is spent on everything from climate change to malaria.	这些目标极为重要，因为它们将决定超过2.5万亿美元的发展资金如何分配给从气候变化到疟疾等诸多发展目标。
My think tank, the Copenhagen Consensus Center, therefore asked 60 teams of top economists to assess which proposed targets will do the most good – and which will not.	我所在智库哥本哈根共识中心因此邀请由60位顶尖经济学家组成的团队来评估拟议中的哪些目标能发挥最大作用 — — 以及哪些发挥的作用较小。
Our research on food security shows that there are smart ways to feed many more on the planet – but they have little to do with the campaigns against waste seen in most of the rich world.	我们对粮食安全的研究显示有更明智的方式来养活地球上的更多人口 — — 但这与多数富裕国家开展的反浪费运动关系不大。
In the rich world, the focus is on food wasted by the consumer.	富裕国家重点关注被消费者浪费的食品。
This makes sense: more than half of the rich world’s losses take place in its kitchens (basically because we can afford it).	这样做是有道理的：富裕国家超过一半的损失来自于厨房（主要因为我们承受得了 ） 。
In Britain, for example, the greatest waste is in salads, vegetables, and fruits – luxuries when compared with the cheap calories contained in the grains and tubers consumed throughout the developing world.	比方说在英国，沙拉、蔬菜、水果等构成最大的浪费 — — 相比整个发展中世界所消费的谷物及薯类所含的廉价热量堪称奢华。
Smaller households in rich countries waste more per person, because it is harder to put everything to use, while richer households add waste when they can afford to buy extra “just to be on the safe side.”	富裕国家小家庭人均浪费更多，因为很难做到物尽其用，而富裕家庭“仅为安全起见”额外采购导致了浪费的增加。
By contrast, the world’s hungry poor waste very little, simply because they cannot afford to.	相比之下，世界上饥饿的穷人浪费非常之少，仅仅因为这样的浪费他们无法承受。
In Africa, daily food waste averages 500 calories per person – but consumers account for only 5% of this loss.	在非洲，餐厨垃圾每天人均浪费500卡路里的热量 — — 但消费者仅占上述浪费总额的5 % 。
More than three-quarters of the waste occurs well before the kitchen, in inefficient agriculture, because birds and rats eat crops during harvest, for example, or pests spoil grain stores.	超过四分之三的浪费发生在厨房之前，因为农业效率低下，收割期鸟类和老鼠偷吃农作物，或者粮食储备被害虫糟蹋。
There are many remedies for this kind of waste – from the “curing” of roots and tubers to minimize damage, to more expensive refrigeration.	此类浪费有诸多补救办法 — — 从腌制根茎以期减少损失，到更加昂贵的冷藏。
So why aren’t these technologies – widely used in richer countries – adopted in the developing world?	那么为什么这些在富裕国家被广泛采用的技术并没有运用到发展中国家？
The answer is a lack of infrastructure.	答案是基础设施的缺乏。
If there are no proper roads linking fields to markets, farmers cannot easily sell their surplus produce, which may then spoil before it can be eaten.	如果没有恰当的道路连接田头和市场，农民就不能轻松出售自己的剩余产品，以致于它们在被食用之前就可能腐败掉。
Improving road and rail capacity enables farmers to reach buyers – and fertilizer and other agricultural inputs to reach farmers.	改善公路及铁路运力使农民能够接触到购买者 — — 也有利于化肥和其他农业生产资料被运送到农民手中。
Supplying reliable electricity permits grains to be dried and vegetables to be kept cool.	可靠的电力供应确保谷物得到干燥、蔬菜得到冷藏。
Economists from the International Food Policy Research Institute estimate that the overall cost of approximately halving post-harvest losses in the developing world would be $239 billion over the next 15 years – and would generate benefits worth more than $3 trillion, or $13 of social benefits for every dollar spent.	国际粮食政策研究所的经济学家预测在发展中国家实现后收获期损失减半的总成本今后15年将达2，390亿美元 — — 但能带来超过3万亿美元（也就是1美元成本比13美元社会效益）的收入。
This would make food more affordable for the poor.	这样穷人就更能买得起食物。
By 2050, better infrastructure could mean that 57 million people – more than the current population of South Africa – would no longer be at risk of hunger, and that about four million children would no longer suffer from malnutrition.	到2050年，改建后的基础设施可能意味着5，700万人 — — 超过南非目前人口的总和 — — 将不再忍受饥饿，并且约400万儿童将摆脱营养不良。
Most of these gains would be in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the world’s most deprived regions.	世界最贫困的撒哈拉以南非洲和南亚地区将是最大的受益者。
But there is an even better investment.	但还有更好的投资方向。
We can achieve three times the economic benefits, and even larger reductions in the number of people at risk of hunger, if we focus on improving food production rather than just on preventing food losses.	如果着眼于提高粮食产量而非仅仅预防粮食损失，我们就可以实现三倍的经济效益，并进一步减少受饥饿威胁的人口数量。
Today, only $5 billion is spent annually on research to improve the seven major global food crops, and just one-tenth of that is targeted to help small farmers in Africa and Asia.	如今，每年只有50亿美元被用于研究改良全球七大主要粮食作物，这当中又仅有十分之一被用来定向帮助非洲和亚洲的小农。
Investing an extra $88 billion in agricultural research and development over the next 15 years would increase yields by an additional 0.4% each year.	未来15年在农业研发领域额外投入880亿美元能额外增加每年0.4%的产量。
That might not sound like very much, but the reduction in prices and improvements in food security would help almost everyone.	这听上去似乎微不足道，但粮价下降及粮食安全改善将为所有人带来好处。
It would be worth nearly $3 trillion in social good – yielding an enormous $34 of benefits for every dollar spent.	这能产生近3万亿美元的社会效益 — — 即单位美元投入能够带来34美元的巨额回报。
Hunger is a complex problem, exacerbated by financial pressures, volatile commodity prices, natural disasters, and civil wars.	饥饿的问题非常复杂，财政压力、商品价格波动、自然灾害和内战都会导致其恶化。
But we could take an enormous step toward winning the global campaign against malnutrition, simply by investing in improved infrastructure and in agricultural research and development.	但只要坚持对改善基础设施和农业研发投资，我们就可以在赢得全球反营养不良的战争中迈出重要的一步。
	
Water for All	全民水源
This month, water once again takes center stage at the Fourth World Water Forum in Mexico City.	水的问题再次成为本月在墨西哥城举行的第四届世界水资源论坛的中心议题。
It is an opportune moment: while much of the world’s attention has been fixed on issues of energy supply and security, hundreds of millions of people in the developing world continue to see the supply and security of fresh water as equally, if not more, important.	这是一个有利时机：虽然全球大多数人的注意力集中在能源供应和安全问题上，但发展中国家仍有数以亿计的人口同样关注（甚至更加重视）淡水的供应和保障问题。
Surveys undertaken by the World Bank in developing countries show that, when poor people are asked to name the three most important concerns they face, “good health” is always mentioned.	世界银行在发展中国家进行的调查显示，在要求贫穷人口说出他们面临的三大重要问题时，他们总是提到“健康 ” 。
And a key determinant of whether they will have good health or not is access to clean water.	而他们是否拥有健康的关键就在于能否获得清洁的用水。
More than a billion people around the world today do not.	目前，全世界10多亿人都无法得到清洁的用水。
As a result, they are increasingly vulnerable to poor health.	因此，他们的健康日益受到威胁。
The World Bank estimates that by 2035, as many as three billion people, almost all of them in developing countries, could live under conditions of severe water stress, especially if they happen to live in Africa, the Middle East, or South Asia.	世界银行估计，到2035年，多达30亿人可能在严重缺水的条件下生活，这些人几乎全部来自发展中国家，特别是非洲、中东或南亚。
This will cause obvious hardship, but it will also hold back the economic growth needed for millions of people to escape poverty.	这显然会带来苦难，还会阻碍经济发展，而发展正是成百上千万人摆脱贫困的关键。
In Latin America, about 15% of the population – roughly 76 million people – do not have access to safe water, and 116 million people do not have access to sanitation services.	在拉丁美洲，大约15%的人口—约7,600万人—无法得到安全的水源，而且有1.16亿人享受不到卫生服务。
The figures are worse in Africa and parts of Asia.	在非洲和亚洲部分地区，这个数字更大。
This is a situation that few people in rich countries face.	这种情况富裕国家的人民是不会遇到的。
Generally, these countries’ citizens enjoy services that provide for all water needs, from drinking to irrigation to sanitation.	一般说来，这些国家的公民可以享受一整套的供水服务，从饮用到灌溉到卫生设备。
In addition, other water-related issues, such as the risks posed by flooding, have been reduced to manageable levels.	此外，其他有关水的问题，如洪灾所造成的风险，已经降低到了可以控制的水平。
Rich industrial countries have invested early and heavily in water infrastructure, institutions, and management capacities.	富裕的工业国家很早就在水利基础设施、机构和管理能力方面投入大笔资金。
The result, beyond the health benefits for all, has been a proven record of economic growth; one only has to look at investment in hydropower to see the positive impact of water management projects on many economies.	除了给全民健康带来的好处外，另外一个结果是切切实实的经济发展。 人们只要看看在水力发电方面的投资，就能够看到水利管理项目对很多国家产生的积极影响。
Granted, rich countries have a certain advantage: they benefit from generally moderate climates, with regular rainfall and relatively low risks of drought and flooding.	诚然，富裕国家有一些优势：它们一般气候适宜，雨量均匀，并且干旱和洪涝风险相对较低。
Even so, they are not immune to water-related disasters, as Hurricane Katrina’s destruction of New Orleans taught us.	即便如此，它们也并非不受与水有关的灾害影响，飓风卡特里娜对新奥尔良的破坏就是我们得到的一个教训。
But the impact of such events on poor countries is much greater.	可是，诸如此类事件对贫穷国家的影响要大得多。
Extreme rainfall variations, floods, and droughts can have huge social and economic effects and result in the large-scale loss of life.	极端的雨量变化、洪灾和干旱可能产生巨大的社会和经济影响，并导致很多人丧生。
The Gulf coast of Mexico and Central American countries has repeatedly experienced such tragedies, with poor communities the most vulnerable and the least able to cope.	墨西哥湾沿岸和中美洲国家多次经历了这种悲剧，贫困地区受到的损害最为严重，而其应对危险的能力却最低。
Ethiopia and Yemen are equally stark examples.	埃塞俄比亚和也门同样是典型的例证。
Ethiopia’s development potential is closely tied to seasonal rains, so high rainfall variation, together with lack of infrastructure, has undermined growth and perpetuated poverty.	埃塞俄比亚的发展潜力与季节性降雨密切相关，因此，极大的雨量变化和基础设施缺乏已经阻碍了发展，造成了持久的贫困。
A single drought can cut growth potential by 10% over an extended period.	仅一次干旱就可能使发展能力在很长一段时期内降低10 % 。
Yemen, for its part, has no perennial surface water; its citizens depend entirely on rainfall, groundwater, and flash flooding.	而也门没有可供常年使用的地表水，其公民用水完全依靠降雨、地下水和急流。
To move forward, developing countries need new water infrastructure and better management.	为了向前发展，发展中国家需要新的水利基础设施和更好的管理。
Any approach must be tailored to the circumstances of each country and the needs of its people, but there is no fundamental constraint to designing water development investments that ensure that local communities and the environment gain tangible and early benefits.	必须针对各国的具体情况及人民需求采取适当的措施，但是，在确保当地社会和环境及早取得切实利益方面，发展中国家规划水利发展的投资并没有根本性的束缚。
In some countries, new water infrastructure may mean canals, pumping stations, and levees.	在一些国家，新的水利基础设施可能指运河、抽水站和防洪堤。
Still others might need deeper reservoirs, more modern filtration plants, or improved water transport schemes.	而另一些国家则可能需要深挖水库、改进滤水设备或完善输水计划。
These can all potentially be designed to improve and expand water supplies for power generation, irrigation, and household and industrial use, while providing security against droughts and protection from floods.	这些措施都可以改善和增加发电、灌溉和家庭及工业用水的供应，同时提供防旱和防洪保障。
The key to successful increased investment in water infrastructure is an equally increased investment in water institutions.	成功增加水利基础设施投资的关键是同时增加对水利机构的投资。
Badly managed infrastructure will do little to improve peoples’ health or support economic growth, so water development and water management must go hand in hand.	管理不善的基础设施对改善人们的健康或支持经济增长毫无益处，因此，水利开发和水利管理必须齐头并进。
Water infrastructure can and must be developed in parallel with sound institutions, good governance, great attention to the environment, and an equitable sharing of costs and benefits.	水利基础设施能够而且必须与完善的机构、良好的管理、对环境的关注以及公平分担管理成本、享受管理效益实现同步发展。
A water investment policy that reduces the vulnerability of the poor and offers basic water security for all will require customized planning and an effective partnership of donor countries, developing country governments, the private sector, and local communities.	减轻贫困人口脆弱性和提供全民基本用水保障的水务投资政策需要捐助国、发展中国家、私营部门和地方社会的合理规划和有效合作。
Delegates to the World Water Forum will have ample opportunity to forge and/or strengthen these partnerships.	参加世界水资源论坛的代表将有足够的机会建立和/或加强这种合作关系。
If they succeed, the rewards for the world’s poor will be immense.	如果合作成功，对世界贫困人口的回报将是巨大的。
	
War and Peace and Water	战争、和平与水资源
WASHINGTON, DC – India is currently facing its worst water crisis in years, with an estimated 330 million people – one-quarter of its population – affected by severe drought.	华盛顿 — — 印度正面临多年来最严重的水资源危机，约有3亿3000万人（占全国人口的1/4）面临严重干旱的影响。
Ethiopia is also dealing with its worst drought in decades, which has already contributed to the failure of many crops, creating food shortages that now affect around a tenth of the population.	埃塞俄比亚也面临着几十年来最严重的干旱，导致许多农作物歉收、由此造成的粮食短缺威胁着该国1/10左右的人口。
Under such circumstances, the risk of tension over resources is high.	在这样的情况下，为争夺资源造成局势紧张的危险性非常之高。
In the past, droughts of this severity have led to conflict and even wars between neighboring communities and states.	过去，如此程度的严重干旱曾导致临近社区与国家间爆发冲突乃至战争。
One of the first in recorded history erupted around 4,500 years ago, when the city-state of Lagash – nestled between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in modern-day Iraq – diverted water from its neighbor, Umma.	有记录历史以来的首次战争爆发于约4，500年前，当时位于现代伊拉克境内底格里斯和幼发拉底河之间的拉加什城邦曾想从其邻国乌玛引水。
Competition for water sparked violent incidents in ancient China and fueled political instability in Pharaonic Egypt.	古代中国曾因为争水引发了暴力事件，水资源短缺也在法老统治的古埃及助长了政治上的不稳定。
Today, actual wars between countries over water resources are uncommon, owing to improved dialogue and cross-border cooperation.	今天，因为争夺水资源而引发实际战争的情况已经十分罕见，因为对话和跨界合作的效率已经大幅提高。
But, within countries, competition for scarce water is becoming a more common source of instability and conflict, especially as climate change increases the severity and frequency of extreme weather events.	但在国家内部，争夺稀缺水资源正在成为动荡和冲突比较常见的来源，特别是当气候变化加剧了极端天气事件的频率和严重程度。
As we detail in our new report “High and Dry: Climate Change, Water and the Economy,” limited and erratic water availability reduces economic growth, induces migration, and ignites civil conflict, which fuels further potentially destabilizing migration.	正如我们在新报告“高纬度和干旱：气候变化、水资源和经济”中所提到的那样，有限和不稳定的水资源供应限制经济增长、诱发移民潮并导致内部冲突，而这又助长了可能进一步造成动荡的移民潮。
This cycle has been apparent in some regions for decades.	数十年来在某些地区这种循环已经显性化。
In Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, periods of low rainfall over the last 20 years have often been followed by spikes in violence, civil wars, and regime change.	例如在撒哈拉以南非洲地区，过去20年中降雨量稀少期过后往往伴随着内战、政权更迭和暴力活动抬头。
And in many parts of rural Africa and India, a decline in rainfall has acted as a “push factor” for internal or cross-border migration to more water-abundant places, often cities, creating new social pressures as the numbers of displaced people grow.	在非洲和印度农村的许多地区，降雨量下降已经成为向城市等水资源较为丰富地区展开内部或跨境移民的“推动因素 ” ， 而随着流离失所人数的不断增加，新的社会压力由此产生。
In our report, we predict that water scarcity could act as a conflict-risk multiplier, fueling cycles of resource-driven conflict, violence, and displacement, especially in already water-stressed regions, such as the Middle East and the Sahel in Africa, where agriculture remains an important source of employment.	在我们的报告中，我们预测水资源短缺有可能成为爆发冲突的风险乘数，进而推动由资源驱动的流离失所、暴力和冲突，尤其是在水资源已经紧缺的地区，例如中东地区和非洲萨赫勒。 在上述地区，重要的就业来源依然是农业。
Fortunately, there is a way to avoid the cycle of poverty, deprivation, and conflict.	幸运的是，避免贫困、匮乏和冲突的恶性循环我们并非束手无策。
If countries take action now to implement effective water-management policies and practices, backed by well-designed incentives, they can not only reverse the slide toward water scarcity, but also raise their rates of economic growth by as much as six percentage points per year.	如果各国现在采取措施实行有效的水资源管理政策及方法，再辅之以精心设计的激励机制，他们不仅可以扭转堕入水资源短缺的窘境，而且可以让经济增长每年加快6个百分点之多。
One water-scarce country that has taken action to improve its resilience to climate change is Morocco.	采取措施改善其气候变化适应性的一个水资源短缺的国家是摩洛哥。
In years of low rainfall, Morocco’s river-basin authorities give the lowest priority to crop irrigation, the largest consumer of the country’s water.	在降雨量不足的年份，摩洛哥的河流流域管理部门并未将重点放在其国内居首的耗水大户农作物灌溉上。
But, of course, agriculture remains critical to feed the population.	当然，农业依然是养活民众的关键所在。
So the government has been investing in modernizing irrigation infrastructure to provide farmers with more efficient water services that enable them to adjust more easily to variations in water availability.	因此政府坚持投资进行灌溉基础设施现代化建设，为农民提供高效的水资源服务，从而使他们能轻松适应水资源供应的变化。
The Moroccan authorities are also working to improve groundwater governance, to avoid over-extraction.	摩洛哥当局同时也在改善地下水治理以避免过度开采现象。
Farmers engaged in rain-fed agriculture receive support that helps them to make better use of rainfall – such as through the introduction of climate-resilient practices like direct seeding – resulting in higher yields than traditional practices produce during dry years.	采用雨水灌溉的农户能够得到支持，以帮助他们对降雨进行更好的利用 — — 例如通过引入直播等适应气候的先进方法 — — 采用上述方法后，干旱年份的产量能比采用传统方法出现显著的提高。
The message from Morocco – and from our report – is that, with smart water policies and interventions, countries can ensure a climate-resilient, water-secure future.	来自摩洛哥 — — 和我们报告 — — 的信息显示，借助明智的水资源政策和干预手段，各国能够保证实现适应气候变化的安全的水资源未来。
At the core of effective water-management strategies will be improved planning for water-resource allocation, the adoption of incentives to increase efficiency, investment in infrastructure for improved water security, and better urban planning, risk management, and citizen engagement.	有效水资源管理战略的核心是改善水资源分配规划、通过激励机制提高效率、投资改善水资源安全的基础设施、制定更为完善的城市规划、风险管理和民众参与机制。
The recently created International High-level Panel on Water, comprising ten heads of state, will be promoting precisely this agenda to foster better water management globally.	最近组建的由十国首脑组成的国际高级水资源委员会就是负责推进上述议程，并在全球范围内促进更完善的水资源管理办法。
Of course, not every country will follow the same path in safeguarding a water-secure future.	当然，每个国家在捍卫资源安全的未来时所走的道路各不相同。
But, as countries develop their strategies, they can look to one another for ideas and insights into what works – and what doesn’t.	但在各国制定本国战略的时候，他们可以相互参考哪些理念和见解能产生实际效果 — — 哪些不能。
With strong and prudent action, governments around the world can cope effectively with the natural limitations and uncertainties affecting water resources, ensuring that their people and economies are prepared for what might lie ahead.	世界各国政府可以采取谨慎有力的行动有效应对影响水资源安全的自然限制和不确定性，确保本国民众和国内经济为应对未来的形势做好准备。
	
Hard Wisdom for Scarce Water	稀缺的水的硬智慧
CAMBRIDGE – In California, residential consumers are being fined for wasting water.	剑桥—在加利福尼亚州，住宅消费者会因为浪费水而被罚款。
The goal is to combat a severe drought by reducing residential consumption by 20%.	这一规定的目标是通过将居民用水削减20%来对抗严重干旱。
The trouble is that residential water use accounts for less than 15% of total consumption.	麻烦在于居民用水只占总消费量的15%弱。
The rest is used mainly for agriculture.	其余用途主要是农业。
Even if the desired cuts are achieved, they will account for less than 3% of total demand – a drop in an otherwise empty bucket.	即使实现了预期的削减量，它们仍然只占总需求的不到3 % ， 只不过是杯水车薪罢了。
Meanwhile, in China, some 30,000 workers are trying to change the weather, attempting to seed clouds from airplanes or using anti-aircraft guns to shoot shells into the air, hoping to coax some rain from the sky.	与此同时，在中国，30,000名工人正在试图改变天气，实施飞机人工降雨或用高射机枪发射凝结核，以期从天上“骗”点雨水下来。
There is no statistical proof that this type of weather manipulation works, but cloud seeders are also busy in the United States, mainly in the west.	没有统计证据表明这种天气操控方式有效，但人工造雨者在美国特别是美国西部也是十分繁忙。
These pointless policies are what I have come to call “political placebos”: attempts by governments to demonstrate to their citizens that they are doing something – anything! – to alleviate water shortages.	这些无用政策我称之为“政治安慰剂 ” ： 政府采取措施向公民证明他们正在做些什么 — — 一切！ — — 缓和水短缺。
Placebos may have their place in medicine, but when they distract from efforts to address the underlying malady, they can do more harm than good.	安慰剂在医学中有用，但如果影响到根治病灶的努力，它们就弊大于利了。
Measures like those in California are like instructing police officers to blare their sirens wherever they drive to create the impression that crime is being fought.	加州采取这样的措施就好比是让警察在开警车时大鸣警笛以营造他们正在于犯罪活动斗争的印象。
As climate change leads to deeper and more frequent droughts, the resulting water shortages will require new, sometimes difficult, solutions that go beyond futile attempts to placate the public.	是气候变化引起了更深、更频繁的干旱，由此造成的水短缺需要可能相当困难的新解决方案，光是抚慰公众是不够的。
The challenges are daunting.	挑战十分艰巨。
In many places, underground water is considered the property of the owner of the land where the water is extracted, even when a well’s user is tapping an aquifer that spreads across thousands of square miles.	在许多地区，地下水被视为属于采水地土地拥有者的产权，尽管水井用户是在绵亘数千平方英里的含水层上打水。
As a result, there is little incentive to conserve.	结果是人们几乎没有动力保护地下水。
Meanwhile, widespread pumping lowers the level of the entire aquifer, potentially allowing salt water to encroach.	与此同时，大量钻井降低了整个含水层，可能导致盐水入侵。
And, because this arrangement is tied to property rights, only the bravest of politicians dare to address it.	此外，由于这一安排与产权挂钩，只有最勇敢的政客才敢于解决它。
In some parts of California and Texas, a portion of the water supply is provided to consumers for almost nothing – delivered by a network of dams, reservoirs, and aqueducts that were built decades ago.	在加州和德克萨斯州的一些地方，部分水以几乎免费的形式供应给消费者 — — 通过几十年前建造的水坝、水库和水渠供水。
The Hoover Dam, for example, which created Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the US, was built in 1936 during the Great Depression as part of the New Deal.	比如，胡佛大坝（Hoover Dam）创造了美国最大的水库米德湖（Lake Mead ） ， 它建于大萧条期间，是罗斯福新政的一部分。
Even if the federal government had intended to get a return on its investment by selling the water from Lake Mead, the dam’s construction costs have long since been amortized.	即使联邦政府曾经想通过出售米德湖水获得投资回报，大坝的建设成本也早已收回。
Unlike other commodities, the price of water is very often a political decision, subject to the influence of interest groups that lobby for subsidies.	与其他大宗商品不同，水价常常是一个政治决定，受补贴游说利益集团的影响。
For example, most of the water used in agriculture in Texas and California is sold at a price below its cost.	比如，德州和加州大部分农业用水以低于成本的价格出售。
As a result, it is frequently wasted.	结果是浪费现象严重。
The cost for an acre-foot of water in Dallas or Austin is at least $150.	在达拉斯和奥斯丁，一英亩尺（acre-foot）水的成本至少为150美元。
Texas rice farmers, however, pay just $10, and every year they consume the equivalent of a five-foot flood.	但德州稻农只需要付10美元，而他们每年消费的水量相当于一场5英尺高的洪水。
Such a large quantity of water is not even necessary for rice farming; most of it is used to drown weeds.	即使是种稻，也不必消耗如此大量的水；它们大部分被用来你淹死杂草了。
The US federal government needs to intervene in the water industry.	美国联邦政府需要干预水行业。
As long as these distortions persist, new technologies will struggle to compete.	只要这些扭曲状况存在，新技术就难以竞争。
Rationalizing the water sector would allow new investors to enter the market.	水部门的合理化将吸引新投资者进入市场。
Farmers in Texas and California need to stop growing rice, which should be imported from water-rich countries like Vietnam.	德州和加州农民需要停止种植水稻，而转为从越南等富水国家进口。
Instead, US farmers should be encouraged to shift to other crops, such as sesame, with the government sharing the cost of replacement machinery needed to cultivate and harvest them.	相反，美国应该鼓励农民转向芝麻等其他作物，由政府分担耕种和收获芝麻所需要的机器更换成本。
The adoption of technologies like drip irrigation would make current water use seem primitive and outdated.	滴管技术等科技的采用让当前的用水方式显得原始而陈旧。
The water sector should follow the example of the electric-power industry, where changes to federal regulations in the second half of the twentieth century allowed independent power producers to use existing transmission lines.	水部门应该效仿电力业的例子。 20世纪下半叶联邦电力监管改革允许独立发电商使用现有输电线路。
The deep price cuts and improved service ushered in by these regulatory changes prompted other countries to adopt the American model.	这些监管变化促使其他国家采取了美国模式，大减价和服务改善随之而来。
It is time to turn off the tap on subsidized water and find a real cure for persistent water shortages.	如今，我们应该关上补贴之水的龙头，为持久水短缺找到真正的药方。
	
Water as a Force for Peace	水，和平的力量
MUMBAI – The changing of the guard on the 38th floor of the United Nations building in New York, with António Guterres taking over for Ban Ki-moon as UN Secretary-General, has taken place at a time when notions about peace and conflict are undergoing a subtle change.	孟买 — — 纽约联合国大厦38层卫兵更换，以及安东尼奥·古特雷斯接替潘基文出任联合国秘书长，发生在一个和平与冲突理念正在发生微妙变化的时刻。
In particular, the role of resources – and especially water – is getting the recognition it deserves.	特别是资源 — — 尤其是水资源的作用，正在逐步得到应有的认可。
This has been a long time coming.	我们为这一刻已经等了很久。
Both Ban and his predecessor, Kofi Annan, have argued for some two decades that protecting and sharing natural resources, particularly water, is critical to peace and security.	潘基文及其前任科菲·安南二十年前就已经提出保护和共享自然资源 — — 尤其是水资源 — — 对和平和安全起到至关重要的作用。
But it was not until last November that the issue gained widespread acknowledgement, with Senegal – that month’s UN Security Council president – holding the UN’s first-ever official debate on water, peace, and security.	但直到去年11月这个问题才得到广泛认可，当月联合国安理会轮值主席国赛内加尔主持召开了联合国有史以来首次有关水资源、和平与安全问题的正式辩论。
Open to all UN member states, the debate brought together representatives of 69 governments, which together called for water to be transformed from a potential source of crisis into an instrument of peace and cooperation.	辩论向所有联合国成员国开放，汇集了69国政府代表，他们共同呼吁将水资源从潜在的危机来源转变为和平合作工具。
A few weeks later, Guterres appointed Amina Mohammed, a former Nigerian environment minister, as his deputy secretary-general.	几个星期后，古特雷斯任命前尼日利亚环境部长阿米娜·穆罕默德担任副秘书长职务。
The growing recognition of water’s strategic relevance reflects global developments.	全球进步体现在对水资源战略重要性的认识不断深入。
In the last three years, the Islamic State (ISIS) captured the Tabqa, Tishrin, Mosul, and Fallujah dams on the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers.	过去三年来，伊斯兰国（ISIS）夺取了底格里斯和幼发拉底河流域的泰巴盖、提歇利、摩苏尔和费卢杰水坝。
ISIS subsequently lost control of all of them, but not before using them to flood or starve downstream populations, to pressure them to surrender.	伊斯兰国不久后失去了对所有这些水坝的控制，但却在失控前成功地利用它们来淹没或者饿死下游人口，迫使他们投降。
Many analysts hope that ISIS will finally be eliminated from Iraq and Syria in the next few months.	许多分析家希望今后几个月能将伊斯兰国从伊拉克和叙利亚消灭掉。
But that does not mean that the group will disband; on the contrary, it may well relocate to the border areas between Libya and Chad, putting West African cities and water installations at risk.	但这并不意味着该团体会解散；恰恰相反，它可能迁移到利比亚和乍得边境地区，从而威胁到西非城市及其水利设施。
This tactic is not exclusive to ISIS.	并非只有伊斯兰国才使用这一策略。
Extremist groups in South Asia have also threatened to attack water infrastructure.	南亚极端势力团体同样威胁要袭击水利设施。
And of course state actors, too, can use water resources to gain a strategic advantage.	当然还有国家主体也可以利用水资源来夺取战略优势。
The importance of water in the twenty-first century – comparable to that of oil in the twentieth – can hardly be overstated.	21世纪水资源的重要性堪与二十世纪石油相媲美，其战略意义怎么强调都不为过。
Yet some strategic experts continue to underestimate it.	但某些战略专家却仍然对其予以低估。
The reality is that oil has alternatives like natural gas, wind, solar, and nuclear energy.	现实是石油具备像天然气、风能、太阳能和核能那样的替代品。
By contrast, for industry and agriculture as much as for drinking and sanitation, the only alternative to water, as former Slovenian President Danilo Türk once put it, is water.	而相比之下，就工业、农业、饮用和卫生等用途而言，就像斯洛文尼亚前总统达尼洛·蒂尔克曾经说过的那样，水资源的唯一替代品就是水资源。
The same is true for trade.	贸易的情况也同样如此。
Consider the Rio Chagres.	例如里约查格雷斯河。
While it may not be widely known, it is vitally important, as it feeds the Panama Canal, through which 50% of trade between Asia and the Americas flows.	虽然这条河可能不太出名，但却极其重要，因为它是巴拿马运河的水源，而巴拿马运河则承担着亚洲和美洲间50%的贸易运输任务。
There is no risk of the natural depletion of the river flow for the next hundred years, but, in the event of a security crisis in Central America, it could be taken over by rogue forces.	未来100年这条河没有自然干枯的危险，但如果中美地区爆发安全危机，它完全有可能被流氓势力所掌握。
The impact on the global economy would be enormous.	果真如此，对全球经济造成的影响将是巨大的。
The consensus on the need to protect water resources and installations in conflict zones is clear.	人们就保护冲突地区资源和水利设施所达成的共识是明确的。
What is less clear is how to do it.	不那么明确的是该怎么做。
Unlike medicines and food packets, water cannot be airdropped into conflict zones.	与药品和食品不同，无法通过空投的方式为冲突地区补水。
And UN Peacekeeping Forces are badly overstretched.	联合国维和部队保护水资源的力量严重不足。
The International Committee of the Red Cross does negotiate safe passage for technicians to inspect and repair damage to water pipes and storage systems in Iraq, Syria, and Ukraine; but each passage needs to be negotiated with governments in conflict and rebel commanders – a long and cumbersome process.	红十字国际委员会确实通过谈判为技术人员开辟安全通道，以检查和修复伊拉克、叙利亚和乌克兰等国被损坏的水管和储水系统；但��次通过都需要与冲突政府和叛军指挥官谈判 — — 这是一个漫长而又繁琐的过程。
A better approach would be for great powers, with their considerable influence, to negotiate short-term ceasefires in areas experiencing protracted conflict, specifically to repair and restore water systems.	更好的方法是由大国利用自身影响力在长期冲突地区谈判实现短期停火，特别是为修理和恢复供水系统。
To pave the way for such an approach, however, the UN Security Council will have to declare water a “strategic resource of humanity” and adopt a resolution to protect water resources and installations, similar to Resolution 2286, adopted last May to protect medical facilities in armed conflicts.	但要为这样的策略铺路，联合国安理会必须宣布水资源为“战略人道主义资源”并通过像去年五月保护武装冲突地区医疗设施的2286号决议那样的法案来保护水资源和供水设施。
In the longer term, countries that share riparian systems will need to establish regional security arrangements to preserve and protect their resources.	从长远看，共享河流体系的国家需要达成地区安全协议，对共有的水资源进行维持和保护。
With collaborative management underpinning collective protection, water, often a source of competition and conflict, could become a facilitator of peace and cooperation.	通过以合作管理为基础的集体保护，时常沦为竞争和冲突源泉的水资源就会对和平与合作发挥促进作用。
Denis Sassou-Nguesso, President of the Republic of the Congo, is at the forefront of this movement, by leading a group of eight governments toward the establishment of the Blue Fund for the Congo Basin.	刚果共和国总统德尼·萨苏-恩格索就处在水资源保护运动的前列，领导由八国政府组成的团体共同建立刚果盆地蓝色基金。
If successful, the Fund will help to mitigate climate change, create new avenues of river-based employment, and promote collective security in an unstable region.	如果他的努力取得成功，该基金将有助缓解气候变化、创造全新的河流就业岗位，并促进动荡地区的集体安全。
The Africa Action Summit in Marrakesh two months ago described the Fund as one of the four key ideas that can transform the continent.	两个月前马拉喀什举行的非洲行动峰会将该基金誉为能够改变非洲大陆的四大理念之一。
Last March, on World Water Day, Jordan’s Prince Hassan bin Talal and I called for the establishment of a Marshall Fund for the world’s shared river basins.	去年3月的世界水日，我和约旦哈桑·本·塔拉勒王子呼吁为全球共有的流域盆地建立马歇尔基金。
The Blue Fund for the Congo Basin is a step in that direction.	刚果盆地蓝色基金是向这个方向迈出的重要步骤。
Now, we need similar funds to emerge to protect all of the world’s 263 shared river basins and lakes.	现在我们需要成立类似的基金来保护全世界263个共有的流域盆地和湖泊。
It is a huge challenge; but, given the power of water to sow conflict and support peace, we must confront it head-on.	这是一个巨大的挑战；但鉴于水资源制造冲突和支撑和平的能力，我们必须勇敢地面对它。
	
Water Wars.	水资源之战
What is more vital for the future of humanity – and life in general – than water?	对于人类和所有生命形式的未来，还有什么比水更重要的呢？
Water abounds in nature, and most of humanity will have lived more than ten millenniums without ever wondering about it.	自然界的水资源十分丰富，大多数人即便再活一万年也不会认真考虑水的问题。
We draw it, use it, throw it away, most often back into rivers or oceans.	我们抽取水、利用水，再把废水排放到江河海洋。
But we could very soon end up not having enough of the fresh water that accounts for just 3% of all the water available on our planet.	但很快我们就会缺少淡水，因为淡水只占全球水资源总量的3 % 。
When one considers the fights we are capable of having over oil, one shudders to imagine where a lack of water could lead.	只要想一想石油会引发什么样的争斗，缺水所带来的灾难就会令人不寒而栗。
While Latin America seems well endowed, the situation is very different elsewhere.	尽管拉丁美洲的水资源比较丰富，但其它地方的情况却没有那么乐观。
Europe is nearing its limits, and water scarcity is already a pressing issue in Africa, Central Asia, and China.	欧洲正处在缺水的边缘，而水资源短缺的问题在非洲、中亚和中国已经迫在眉睫。
Over the last 20 or 30 years we have begun to comprehend what is at stake, owing to initiatives like the World Water Forum, which held its fourth annual meeting in March.	近二三十年来我们才开始意识到问题有多么严重，而这要归功于像世界水资源论坛这样的节水组织，该组织第四届年会今年3月刚刚召开。
Unfortunately, the Forum is not yet an official body and has no decision-making power.	遗憾的是，该论坛还算不上官方组织，也没有决策权。
But providing an arena for thought and debate has brought at least one huge benefit: greater awareness about water issues among the public and policymakers.	但它为思想和辩论提供的土壤至少有一项极大的好处：那就是使公众和决策者意识到水资源问题的严重性。
Water management is an inherently difficult challenge, and experience counts for a lot.	水资源管理注定是一项艰巨的挑战，经验在其中能起到很大的作用。
Practice shows that local levels of government provide the most efficient water management, even if regulations must necessarily be national in scope.	实践告诉我们：即使全国需要实行统一的节水政策，但由地方政府对水资源进行管理却最为有效。
But this is a division of labor that few national governments are ready to accept.	但在实际上，没有几个国家的政府愿意接受这样的分工。
Nor do most states seem prepared to start a real dialogue over water policy with civil society groups.	多数国家也没有做好准备就水资源政策与民间组织展开真正的对话。
At one extreme of exclusion, for example, consider that decisions about water management are largely taken by men, though in most of the world it is women who use the water.	举例来讲，一种极端状况是和水资源管理有关的决策都是由男人做出的，而在世界多数国家用水最多的却往往是女人。
Moreover, interference is constant, and inevitable, between the public and the private sectors. A subtle mix of official regulation and private contracting is required.	这还不算，公有和私有部门之间的相互影响长期存在，也不可避免，这就需要在官方管制和私人约定间达到微妙的平衡。
But not all jurisdictions respond in the same way.	但并非所有国家都采取了同样的对策。
The multiplicity of interlocutors inevitably creates a multiplicity of water systems with vastly unequal levels of efficiency.	谈判方的多种多样不可避免地导致了水资源管理系统的多种多样，而不同系统的管理效率也大不相同。
Initiatives like the World Water Forums thus inevitably highlight debates about what constitutes good water management, as well as elaborating useful concepts.	于是确定什么才是有效的水资源管理和宣传实用理念就成了像世界水资源论坛这样组织理所当然的工作重点。
One casualty of such debates has been the myth that water is free.	水资源没有成本的观点在这样的辩论中备受抨击。
Water has a cost, and someone, either end-users or taxpayers, has to pay it.	水资源有成本，不管是最终用户还是纳税人，反正水资源的成本需要有人来承担。
It is possible, of course, to envision sharing the costs, but it is no longer possible not to charge for water.	当然，我们可以用某种方式来分摊水资源成本，但免费用水却不再成为可能的选择。
The most recent World Water Forum debated two issues that will confront policymakers in the years ahead.	不久前举行的世界水资源论坛讨论了两个问题，这两个问题是决策者们在未来必须要面对的。
The first concerns the so-called “right to water.”	首先是所谓的“用水权利 ” 。
The urgency of the needs, with a billion people lacking access to drinking water and two billion without proper sewer systems, together with the vast number of diseases that result, underscore the need to recognize such a fundamental human right.	10亿人缺乏饮用水、20亿人缺乏合理的污水处理系统所带来的迫切需求，再加上随之而来的大量疾病，使这项基本人权的认定变得非常重要。
A consensus was reached at the Forum that such a right makes sense only if it is formulated in such a way that particular policymaking entities, be they water companies or local governments, face an affirmative duty to respect this right.	人们在论坛上达成一致，无论是自来水公司还是地方政府，只有当尊重这项权利成为特定决策机构的当然义务，这样的权利才有意义。
Only the state can be made responsible here.	只有国家才能承担这样的责任。
But the acknowledged responsibility of states in implementing the right to water cannot turn them into the sole paying authority.	但国家落实水资源权利的当然义务也并不意味着它们是唯一的出资机构。
The state must be charged with ensuring an effective water system that meets the basic needs of all, but the balance of this system remains to be defined.	国家必须出资建立能满足所有人基本需求的有效用水系统，但如何平衡这一系统还有待进一步研究。
These uncertainties, indeed, led the Forum to avoid acknowledging a formal right to water in its final resolution.	正是由于存在上述不确定之处，水资源权利才没有正式载入水资源论坛的最终决议。
The second issue concerned the role of local authorities.	第2个问题与地方政府有关。
Despite the political and administrative centralization of most of the countries represented at the Forum, there was widespread agreement that the most efficient water systems are managed as close as possible to the resource and its users.	尽管参加水资源论坛的多数国家都实行政治和行政集中管理，但人们都认可最有效的水资源管理方式要尽可能贴近源头与用户。
Agreement on this provided a real breakthrough for the future of water policy.	达成这样的一致使水资源政策在未来的突破成为可能。
Naturally, conflicts among governments or local authorities and private enterprises resurfaced.	于是，政府、地方管理机构和私有企业之间的矛盾自然而然再次成为关注的焦点。
Inevitably, the cruel lack of means was pointed out time and again.	于是，每个人都清醒地意识到我们在这个问题上束手无策。
And, unsurprisingly, the lack of solidarity among water haves and have-nots was openly on display at the Forum.	不仅如此，论坛也再次公开暴露了有水国和无水国之间的不团结。
As we grapple with our joint water future, we will face a time of trial and error in finding workable solutions.	在与共同的水资源未来抗争的同时，我们在寻找有效的解决方法时面临着严峻的考验。
But humanity already seems to be making more progress on matters related to drinking water than other global threats, such as climate change.	但与其它全球问题，比如气候变化相比，人类在与饮用水相关的问题上似乎已经取得了更大的进展。
We should all drink to that.	所有人都应该为此干杯。
	
Breakthrough Vaccines	突破疫苗
NEW YORK – Vaccines are one of the great success stories in the history of individual and public health.	纽约—疫苗是个人和公共健康史上最伟大的成功之一。
They have helped rid the planet of the scourge of smallpox, are poised to eliminate polio, and each year prevent millions of deaths, reducing the suffering and costs caused by infectious diseases.	它们帮助地球摆脱了天花，即将消灭脊髓灰质炎，并且每一年能挽救数百万人的生命，减轻传染病造成的痛苦和负担。
But there are still many diseases for which vaccines do not yet exist.	但仍有许多疾病我们没有疫苗可用。
Moreover, strategies that have previously led to the successful development of vaccines are unlikely to work against more complex bacteria or viruses, such as HIV, which have evolved multiple mechanisms to evade the immune system.	此外，早前带来成功疫苗开发的策略不再适用于更加复杂的细菌和病毒，比如可通过多种机制削弱免疫系统的艾滋病毒。
The history of vaccinology is one in which biomedical and technological advances usher in the “next generation” of vaccines.	疫苗学的历史是一部生物化学和技术进步带来“下一代”疫苗的历史。
In the 1950’s, a breakthrough that enabled viruses to grow in tissue cultures led to the development of both live attenuated vaccines and inactivated vaccines for measles, polio, and other diseases.	20世纪50年代，能让病毒在培养基中生长的突破带来了麻疹、脊髓灰质炎和其他疾病的减毒活疫苗和灭活疫苗的发展。
In the 1980’s, recombinant DNA technology led to the development of vaccines against hepatitis B and human papillomavirus.	20世纪80年代，DNA重组技术带来了乙肝和人乳头瘤病毒疫苗的发展。
Around the turn of the century, the first sequencing of the human genome led to “reverse vaccinology.”	在世纪之交，人类基因组的首次测序带来了“逆向疫苗学 ” （ reverse vaccinology ） 。
This approach, whereby computational analysis of a pathogen’s genome enables identification and screening of a great many more potential vaccine targets than was previously possible, was used in the successful development of a vaccine against meningitis B.	这一方法 — — 对病原体基因组进行计算机分析以识别和筛选潜在疫苗目标，数量之大远远超过了以前的可坑范围 — — 被用于乙脑疫苗的成功开发。
The past decade has already yielded major advances in structure-assisted vaccine discovery, synthetic biology, systems biology, and immune monitoring.	过去十年产生了结构辅助疫苗发现、合成生物学、系统生物学和免疫监测的巨大进步。
However, successfully translating these advances into the development of next-generation vaccines continues to be impeded by gaps in our understanding of the human immune response that protects against specific bacteria, viruses, or parasites.	但是，成功地将这些进步转化为下一代疫苗的开发仍受到我们关于人体对具体细菌、病毒和寄生虫的免疫反应的了解不足的制约。
That is why I, along with eight fellow scientists, have proposed the establishment of a new human-immunology-based clinical-research initiative, the Human Vaccines Project.	这就是我和其他八位科学家同事提出成立新的基于人体免疫学的临床研究计划 — — 人类疫苗工程（Human Vaccines Project）的原因。
In February 2014, leading scientists and public-health specialists will gather in La Jolla, California, to craft a scientific plan to identify, prioritize, and, most important, solve the major problems currently hindering development of vaccines against diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.	2014年2月，主要科学家和公共健康专家将齐聚加州拉荷亚（La Jolla）起草一份科学计划来对目前阻碍艾滋病、肺结核和疟疾等疾病的疫苗的开发的主要问题进行识别、决定优先顺序以及（最重要的）予以解决。
Such a project would represent a paradigm shift in vaccine development.	该工程代表疫苗开发的范式变化。
The current process is long (often spanning decades from concept to licensure), has a low probability of success (because of the limitations of animal models in predicting immune response and efficacy in humans), and is costly (often requiring hundreds of millions of dollars to develop a single vaccine).	当前的开发过程很长（从提出概念到获得许可要走几十年 ） 、 成功概率低（因为动物模型在预测人类免疫反应和效果方面作用有限 ） 、 而且成本高昂（通常一种疫苗的开发就要耗费几亿美元 ） 。
Consider this: In just the past few years, many candidate vaccines against HIV, dengue, herpes, tuberculosis, and staphylococcus aureus have failed, at a cost of more than $1 billion.	想一想：在过去几年中，许多候选HIV、登革热、疱疹、肺结核和金黄葡萄球菌疫苗遭遇了失败，超过10亿美元随之��流。
Investing that amount over the next decade in a coordinated effort to address the major questions facing vaccine development would rapidly accelerate our search for effective solutions, implying a transformative impact on individual and public health.	投资相同数量的资金用于在未来十年合作解决疫苗开发的所面临的主要问题能够大大加速我们对有效解决方案的搜索，给个人和公共健康带来变革性影响。
HIV presents perhaps the greatest challenge, because the virus leverages its extensive genetic variability to hide from the immune system.	HIV大概是最大的挑战，因为这种病毒利用其多种多样的遗传变异而不被免疫系统所识别。
Using recent advances, however, scientists have now identified highly conserved regions of this variable virus, determined their molecular structure, and begun designing next-generation vaccine candidates to elicit antibodies that target these regions to prevent HIV infection.	但是，如今科学家已可以利用最新的进步识别多变病毒的高度保守区（conserved region ） 、 确定它们的分子结构，并开始设计下一代候选疫苗以触发针对这些区域、防止HIV传染的抗体。
But HIV vaccine development, like that for several other diseases, is still impeded by the limitations of what animal models can tell us about how to elicit the necessary immune responses in humans.	但与其他几种疾病的疫苗一样，HIV疫苗的开发仍受制于动物模型对如何触发必须的人类免疫反应的预测力的局限性。
Two recent advances could accelerate vaccine development and reduce its costs dramatically.	两大最新进步有望加速疫苗开发、大大降低成本。
In synthetic biology, the rapid engineering of nucleic acid-based vaccines means more candidates move more quickly from concept to trial.	在合成生物学领域，基于核酸的疫苗的快速工程意味着更多的候选疫苗可以更快地从概念阶段进入试验阶段。
In systems biology, high-throughput technologies have increased the number of genetic and immunologic parameters assessed in trials.	在系统生物学领域，高通量技术增加了在试验中被评估的遗传和免疫参数的数量。
This approach has helped predict the efficacy of potential new-generation vaccines against yellow fever and influenza within days of immunization, compared with the usual timeframe of months or years.	这一方法有助于预测潜在的下一代黄热病和流感疫苗的有效力，只需几天的免疫期即可，而通常的时间框架是几个月甚至几年。
Vaccines already prevent the deaths of 2-3 million people every year, preempt human suffering, lighten the burden placed on health-care systems, and enable more rapid economic and social development.	疫苗每年能够挽救200—300万条生命，预防人类苦难，减轻医疗系统负担，并促进更快的经济和深灰发展。
Models show that adding even a partly effective AIDS vaccine to the current range of prevention and treatment procedures could dramatically lower the rate of HIV infection.	模型表明，即使是部分有效的艾滋病疫苗，如果用于当前预防和治疗过程，也可以大大降低HIV传染率。
As the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Desmond Tutu, one of the world’s great campaigners against HIV/AIDS, wrote recently: “We must make the most of scientific advances over the last half-century, which have made vaccines for other preventable diseases the most powerful and cost-effective health-care investment that currently exists.”	正如诺贝尔和平奖获得者、世界最著名的HIV/艾滋病斗士图图（Desmond Tutu）所说 ， “ 我们必须让过去半个世纪中的大部分科学进步 — — 这些进步已经形成了其他可预防疾病的疫苗 — — 成为目前所能找到的最有力、成本效率最高的健康投资 。 ”
That is the idea behind the Human Vaccines Project – a concept that would have been unimaginable even a decade ago.	这就是人类疫苗工程背后的思想 — — 这一概念在十年前还不可想象。
Today, technological advances in vaccine discovery and immune monitoring allow us realistically to explore this potentially game-changing approach to disease prevention.	如今，疫苗发现和免疫监测方面的技术进步让我们能够在实际中探索这一有望改变疾病预防局面的方法。
February’s gathering in California may take us a giant step closer to a world without deadly and debilitating infectious diseases.	2月的加州会议或许是我们迈向没有致死和致衰传染病的世界的一大步。
	
The G-20 to the Rescue?	G-20集团来救援？
BRISBANE – The G-20’s upcoming meeting in Brisbane, Australia, comes at a time when a precarious global economy requires big decisions to be made.	布里斯班 — — G-20会议即将在澳大利亚的布里斯班召开，恰逢此时，我们需要为拯救摇摇欲坠的全球经济做出重大决策。
But it is far from clear who will provide the decisive voice needed to set a bold agenda – and then shepherd its implementation.	但由谁来制定大胆的日程计划，并且指导计划的实施目前尚不清楚。
Economic data reveal that the global economy is shakier than at any time in the past two years.	经济数据显示全球经济比过去两年中的任何时候都更加不稳定。
Capitalism is struggling to generate adequate demand.	资本主义正竭力创造足够的需求。
Wealth and income have become increasingly concentrated, while middle-class incomes in the developed world have stagnated.	财富和收入越来越集中，而发达国家中产阶级的收入增长却陷入停滞状态。
Tax avoidance by multinational companies is draining developing-country incomes, limiting their ability to invest in education and infrastructure.	跨国公司的避税行为正快速榨干发展中国家的收入，令发展中国家无力投资于教育和基础设施建设。
And much more action is needed to address the largest and most urgent structural weakness of all – climate change.	需要采取进一步措施解决最大最紧迫的结构性弱点 — — 气候变化。
Many leading economists and policymakers are forecasting continued economic gloom.	众多著名经济学家和决策者都对持续经济发展做出了悲观的预测。
Stephen Roach has suggested that in the post-crisis global economy “relapse is the rule”; economist Brad DeLong, speaking of the “consequences of our lesser depression,” argues that the pretense of a eurozone recovery has collapsed; and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi has acknowledged the need not only for structural reform, but also fiscal expansion to boost aggregate demand.	史蒂芬·罗奇认为后危机时代全球经济“衰退才是王道 ” ； 经济学家布拉德·德隆则探讨“小规模衰退带来的后果 ” ， 并提出欧元区经济复苏的假象已经破灭；而欧洲央行行长德拉吉则承认不仅需要进行结构改革，还需要实施财政扩张以刺激总需求。
At the heart of their concerns is the lack of sustained demand needed to drive growth.	他们忧虑的核心是缺乏推动增长的持续性需求。
While structural reforms – particularly on the supply side – are required in developed and developing countries, they are not sufficient to address what former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers has called “secular stagnation” – that is, the difficulty of sustaining sufficient demand to permit normal levels of output.	虽然结构性改革 — — 尤其是供应改革在发达和发展中国家同样必要，但单纯的结构改革还不足以解决前任美国财长拉里·萨默斯所谓的“长期停滞” 问题 — — 也就是难以找到足够的需求允许产能正常释放。
The G-20’s central task, therefore, must be to establish a framework for strong and sustainable growth.	因此建设强劲的可持续发展框架理当是G-20峰会的核心任务。
Member states need to introduce reforms aimed at achieving a 2% annual growth target, as agreed earlier this year by finance ministers.	会员国需要像年初财长协议所要求的那样推进改革以确保实现每年2%的增长。
One structural reform that could drive global growth is substantial infrastructure investment in developing and developed countries alike.	在发达和发展中国家同时进行大规模基础设施投资是有能力推动全球增长的一项结构性改革。
Unfortunately, no G-20 leader has seriously articulated this need, let alone lobbied for a solution.	遗憾的是，没有哪位G-20领导人认真提出过这方面的需求，更不用说为解决方案进行游说了。
Apart from a World Bank presentation for a possible pilot infrastructure program, there is little to suggest how the 2% target could be met over the medium term.	除世行与试点基础设施项目有关的演示外，没有任何迹象表明如何在中期实现2%的增长目标。
G-20 governments, especially those with strong balance sheets, should be calling for large-scale public and private infrastructure investment to expand the productive capacity of member economies.	G-20成员国政府，特别是那些资产负债表相对强劲国家的政府，应当呼吁进行大规模公共及私人基础设施投资，以期在成员国经济内部实现产能扩张。
In the area of tax avoidance, discussion needs to broaden beyond developed economies; as the International Monetary Fund recently pointed out, developing economies’ budgets are disproportionately affected by multinational companies’ savvy accounting strategies.	避税方面的讨论不能仅局限在发达经济体；国际货币基金组织最近指出，发展中经济体的预算在极大程度上受到跨国公司精明会计策略的影响。
Unfortunately, judging by the initiatives already on the Brisbane agenda, the summit looks set to take a business-as-usual approach.	不幸的是，从布里斯班计划决定探讨的举措看，本届峰会仍将一切照旧。
If the G-20 fails to put policy meat on its rhetorical bones, it will risk looking weak and irrelevant.	如果G-20集团只是夸夸其谈而没有相应的政策出台，就会在世人面前显得脆弱且无关紧要。
Its very credibility is on the line.	人们会质疑它的可信度。
Indeed, some in the developed world would prefer a smaller, more exclusive body – a G-14 or even a new G-7.	事实上，发达国家某些人���要缩小20国集团到14国甚至7国。
Such a move would hurt the developing world, especially the Asia-Pacific region, including Australia.	这样的举措会伤害发展中国家，特别是亚太地区，包括澳大利亚。
One reason why some want a tighter group is that the G-20 struggles to achieve consensus.	某些人想要缩小决策圈的原因是G-20很难达成共识。
But this misses the point: It is harder to reach agreement precisely because all of the key leaders (representing around two-thirds of the world’s population and 80% of global GDP), whose support is needed for any truly global decision, are in the room.	但这种做法忽略了一点：即难以达成一致恰恰因为所有重要领导者（约占世界总人口的三分之二和全球GDP的80 % ） 都在场。 达成真正意义上的全球决策需要所有与会者。
The Brisbane Summit therefore needs to rediscover the activism that it displayed in 2008 and 2009, during the height of the financial crisis.	布里斯班峰会因此必须重新找到它曾在金融危机高潮的2008及2009年所表现出活跃度。
It must be led by the United States and other advanced economies, and backed up by major emerging economies.	布里斯班峰会必须由美国和其他发达经济体领导，同时得到主要新兴经济体的拥护。
Australia, as host, also has a role to play.	身为东道国的澳大利亚也必须发挥作用。
The country is respected by developed and developing countries alike, often bridging the interests of both, and is widely viewed as an honest broker.	澳大利亚深受发达及发展中国家的尊敬，往往会成为两者之间的利益桥梁，并广泛树立起诚实可靠的中间人形象。
Unfortunately, the current government has had little to say about the big structural problems that underlie the world’s economic malaise.	不幸的是，现政府绝少提及世界经济低迷背后的严重结构性问题。
The modest initiatives on the table reflect the government’s anti-public-sector rhetoric.	摆在桌面上的温和举措反应了政府反对公共部门的说辞。
Worse, as developed and developing countries are starting to take climate change seriously, Australia is moving in the opposite direction.	更遭的是，在发达和发展中国家开始认真对待气候变化问题时，澳大利亚却反其道而行之。
The Brisbane summit will be a crucial test for Australia, the G-20, and the possibility of truly global policy coordination.	布里斯班峰会是对澳大利亚、G-20集团和真正全球协调政策可能性的一次关键测试。
	
Weak America = Weakened Europe	一损俱损的美国与欧洲
America’s power has been so overwhelming for so long that many think it has survived George W. Bush’s presidency unscathed.	美国压倒性的威势已经保持得太久，以致许多人以为她在经历了乔治·W·布什执政的任期后还能毫发无损。
That this is untrue is demonstrated by those, from Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez to Iran’s Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe, who are exploiting America’s loss of standing and influence.	这种想法的错误性可以从那些利用美国声誉和影响力的削弱来大肆捞取利益的人身上可以看出来，从俄罗斯的弗拉基米尔·普京、委内瑞拉的雨果·查维斯，到伊朗的艾哈迈迪·内贾德和津巴布韦的罗伯特·穆加贝。
This is no cause for schadenfreude .	这可不是幸灾乐祸的时候。
On the contrary, it is high time for friends of the United States, particularly in Europe, to realize that America’s weakness undermines their international influence as well.	相反，美国的盟友，特别是欧洲，应该意识到，美国的衰落也会削弱他们自己的国际影响力。
The evidence of America’s weakness is clear enough.	美国衰落的迹象已经十分明显。
At the height of America’s power, Russia had resigned itself to the apparently unstoppable encroachment of NATO on the Soviet Union’s former sphere of influence.	在美国的威势达到巅峰的时期，北约对前苏联影响下的地区的蚕食似乎不可阻挡，俄罗斯只能黯然退避。
President Putin tolerated a US presence in Central Asia to assist in the campaign against the Taliban in Afghanistan and raised no serious objections when the US trashed the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty prohibiting strategic missile defenses.	美国进军中亚，参与打击阿富汗塔利班的行动，普京总统予以默许；美国撕毁限制战略性导弹防卫系统的“反弹道导弹条约 ” ， 他也没有提出严肃的抗议。
America, eager to bring both Ukraine and Georgia into NATO, felt scant need to consider Russian concerns, convinced that the Kremlin would have no choice but to bow to the inevitable.	美国急于将乌克兰和格鲁吉亚纳入北约时不觉得有必要考虑俄罗斯的想法，认为克里姆林宫面对必然的结果根本没有选择，只能接受现实。
That was yesterday.	时过境迁。
Today, Putin seeks to regain the influence Russia lost in previous years.	如今，普京正试图重新建立俄罗斯前几年失去的影响力。
He is skillfully playing the anti-America card across Europe while putting pressure on the Baltic states, a clear warning not to extend Nato any further.	他一边对波罗的海三国施加压力，明确警告北约不得继续扩张，一边在整个欧洲巧妙地打着反美牌。
In Ukraine, political forces resisting closer strategic links to the West have gained ground.	在乌克兰，反对与西方加强战略联系的政治力量已经站稳脚跟。
And the Kremlin is aggressively portraying the planned establishment of a modest US missile defense installation in Poland and the Czech Republic as a threat to Russia’s vital security interests.	克里姆林宫将美国在波兰和捷克共和国建立小型导弹防御基地的计划渲染成对俄罗斯重大安全利益的威胁，态度咄咄逼人。
Or consider Iran, another power exploiting American weakness.	再来看看伊朗，另一个利用美国的衰落获益的国家。
Only a few years ago, Iran’s government seemed sufficiently in awe of the US to inch toward an agreement on its nuclear program that would have interrupted, and perhaps even halted, its enrichment activities.	仅仅几年前，伊朗政府还看似对美国十分敬畏，一步步走向会打断、甚至终止其核浓缩活动的协议。
There was talk of possible bilateral contacts with the US, which, if successful, would have ended almost three decades of hostile relations.	传言他们会和美国进行双边接触，如果成功，就能结束近三十年的敌对关系。
Today, Iran’s enrichment program is going ahead despite the United Nations Security Council’s warnings of new sanctions, while Iranian officials publicly ridicule threats of US military action.	如今，伊朗不顾联合国安理会实施新一轮制裁的警告，执意推行核浓缩计划，伊朗的官员还公开嘲笑美国的军事威胁。
These examples reflect the same message: America is losing clout around the world.	这些例子反映了一个信息，即美国正在全球范围内失去影响力。
The Bush administration is internationally exposed in both the arrogance of its concepts and the limits of its power. It lacks support at home and respect abroad.	布什政府傲慢的观念和有限的实力暴露在全世界面前，于内缺乏支持，于外则得不到尊重。
Never since the US became the world’s predominant power during World War II has there been a similar decline in its international influence.	自从美国在二战中崛起，成为世界上的主导力量，其国际影响力还从未经历过类似的衰落。
Even during the Vietnam War and following its humiliating withdrawal from Southeast Asia, there was never any serious doubt about America’s authority and ability to deal with what was then the central strategic challenge, the Cold War.	即使在越战期间，以及从东南亚狼狈地撤退之后，人们也从未真正怀疑过美国应对冷战这个当时的核心战略挑战的权威和能力。
In today’s interdependent world, however, it is no longer the number of nuclear warheads that bestows influence, but a country’s ability to get others to go along with policies that it regards as serving its major interests.	然而，在今天这个互相依赖的世界上，影响力的来源不再是核弹头的数量，而是一个国家让他国追随她认为符合自己主要利益的政策的能力。
Bush’s America has forfeited that influence– in the Middle East, in Asia and Africa, and in much of Europe.	布什治下的美国丧失了这样的影响力 — — 在中东、亚洲和非洲，以及欧洲的大部分地区。
Many in the US like to think that this is a temporary state of affairs that will vanish with the election of a new president and Congress in 2008.	美国国内的许多人一厢情愿地认为这个势态只是暂时的，在2008年新的总统和国会选举之后就会烟消云散。
But they are neither sufficiently aware of the damage done nor realistic enough about the chances of Bush’s potential successors – many of whom initially supported his adventurism – to revive the trust and respect their country once enjoyed.	但他们要不是对已经造成的损害缺乏充分的认识，就是对布什潜在的继任者 — — 这些人当初大多支持他的冒险主义 — — 重获这个国家曾经享有的信任和尊重的机会认识不够清醒。
To achieve that will take more than a new face in the White House. It will require years of hard work to reconcile America’s resources and requirements, and to ensure that its initiatives can once again be seen as designed not to serve narrow US ideologies, but to advance a fair international order.	要实现这样的目标，仅靠白宫里换一张新面孔是不够的，还需要通过多年的努力，协调美国的资源和要求，并且让人们能够再次相信美国的行动是为了推进公平的国际秩序，而不是为狭隘的美国意识形态服务。
The result of protracted US weakness is also a weaker Europe.	美国长时间衰落将导致欧洲也会变弱。
In the heyday of American dominance, European governments profited doubly: they were part of a powerful West and courted as a potential counterweight to US dominance by third countries.	在美国优势地位的全盛期，欧���各国政府获得了双倍的利益：他们既是强大的西方社会的一分子，又被第三世界国家视为牵制美国的潜在势力。
If they dissented from US positions, this did not seriously impair the West’s strategic efficacy because American power was more than sufficient to compensate.	即便他们不附和美国的立场，也不会严重削弱西方的战略效力，因为美国的力量够强，完全能够弥补。
That arrangement no longer works.	这样的机制已不再起作用。
If European governments today distance themselves from America, as their citizens frequently demand, they will both antagonize and further weaken the US.	如果现在欧洲各国政府按照民众频繁的要求疏远美国， 会和美国对立起来，使美国进一步衰落。
At the same time, they will undermine their own international influence, allow others to play off Europe against America, destroying as well what chance remains for rebuilding the West with a reformed America.	同时，他们也会削弱自身的国际影响力，使其他势力在欧美的争斗中渔翁得利，还会断送通过改革后的美国重建西方社会的最后机会。
European leaders, even when they are unhappy over US positions, therefore need to combine forceful support for the transatlantic community of interests with discrete, if firm lobbying in Washington not to strain it to the breaking point.	因此，欧洲的领导人即便对美国不满，也应该联合起来，给予这个跨大西洋利益团体审慎的支持，如通过在华盛顿进行强大的游说攻势，告诉美国物极必反的道理。
Whether they can successfully perform this difficult act, remains to be seen.	他们是否能成功地完成这项困难重重的任务尚未可知。
Fortunately, Angela Merkel, Nicolas Sarkozy, and Gordon Brown understand the challenge, and at least some parts of the Bush government seem aware of the problem.	幸运的是，安格拉·默克尔、尼古拉·萨科奇和戈登·布朗明白这个挑战的重要性，而且布什政府中至少有一部分人已意识到了问题所在。
In the long period of American weakness, European leaders will have to demonstrate statesmanship for the West as a whole. It is a role for which decades of US supremacy have scarcely prepared them.	在美国长期的衰弱中，欧洲领导人将不得不表现出以整个西方为重的政治家才能，而这样的角色是在美国数十年的霸主地位下他们极少有机会担当的。
	
Trump’s Diminishing Power and Rising Rage	衰落的特朗普权力和高涨的愤怒
NEW YORK – The drama of Donald Trump’s presidency has centered around whether an extremist president would be able to carry out an extremist policy agenda against the will of the majority of Americans.	纽约—特朗普执政的闹剧的核心是一位走极端的总统是否可以违背大部分美国人的意愿，实施走极端的政策日程。
So far the answer has been no, and the midterm elections make it far less likely.	到目前为止，答案是否定的，中期选举让这种可能性更加降低了。
Yet Trump’s rising frustrations could push him over the edge psychologically, with potentially harrowing consequences for American democracy and the world.	但特朗普的日益失望可能导致他铤而走险，给美国的民主和全世界造成可怕的后果。
None of Trump’s extremist policy ideas has received public support.	特朗普的极端政策思想都没有受到公众支持。
The public opposed last year’s Republican-backed corporate tax cut, Trump’s effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), his proposed border wall with Mexico, the decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement, and the imposition of tariff increases on China, Europe, and others.	公众反对去年共和党支持的公司税减税计划、特朗普取消平价医疗法（奥巴马医保）的方案、退出伊朗核协定，以及提高对中国、欧洲和其他地区的关税。
At the same time, contrary to Trump’s relentless promotion of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), the public favors investments in renewable energy and remaining in the Paris climate agreement.	与此同时，与特朗普不遗余力地支持化石燃料（煤炭、石油和天然气）相反，公众更支持投资可再生能源以及留在巴黎气候协定中。
Trump has tried to implement his radical agenda using three approaches.	特朗普用三种方法实施他的激进日程。
The first has been to rely on the Republican majorities in the two houses of Congress to pass legislation in the face of strong popular opposition.	第一种方法是依靠共和党在国会两院的多数优势，不顾群众的强烈反对通过立法。
That approach succeeded once, with the 2017 corporate tax cut, because big Republican donors insisted on the measure, but it failed with Trump’s attempt to repeal Obamacare, as three Republican senators balked.	这种方法成果过一次，即2017年公司税学见计划，因为共和党的“金主”们坚持要采取这一措施；但在取消奥巴马医保的问题上它失败了，有三位共和党参议员投了反对票。
The second approach has been to use executive orders to circumvent Congress.	第二种方法是用行政令绕过国会。
Here the courts have repeatedly intervened, most recently within days of the election, when a federal district court halted work on the Keystone XL Pipeline, a project strongly opposed by environmentalists, on the grounds that the Trump administration had failed to present a “reasoned explanation” for its actions.	在这方面，法庭一再进行干预，最近一次是在选举前夕，联邦地区法院叫停了Keystone XL管道。 该项目受到环保主义者的强烈反对，因为特朗普政府没有为其行为作出“合理解释 ” 。
Trump repeatedly and dangerously oversteps his authority, and the courts keep pushing back.	特朗普一再地、危险地滥用权力，而法院一直在顽强阻击。
Trump’s third tactic has been to rally public opinion to his side.	特朗普的第三种伎俩是煽动民意支持他。
Yet, despite his frequent rallies, or perhaps because of them and their incendiary vulgarity, Trump’s disapproval rating has exceeded his approval rating since the earliest days of his administration.	但是，尽管他经常煽动民意，或者也许是因为这种煽动和它们的粗俗，特朗普政府自上台以来的反对率一致高于支持率。
His current overall disapproval rating is 54%, versus 40% approval, with strong approval from around 25% of the public.	目前，他的反对率是54 % ， 而支持率是40 % ， 强烈支持率只有25 % 。
There has been no sustained move in Trump’s direction.	特朗普从未获得过持续的支持。
In the midterm elections, which Trump himself described as a referendum on his presidency, the Democratic candidates for both the House and Senate vastly outpolled their Republican opponents.	在特朗普本人称之为对其总统地位的全民公投的中期选举中，众议院和参议院的民主党候选人都大胜他们的共和党对手。
In the House races, Democrats received 53,314,159 votes nationally, compared with 48,439,810 for Republicans.	在众议院，民主党获得全国53,314,159张选票，共和党只有48,439,810张。
In the Senate races, Democrats outpolled Republicans by 47,537,699 votes to 34,280,990.	在众议院，民主党以47,537,699票对34,280,990票领先。
Summing up votes by party for the three recent election cycles (2014, 2016, and 2018), Democratic Senate candidates outpolled Republican candidates by roughly 120 million to 100 million.	最近三个选举周期（2014、2016和2018年）合计，民主党参议院候选人以1.2亿张选票对1亿张选票领先共和党候选人。 尽管如此，共和党仍保持了参议院微弱多数。
Nonetheless, the Republicans hold a slight majority in the Senate, where each state is represented by two senators, regardless of the size of its population, because they tend to win their seats in less populous states, whereas Democrats prevail in the major coastal and Midwestern states.	每个州只能有两名参议员，不管其人口规模如何。 共和党赢得的席位往往来自人口较少的州，而民主党在主要沿海和中西部诸州胜出。
Wyoming, for example, elects two Republican senators to represent its nearly 580,000 residents, while California’s more than 39 million residents elect two Democratic senators.	比如，怀俄明州选出了两位共和党参议员来代表近580,000人，而有着3,900万人的加利福尼亚州，选择了两位民主党参议员。
Democrats win more votes, but Republicans win more seats.	民主党赢得了更多选票，但共和党赢得了更多席位。
Without control of the House, however, Trump will no longer be able to enact any unpopular legislation.	但失去了众议院控制权的特朗普，将无法实施任何不受欢迎的立法。
Only policies with bipartisan support will have a chance of passing both chambers.	只有得到跨党派支持的政策有机会通过参众两院。
On the economic front, Trump’s trade policies will become even less popular in the months ahead as the American economy cools from the “sugar high” of the corporate tax cut, as growing uncertainty about global trade policy hamstrings business investment, and as both the budget deficit and interest rates rise.	在经济方面，未来几个月的特朗普贸易政策支持率将会下降，因为美国经济已经从公司减税的“极乐”中冷静下来，而日益增加的全球贸易政策不确定性正在恶化商业投资，预算赤字和利率都在上升。
Trump’s phony national-security justifications for raising tariffs will also be challenged politically and perhaps in the courts.	特朗普为提高关税所提出的伪善的国家安全借口也会早到政治上，也许还有来自法院的挑战。
True, Trump will be able to continue appointing conservative federal judges and most likely win their confirmation in the Republican-majority Senate.	诚然，特朗普可以继续任命保守派联邦法官，并通过共和党占多数的参议院的批准。
And on issues of war and peace, Trump will operate with terrifyingly little oversight by Congress or the public, an affliction of the US political system since World War II.	而在战争与和平的问题上，特朗普将几乎完全不受国会或公众的监督，这正是二战以来美国政治体系的一大阵痛。
Trump, like his recent predecessors, will most likely keep America mired in wars in the Middle East and Africa, despite the lack of significant public understanding or support.	和他近期的前任们一样，特朗普很有可能让美国深陷于中东和非洲战事，哪怕群众根本不理解和支持这么做。
Nonetheless, there are three further reasons to believe that Trump’s hold on power will weaken significantly in the coming months.	尽管如此，还有三个理由认为特朗普对权力的把持在未来几个月中将被严重削弱。
First, Special Counsel Robert Mueller may very well document serious malfeasance by Trump, his family members, and/or his close advisers.	首先，特别检察官罗伯特·穆勒（Robert Mueller）会很好地记录特朗普、他的家庭成员和亲信幕僚的渎职行为。
Mueller kept a low profile in the run-up to the election.	穆勒在选举期间保持低调。
We will most likely hear from him soon.	我们可能很快就能从他口中听到些什么。
Second, the House Democrats will begin to investigate Trump’s taxes and personal business dealings, including through congressional subpoenas.	其次，众议院共和党将开始调查特朗普的税务和个人商业交易，包括通过国会传票手段。
There are strong reasons to believe that Trump has committed serious tax evasion (as the New York Times recently outlined) and has illegally enriched his family as president (a lawsuit that the courts have allowed to proceed alleges violations of the emoluments clause of the Constitution).	有很强的理由认为特朗普有严重的逃税行为（如《纽约时报》最近所列出的证据 ） ， 并利用总统职务之便为家庭谋取利益（一宗已经法院允许继续进行的诉讼指控他违反了宪法酬金条款 ） 。
Trump is likely to ignore or fight the subpoenas, setting the stage for a major political crisis.	特朗普可能会忽视或反击传票，导致重大政治危机。
Third, and most important, Trump is not merely an extremist politician.	第三也是最重要的是，特朗普不仅仅是一个走极端的政客。
He suffers from what author Ian Hughes has recently called “a disordered mind,” filled with hate, paranoia, and narcissism.	他患有伊恩·休斯（Ian Hughes）最近所谓的“心智失常 ” ， 脑子里充满了仇恨、偏执和自恋。
According to two close observers of Trump, the president’s grip on reality “will likely continue to diminish” in the face of growing political obstacles, investigations into his taxes and business dealings, Mueller’s findings, and an energized political opposition.	据特朗普的两位近距离观察者所言，面对日益严重的政治障碍、对税务和商业交易的调查、穆勒的发现，以及高涨的政治反对，总统对现实的把握“可能将进一步削弱 ” 。
We may already be seeing that in Trump’s erratic and aggressive behavior since the election.	我们可能已经通过特朗普自选举以来的反覆 和 好斗看到了这一点。
The coming months may be especially dangerous for America and the world.	未来几个月可能对美国和世界特别危险。
As Trump’s political position weakens and the obstacles facing him grow, his mental instability will pose an ever-greater danger.	随着特朗普的政治地位的削弱，并且所面临的障碍增强，他的心智不稳定将成为一个越来越大的威胁。
He could explode in rage, fire Mueller, and perhaps try to launch a war or claim emergency powers in order to restore his authority.	他可能爆发雷霆之怒，炒掉穆勒，甚至可能发动战争或宣布紧急状态来重塑权威。
We have not yet seen Trump in full fury, but may do so soon, as his room for maneuver continues to narrow.	我们尚未看到狂怒的特朗普，但也许很快就会了，因为他的施展空间在不断地缩小。
In that case, much will depend on the performance of America’s constitutional order.	果真如此的话，美国宪政秩序的表现将经受考验。
	
Europe’s German Ball and Chain	欧洲的德国桎梏
BRUSSELS – A storm-tossed ship near dangerous cliffs needs a strong anchor to avoid finishing on the rocks.	布鲁塞尔—在危险的悬崖边上遭遇风暴的船只需要强大的锚才能避免触礁。
In 2012, when a financial storm engulfed the eurozone, it was Germany that kept the European ship off the shoals of financial disaster.	2012年，一场金融风暴席卷欧元区，是德国让欧洲之穿免于驶入金融灾难。
But now Europe’s anchor has become a brake, hindering forward movement.	但如今，欧洲之锚变成了一个阻碍，阻碍欧洲的前进。
Of course, German Chancellor Angela Merkel acted in 2012 only when she could tell her domestic constituency that there was no alternative.	当然，2012年德国总理默克尔是在告诉国内选民已经别无选择之后才采取行动的。
But in the end, Merkel agreed to a permanent bailout fund for the eurozone.	但最终默克尔同意了永久性欧元区援助基金。
She also backed the formation of a banking union, which remains incomplete but still represents a key step toward a financial system supervised by the European Central Bank.	她还支持建立银行联盟，这一联盟目前仍未完成，但仍是迈向由欧洲央行承担监督责任的金融制度的重要一步。
Thanks to these measures, and ECB President Mario Draghi’s vow, which Germany tacitly approved, to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro, the financial storm abated.	有了这些措施，再加上欧洲央行行长德拉吉在德国默许的情况下承诺“不惜一切代价”拯救欧元，金融风暴消停了。
But now the eurozone seems incapable of escaping near-deflation, with little economic growth and prices barely moving upwards.	但如今，欧元区似乎无力摆脱接近通缩的状态，经济几乎没有增长，物价也没有表现出向上的趋势。
That was not supposed to happen.	本不应该如此。
When the crisis struck, the economies of the eurozone periphery were buffeted by the twin shocks of spiking risk premiums and a collapsing housing market.	当危机袭来时，欧元区外围经济体受到风险溢价飙升和房地产市场崩盘的双重打击。
At the same time, the German economy benefited from the return of capital fleeing the periphery.	与此同时，德国经济因为资本逃出外围的回流而受益。
Real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates in Germany became substantially negative, triggering a housing boom.	德国真实（经通胀调整）利率降到了远低于零的水平，引起了房地产泡沫。
It was assumed that this would generate strong domestic demand in Germany, helping the periphery to export more.	人们认为这会在德国形成强大的内需，有助于外围增加出口。
Instead, the German economy has barely grown; indeed, weaker world trade threatens to put it in recession.	相反，德国经济几无增长；事实上，国际贸易的走弱有可能导致德国陷入衰退。
The current-account surplus, which was supposed to decline sharply, has actually increased, as savings have remained higher – and investment lower – than expected.	被认为会暴跌的经常项目盈余实际上有所增加，因为储蓄保持比预期更高的水平（而投资保持着比预期更低的水平 ） 。
Another problem, at least from the point of view of the rest of the eurozone, is that inflation in Germany remains too low.	另一个问题 — — 至少从欧元区其他部分看来 — — 是德国的通胀水平仍然太低。
With German prices rising at less than 1% annually, the eurozone periphery needs falling prices in order to regain the competitiveness lost during the pre-2008 boom years.	德国物价每年升高不到1 % ， 这意味着欧元区外围需要价格下降才能重新获得2008年危机前的几年中所失去的竞争力。
This lack of dynamism at the core of the eurozone has now become its key problem.	欧元区核心活力不振已成为关键问题。
With no growth in Germany, the rest of the eurozone might not be able to reduce debt via external surpluses.	德国不增长，欧元区其他部分也许就无法通过外部盈余减少债务。
And there might be no solution short of a magic button to increase German domestic demand.	而要增加德国内需，目前看来似乎只能寄希望于魔术了。
Obviously, the German government is in charge of the country’s public finances.	显然，德国政府控制着德国的公共财政。
But fiscal policy has been roughly neutral in recent years, and thus cannot be blamed for the German economy’s lack of dynamism.	但财政政策在近几年中基本上保持中性，因此不能把德国经济缺少活力归咎于财政政策。
This year, the public-sector budget might move from a small deficit to what German officials call a “black zero” – a very small surplus.	今年，德国公共部门预算可能从略有赤字变为德国官方所谓的“零或略有盈余 ” （ black zero ） 。
But this tightening by a fraction of a percentage point of GDP implies no adverse effect on growth.	但这一相当于零点几个百分点GDP的紧缩对增长没有什么消极影响。
The root cause of Germany’s sluggish economic performance in recent years is the continuing unwillingness of its households and enterprises to consume and invest.	德国经济近几年表现呆滞的根源在于德国家庭和企业一直不愿消费和投资。
And it is difficult to see what the government can do about this.	我们也看不到政府可以就此做些什么。
Indeed, investment has fallen despite financing conditions for enterprises that have never been easier, both in terms of ultra-low interest rates and banks’ willingness to lend.	事实上，尽管企业的融资条件堪称史上最宽松（不管从超低的利率还是银行的放贷意愿看都是如此 ） ， 但投资仍在下降。
Yet Germany’s corporate sector remains reluctant to borrow and invest in the country, because it sees little reason to expect long-term economic growth, given that the population is set to decline and productivity gains remain anemic.	而德国公司部门仍不愿再国内借钱和投资，因为它们看不到长期经济增长的希望，这又是因为人口即将减少且生产率增长停滞不前。
With investment unlikely to become a motor for the German economy, consumption holds the key to stronger demand growth in Germany.	在投资不可能成为德国经济引擎的情况下，消费就成为提高德国内需的关键。
Its weakness is somewhat surprising: real incomes are up, and the coalition government that came to power last year has introduced a series of generous welfare measures, including a large increase in the minimum wage, a reduction of the retirement age, and a special top-up pension for women with children.	从某种程度上说，消费的疲软令人惊奇：真实收入水平在上升，去年上台的联合政府也引入了一系列慷慨的福利措施，包括大幅增加最低工资、降低退休年龄以及面向有孩妇女的特别追加养老金。
But even these measures, which foreign observers have largely overlooked, have failed to boost consumer demand.	但这些很少有外国观察者注意到的步骤也没能提振消费需求。
So what more could the German government do to wean the Germans off their abstemious habits?	那么，德国政府应该怎样做才能改变德国人节约的习惯？
Public investment is the one area where the government could act.	公共投资是政府可以有所作为的领域之一。
But the growth fillip from public-sector infrastructure spending can only be modest.	但来自公共部门基础设施投资的增长刺激将十分有限。
Increasing infrastructure spending by a quarter, which would represent a huge administrative effort, would lift GDP growth by just 0.4 percentage points.	将基础设施支出提高四分之一已是了不起的行政手笔，但只能让GDP增长提高0.4个百分点。
The main danger now is political.	现在的真正威胁是政治。
A weak German economy makes the necessary structural adjustments in the eurozone periphery much more difficult.	疲软的德国经济让欧元区外围所必须采取的结构性改革变得更加艰难了。
That, in turn, fuels the perception that responsibility lies with the German government, which is seen as unwilling to take the steps needed to strengthen domestic demand – even as it prohibits the periphery governments from spending more themselves.	这反过来强化了一种感觉，即德国政府需要对此负责，因为人们觉得它不愿采取必要措施强化内需 — — 即使它禁止外围国政府自己来增加支出。
As unemployment remains stubbornly high and incomes stagnate in much of the eurozone, the temptation to blame “the Germans” is becoming ever stronger.	欧元区大部失业率依然高企，而收入一直停滞不前，因此更有理由指责“德国人 ” 。
The German government, no surprise, does not even acknowledge that there is a problem.	毫不奇怪，德国政府甚至不承认有问题存在。
With unemployment remaining near record lows, the lack of demand growth is simply dismissed, and the absence of inflation is taken as a sign of success.	在失业率保持近乎历史最低水平的情况下，需求增长萎靡根本不受关注，而没有通胀也被视为是成功的象征。
This is a mistake.	这是一个错误。
Europe’s German anchor has become stuck, and the rising tide of anxiety among Germany’s partners should not leave its government indifferent.	欧洲的德国之锚被卡住了，而德国伙伴国日益上涨的焦虑之潮理应让德国政府无法坐视不理。
	
Weak Labor, Strong Securities Markets	弱小的劳工，强大的证券市场
A vital distinction between market economies is the degree to which ownership of large firms is separate from a firm's day-to-day management.	大公司的所有权与日常管理的分离程度是市场经济的重要特征。
What makes a company's owners willingly hand over control to professional managers?	是什么让公司的所有者自愿将权力移交给职业经理人？
That question is increasingly urgent as wealthy countries-as well as many transition and developing economies-attempt to create the robust securities markets needed to boost investment, productivity, and growth.	随着发达国家和发展中转型经济繁荣证券市场，促进投资、生产率和经济增长的努力，这个问题变得愈加紧迫。
Separation of ownership from management and effective securities markets reinforce each other.	所有权和管理权分离与有效的证券市场相辅相成。
The underlying theory is straightforward: if bosses can steal, distant owners will not buy shares.	潜在理论非常明显：如果老板可以窃取公司资产，外界股东就不会购买股票。
The formalistic civil-law systems that prevail in continental Europe supposedly provide inadequate protection, so ownership remains concentrated.	人们认为欧洲大陆现行的形式主义民法体系提供不了足够的保护，因此所有权仍旧掌握在少数人手中。
By contrast, Anglo Saxon common-law systems empower judges to interpret open-ended fiduciary rules on a case-by-case basis, thereby establishing legal precedents that are binding on managers.	与此相反，安格鲁萨克逊的普通法体系赋予法官按不同情况解释开放性信用规则的权力，并由此建立了约束公司经理的司法先例。
But this is a weak explanation.	但这种解释不够强大。
Before World War I, Europe's civil-law countries were developing securities markets as fast as the US and the UK.	一次大战前，欧洲民法国家证券市场的发展速度与美英两国相当。
Indeed, regulatory agencies like the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) arose because common-law fiduciary duties failed to protect distant owners.	的确，由于普通法的信用义务不能保护外界所有者，美国证券交易委员会（SEC）这样的监管机构才应运而生。
Insider trading, for example, was generally legal under the rules governing fiduciary duties in America's states, which back then played a dominant role.	比如内部交易在美国各州管理信用义务的法律中大多为合法，这在彼时彼刻占据了统治地位。
By contrast, the SEC is a rule-generating institution of the type that civil-law countries like France or Germany would have little difficulty creating if they wished to .	与此相反，如果法德这样的民法国家真想建立美国证交会这样的立法机构，也应该没有什么困难。
Moreover, fiduciary duties only aspire to prevent insiders from stealing. They do not control the main costs that shareholders face when they do not manage the company themselves, such as unprofitable expansion, shirking, retention of free cash flow, and empire building.	不仅如此，信用义务仅限于防止内部盗窃，而不能控制股东不亲自管理公司时面临的主要支出，包括非赢利性扩张、收缩、阻碍现金自由流动和创建独裁帝国。
Unless there is a conflict of interest between a company's management and its board, owners in common-law countries have no legal recourse when managers' operational or strategic decisions are bad, stupid, or otherwise harmful to shareholders.	除非公司管理层与董事会之间存在利益冲突，否则如果经理做出错误、愚蠢的经营或战略决策，或者伤害到股东利益的时候，普通法国家的所有者可谓求诉无门。
Throughout the rich world, institutions that raise the costs to shareholders of turning over control to professional managers play a powerful role in determining outcomes.	在整个财富世界，确定股东对职业经理权力移交成本的管理机构对最终结果起着非常重要的作用。
But these institutions reflect the political power of social forces, not the differences between civil-law and common-law systems.	但这些机构是社会力量政治权力的反映，而不能代表民法和普通法两种体系的分歧。
In particular, ownership separation in the wealthy continental European nations and the US can be linked with the role of labor inside the firm and within society.	具体地讲，富有的欧洲大陆国家和美国的所有权分离与公司和社会内部的劳工作用有密切的联系。
In some nations, labor greatly influences the firm through politics-i.e., opposing mass lay-offs and resisting restructuring plans that change the nature of the workplace.	在有些国家，劳工通过政治对公司产生很大影响¾即反对大规模裁员，抵制改变工作特性的重组方案。
Consider a simple scenario: a nation bars firms and owners from laying off employees for economic reasons. Faced with a no-fire rule, shareholders have reason to be very cautious: if expansion is not profitable, they cannot reduce labor costs.	想像一副简单的情景：国家禁止公司和所有者出于经济原因进行裁员，那么面对禁止解雇的规定，股东们有理由更小心谨慎：如果扩张不能盈利，他们就不能削减劳动力成本。
France, for example, is notorious for forcing foreign firms like Britain's Marks and Spencer to keep redundant workers on the payroll.	比如法国就因为强迫英国Marks and Spencer这样的外国企业保留富余劳力而臭名昭著。
Of course, no nation completely bans lay-offs, but flexibility varies greatly and can be central to profitability.	当然，没有国家完全禁止裁员，但灵活度却大相径庭，对盈利的作用也至关重要。
In a nation like the US, where employees can be fired easily, shareholders have less to fear.	在美国这样解雇劳工相对容易的国家，股东们就不太会害怕。
But in a labor-strong society, dominant shareholders-those with the most to lose if expansion goes awry-have reason to keep managers on a short leash.	但在劳动力相对强势的社会，那些如果扩张失误面临最惨重损失的主要股东，当然有理由捆住职业经理的手脚。
Italy's Fiat illustrates the problem: even a conservative government seeks to impede downsizing.	意大利的菲亚特对这个问题说明如下：即便是保守的政府也希望阻止裁员。
A second factor should also make owners want to stay close to the firm if labor is politically strong.	劳工取得政治强势的情况下，所有者希望保守经营还有另外一个因素。
Bargaining over the economic surplus is often open-ended, especially if competition is weak.	对经济盈利的讨价还价不受限制，在竞争较弱的情况下更是如此。
Where employees have high bargaining power, the profits pie is constantly up for re-division, both within the firm and at the national level.	哪里的员工讨价权利更大，那里的利润蛋糕就经常要重新分配，在公司和国家内部都是如此。
If managers are only loosely tied to shareholders, they could more willingly give up a bigger share of the pie to labor.	如果管理者与股东的联系不那么紧密，他们就可能乐意将更大的蛋糕分给劳动力。
Similarly, where shareholder interests do not come first, say, in a corporatist system, dominant owners have greater reason to keep financial information private, lest labor use it to press for more favorable terms.	与之相似，如果在组织体系中不优先考虑股东的利益，主要所有者��更有理由对财务信息严格保密，唯恐被劳动者利用，成为增加报酬的筹码。
Both considerations support concentrated ownership and work against securities markets.	这两种考虑都会导致所有权更加集中，对证券市场颇为不利。
So, where political and social values strongly favor labor, managers' loyalty to shareholder interests will be weaker.	因此，如果政治和社会价值观明显倾向于劳动力，经理对股东利益的忠诚度就会受到影响。
Managers in such "left" societies are no less technically capable, but their organizational constraints, incentives, and goals are less pro-shareholder.	如此"左倾"社会中的经理不仅在技术上能力受限，其组织约束、动机和目标也更少为股东考虑。
When forced to cut employment, they are more likely to think that they are destroying lives rather than raising economic efficiency and increasing wealth.	被迫裁减员工时，他们更倾向于认为是在摧残生命，而不是提高经济效益和增加财富。
Such societies should have fewer public firms, and narrower or no ownership separation.	这样的社会中上市公司的数量减少，很少或几乎不存在所有权的分离。
So they do.	情况的确如此。
The OECD has indexed how easy it is to fire an employee in member countries.	经合组织统计了各成员国裁员的难易程度。
Employees enjoy the least protection in the US, and a high degree of protection in Italy, France, and Germany.	美国对劳动力的保护最少，意大利、法国、德国保护程度较高。
The correlation with ownership separation is striking: a sample of the 20 largest firms in each country shows that, whereas 90% of the US companies have no shareholder with more than a 20% stake, none of the Italian, French, or German firms have such highly dispersed ownership.	统计结果与所有权分离的关系令人吃惊：对各国名列前20位大公司的抽样调查显示，90%的美国公司股东持股不超过20 % ， 而意、法、德三国都不具备这样高度分散的所有权体系。
True, with only 16 countries rich enough to be included in the survey, the correlation isn't perfect.	当然，由于仅有16个发达国家达到了调查标准，使得找到的联系并不精确。
The United Kingdom is in seventh place in terms of labor-market flexibility, but a higher proportion of its largest companies have widely dispersed ownership than sixth-place Switzerland-and double the share of fifth-place Denmark and fourth-place Australia.	在劳工市场灵活度方面英国排名第七位，但却比排名第六的瑞士有更多的国内大型公司分散所有权¾甚至达到了第五名丹麦和第四名澳大利亚的两倍。
But whatever measures of "political" qualities and ownership separation we use, the index of employment protection appears to be the best predictor of ownership separation in the wealthy West.	但无论采用何种"政治"性质和所有权分离手段，雇用保护指数似乎是富有西方国家所有权分离的最佳晴雨表。
More fundamentally, creating the regulatory institutions conducive to ownership separation may be impossible unless a society's political orientation towards labor and capital is more favorable to capital.	更为重要的是，除非社会对劳资双方的政治倾向更偏于资方，否则不可能建立起有利于所有权分离的管理机构。
	
The Failed State of Egypt?	失败之国埃及？
CAIRO – The aggrieved supporters of ousted Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi and the jubilant protesters who pushed the military to remove him have divided Egypt into two irreconcilable camps, both reflecting and reinforcing the country’s deeper problems.	开罗—愤愤不平的被推翻总统穆尔西的支持者和欢呼雀跃的促使军队推翻穆尔西的反对者形成了埃及不可调和的两大阵营，双方都反映并恶化着埃及深层次的问题。
Indeed, Egypt is now largely an ungovernable country that subsists on generous foreign handouts.	事实上，如今埃及已成为很大程度上不可治理的国家，只能靠慷慨的外国施舍过活。
Morsi never appreciated his tenuous position.	穆尔西从来不曾满意过自己脆弱的地位。
Though elected democratically, he chose to govern undemocratically.	尽管他是民选总统，却选择了不民主的治国方式。
He was bent on purging the judiciary and the public prosecutor’s office, claiming that they were aligned with the protesters opposing his government and their military backers, who had been overthrown in 2011.	他热衷于更换司法系统和公共检察官，声称他们与他的政府的反对者及其军队支持者（于2011年被打倒）沆瀣一气。
Morsi brooked little opposition in pushing through a controversial draft constitution.	穆尔西不能容忍对其所推行的保守主义宪法草案的反对。
In doing so, he neglected to focus on the structural problems that propelled a docile society to pour into the streets two and a half years ago to bring down his predecessor, Hosni Mubarak.	如此作风表明，他早已忘记了两年半前让温顺的埃及人民走上街头、推翻其前任穆巴拉克的结构性问题。
Just as damaging as Morsi’s governing style was the Muslim Brotherhood’s go-it-alone mentality.	与穆尔西的治国风格一样为害甚深的是穆斯林兄弟会的孤家寡人思维。
Decades of persecution have instilled in its leaders the belief that the world is aligned against them.	几十年的迫害史给穆兄会的领导人灌输了一个观念 — — 全世界勾结起来和他们作对。
Assuming power only stoked their paranoia.	掌权让他们的偏执狂思维愈演愈烈。
The Brotherhood’s leaders believed that the United States and Egypt’s elite were bent on ensuring their failure.	穆兄会领导人相信，美国和埃及精英处心积虑要使他们失败。
For this reason, they refused to reach out to their secular opponents to offer them a piece of the political pie.	因此，他们拒绝与世俗反对者接触，让他们也能从政治蛋糕上分一杯羹。
Even members of the more puritanical Islamist Nour Party were not invited to join the government.	即使是更严格恪守教规的伊斯兰光明党（Nour Party）也没有参与政府组建。
But it was not only Brotherhood politicians – inexperienced in the ways of democracy (and skeptical of them) – who stumbled.	但马失前蹄的并不只有对民主缺乏经验（也持怀疑态度的）穆兄会政客。
The debate in the US, long Egypt’s primary ally and donor, did not center on strengthening Egypt’s embattled institutions, but focused instead on how to ease the military out of power by withholding aid.	埃及长期盟友和赞助人美国国内的争论的核心并非强化埃及陷入重围的制度，而是如何通过撤除援助让军队交还权力。
Multilateral lenders like the International Monetary Fund were fixated on fiscal reforms such as reducing costly subsidies rather than shoring up a beleaguered economy.	IMF等多边贷款机构则关注减少埃及大规模补贴等财政改革，而不是巩固其四面楚歌的经济。
Today, a democratic transition that the West sought to portray as a model that other Arab nations could emulate lies in tatters.	如今，西方试图打造成其他阿拉伯国家应该效仿的民主转型已经轰然倒下。
Egypt’s economy, bruised by the outflow of foreign investment and a dearth of tourists, is on life support.	资本外流和游客锐减让埃及经济遭受重创，已在垂死挣扎。
Rebuilding the country will require much more than the cheering from the sidelines that Western countries have offered so far.	重建埃及所需要的远不只是对西方国家已经给出的援助欢呼雀跃。
Egypt has always relied on munificent benefactors to sustain its patchy state and economy.	埃及一直依靠慷慨的捐助维持其千疮百孔的国家和经济。
After the military coup in 1952, the Soviets provided much of the needed aid.	1952年军事政变后，苏联提供了大量所需援助。
Their “technical” experts turned the country’s second city, Alexandria, into a Russian country club.	苏联“技术”专家将埃及第二大城市亚历山大港变成了俄罗斯乡村俱乐部。
After Egypt pivoted to the West in the wake of the 1973 war against Israel, America became its main patron.	1973年对以战争结束后，埃及倒向西方，美国成为其主要金主。
But America’s ritual annual gift of roughly $1.5 billion could only dull the pain of Egypt’s problems, not resolve them.	但美国礼仪性的每年15亿美元左右的资助只能暂时止住埃及经济的痛苦，而不无法根除顽疾。
The country can no longer provide enough government stipends in the form of bureaucratic posts for college graduates.	国家已无力以官僚职位的形式给大学毕业生提供足够的政府津贴。
Egypt can only hope for cash infusions to offset its internal hemorrhaging.	埃及只能寄希望于注资抵消经济的内出血。
By making aid conditional on economic reform and democratic transition, however, the international community risks political triage.	但是，国际社会提出援助需以经济改革和民主转型为条件，这造成了政治混乱风险。
It should instead focus on financial assistance that blunts Egyptians’ frustrations and that contributes to building the institutions that will facilitate the transition toward democracy.	国际社会应该将注意力放在能减轻埃及人沮丧感、有助于建立促进民主转型的机构的金融援助。
But, of the $1.56 billion that the US State Department requested for Egypt in 2013, only $250 million is earmarked for non-military programs.	但是，在美国国务院许诺给埃及的15.6亿美元2013年援助中，只有2.5亿美元会用于非军事项目。
The US should increase funding for projects that focus on governance, civil society, and strengthening the rule of law.	美国应该增加对着重于治理、公民社会和强化法治精神的项目的融资。
Such programs receive a paltry $25 million in the 2013 budget.	这些项目的2013年预算只有区区2500万美元。
To bolster the economy, the US needs to shift its aid policies away from funding projects toward providing immediate budgetary relief.	为了提振埃及经济，美国需要将援助政策从提供项目资金转变为提供即刻预算纾困。
Though financing water-efficiency schemes certainly helps society, its effects are felt years after the aid is initially dispensed.	尽管为节水项目提供融资必然有助于社会，但其效果要在援助给出后好几年才能被��觉到。
The US, and other Western donors, should instead help Egypt to husband its resources, which are often misspent in an effort to placate its people.	美国和其他西方赞助者应该转而帮助埃及节省使用其资源，埃及常常为了安抚人民而滥用资源。
Egypt is the largest wheat importer in the world, and food subsidies account for approximately 2% of GDP.	埃及是世界最大的小麦进口国，食品补贴占了GDP的约2 % 。
To preserve its precious foreign-currency reserves, Egypt needs the US and its allies to provide foodstuffs.	为了保护其宝贵的外汇储备，埃及需要美国及其盟友提供食品。
Such a policy was adopted in the aftermath of the 1973 war, when America offered $200 million annually for wheat procurement.	这一政策市1973年战争后采用的，当时美国提供每年2亿美元的小麦采购量。
Embracing such policies will give institutions and the democratic process the time and space they need to plant firm roots.	采取这类政策将给埃及机构和民主进程时间和空间打下扎实基础。
Beyond such questions lies the fate of democracy in one of civilization’s most ancient lands.	除了这些问题，还有最古老文明之地的民主前途问题。
Whoever triumphs in future elections will lack the legitimacy that only a majority can provide.	不管在未来选举中谁能胜出，都将缺少只有多数人才能提供的合法性。
Such a majority spoke last year, when it elected Morsi.	去年，多数人的意见是选择穆尔西。
To strip him of his post negates a basic pillar of democracy and sets a dangerous precedent.	把他轰下台无异于毁掉了民主的一大支柱，也树立了危险的先例。
But, in a country that faces so many problems, the paradox of Morsi’s removal from power and the dilemmas of democracy that occasioned it are not among them.	但是，在这个面临如此之多问题的国家中，穆尔西被推翻的悖论和随之而来的民主两难并不在其中。
	
Preparing for the Unknown Unknowns	为未知的未知做好准备
LONDON – We live in perilous times.	伦敦—我们生活在危险的时代。
Just as we seem to get our bearings, something happens to make us feel as if our legs have been knocked out from under us.	就在我们似乎认清了形势时，机会发生一些事情，让我们觉得双腿被位于我们之下的东西弄瘫痪了。
Actions and events often are intertwined, and what happens on one level – affecting individuals, states, economic sectors, and companies of all sizes – may have repercussions on others.	行动和事件常常互相纠结，在某一层面所发生的事情 — — 影响个体、国家、经济部门和各个规模的公司 — — 可能会在其他层面引起反响。
The recent terrorist attacks in Paris are a case in point, affecting not only the families and friends of the victims, or even only the people of France.	最近在巴黎发生的恐怖袭击就是这样的例子，它影响的不只是受害者的家庭和朋友，甚至不只是法国人民。
The reverberations are being felt around the world, and they will continue to have an impact – far beyond Europe – on public policy, electoral politics, media freedom, and more.	反响在全世界都能体验到，并将继续给公共政策、选举政治、言论自由和其他方面造成影响 — — 并且远远不止于欧洲。
The attacks came at a time when the world traditionally tries to make sense of the year ahead – to forecast the risks that lie in wait, the opportunities that will arise, and the challenges that will have to be overcome.	袭击发生在全世界根据传统展望新年的时候 — — 也就是预测前方有何风险、有何机会、需要克服何种挑战的时候。
But what about longer-term risks?	但长期风险情况如何？
Do events like the Paris attacks show that forecasting them is impossible?	巴黎袭击这样的事件是否表明预测它们是不可能的任务？
Or did the attacks expose precisely the type of risk that long-term projections should identify?	或者，袭击是否暴露了长期预测应该看到的风险？
The World Economic Forum has just released its “Global Risks 2015” report which attempts to predict and rank the biggest risks that the world faces over the next ten years.	世界经济论坛刚刚发布了其《2015年全球风险 》 （ “Global Risks 2015 ” ） 报告，该报告试图预测未来十年世界所面临的最大风险并进行排序。
The WEF’s focus is squarely on the macro level.	世界经济论坛的注意力主要集中在宏观层面。
For example, “the biggest threat to the stability of the world in the next ten years comes from the risk of international conflict.”	比如 ， “ 未来十年世界稳定的最大威胁来自国际冲突的风险 。 ”
And the menace of war is followed by a raft of social, environmental, geopolitical, technological, and economic risks and trends.	而战争威胁排在许多社会、环境、地缘政治、技术和经济风险和趋势之前。
But all of these risks will be felt on an organizational, and ultimately, individual level as well.	但所有这些风险都可以在组织层面，并且最终在个体层面被感觉到。
That is why we spend time in conference rooms and around kitchen tables trying to identify and mitigate them.	正因如此，我们花时间在会议室和餐桌周围试图识别并遏制它们。
And yet we also know that the pace of change is faster than ever before, and that governments, businesses, and households are finding it increasingly difficult to keep up.	但我们也知道，变化的速度比以往任何时候到要快，而政府、企业和家庭日益感到难以跟上变化的脚步。
Beneath all of our identifying, quantifying, and mitigating of risk lies the undeniable and timeless truth that the only constant is change.	在我们所有的识别、量化和遏制风险努力之下时不可否认的永恒真理 — — 唯一不变的只有变化。
For Heraclitus, change was the fundamental principle of life.	对赫拉克利特来说，变化是生命的基本原理。
Machiavelli referred to it as fortuna:the events that shape us and determine our wellbeing are often beyond our reason and control.	马基雅维利称之为福尔图娜（fortuna ） ： 左右我们、决定我们福祉的事件往往超越我们的推理和控制。
Though we can attempt to plan for change, we cannot always predict the precise nature and time at which it will occur.	尽管我们可以尝试规划变化，但我们不可能永远预测到变化的性质和发生时间。
Moreover, for all the risks that we can and do plan for, it is those for which we cannot prepare that can do the most damage.	此外，对所有我们可以并作出规划的风险来说，我们无法做好准备的那些变化会带来最大的伤害。
That is why, alongside all of the identifying, quantifying, and mitigating, we must also embrace the idea that not all change can be clearly foreseen and planned for.	正因如此，除了所有的识别、量化和遏制工作之外，我们还必须接受一个思想，即并非所有变化都可以明确地预测和规划。
The implication is that we must instill in our families, organizations, and states the resilience and tools needed to act effectively in times of crisis – and thus to minimize the potentially damaging impact of unexpected change.	言下之意是我们必须潜移默化地在我们的家庭、组织和国家中建立有效应对危机时刻所需要的恢复力和工具，从而让意料外变化的潜在破坏力最小化。
This ethos will also help us maximize the potential benefits of such flux.	这一思想有助于我们实现这些波动的潜在收益最大化。
After all, without unforeseen change, much of human endeavor would be fruitless, and innovation would be unnecessary.	毕竟，没有未预见到的变化，人类的许多努力将无功而返，我们也没有创新的必要了。
Shocking things like the massacre at Charlie Hebdo in Paris happen, and they seem to be happening more frequently than ever.	类似于巴黎《查理周刊》大屠杀的冲击性事件时不时地发生，并且似乎比以往任何时候都发生得更加频繁。
They turn our world upside down and make us question our sense of who we are.	它们颠覆我们的世界，让我们质疑“我们是什么”的问题。
It is at such moments that we demonstrate our ability – or lack of it – to confront the unexplained, the unplanned, and the unfathomable.	这样的时刻正是我们证明我们面对无法解释的、计划外的、深不可测的能力 — — 或证明我们欠缺这种能力 — — 的时刻。
At the same time, such moments remind us that future generations ultimately will judge us not on the basis of what we accumulated – whether personally, as organizations, or as states – but by the impact we had on those around us, and by how well we responded to their needs.	与此同时，这样的时刻提醒我们，最终子孙后代对我们的评价基础不是我们积累了什么 — — 不管在个人、组织还是国家层面 — — 而是我们队周围人群的影响，以及我们如何响应他们的需要。
In perilous times, when the emergence, timing, and diffusion of risks can have a paralyzing effect, what matters is not simply what we accomplish, but how we accomplish it.	在危险的时代，当风险的出现、时机和扩散都可能造成瘫痪性后果时，重要的不仅是我们取得什么成就，而是我们如何取得成就。
In such times, the value we create cannot be measured only in terms of money.	在这样的时代，我们所创造的价值不能只用钱来衡量。
More important is how much stronger, more capable, and more resilient we help our colleagues, partners, children, and fellow citizens become.	更重要的是我们帮助同侪、伙伴、儿童和同胞变得多强壮、多有能力、多有韧性。
Perhaps the main risk this year – and in the decade ahead – is that we lose sight of this fundamental truth.	也许今年的主要风险 — — 以及未来十年的主要风险 — — 是我们没有看清根本事实。
	
Weimar Russia Revisited	重游魏玛俄国
The phrase “Weimar Russia” first appeared about 13 years ago, at the height of the confrontation between then President Boris Yeltsin and the Supreme Soviet that ended when Yeltsin’s tanks shelled the parliament.	“魏玛俄国”一词最早出现于13年前当时的鲍里斯·叶利钦（Boris Yeltsin）总统和最高苏维埃的高度对峙状态，后来叶利钦的坦克炮轰国会从而结束了最高苏维埃的存在。
The meaning was clear to all: Weimar Russia, like Weimar Germany, signified a weak republic attacked from within by nationalists yearning to restore authoritarian ways.	所有人都明白这个词的意义：魏玛俄国，和魏玛德国一样，表示一个软弱无力的共和国遭到那些渴望恢复独裁主义的民族主义分子的内部进攻。
In the late 1990’s and the early years of this decade, the problems that incited fears of a dysfunctional state seemed to fade.	上世纪九十年代后期和本世纪初，那些会引发人们对国家垮台的恐惧的问题看起来都消失了。
But over the past 18 months, the specter of Weimar has once again begun to haunt Russia.	但是在过去18个月中，魏玛幽灵再一次开始萦绕在俄罗斯人心头。
If taken to extremes, Russian society’s response to its wrenching modernization could degenerate into a nationalist revolution led by xenophobes.	俄罗斯社会对其痛苦的现代化的反应如果走极端的话，就可能会沦为一场惧外者领导的民族主义革命。
A different and healthy conservative response is possible if the tattered remnants of old threads, torn apart in the course of postcommunist modernization, can reconnect and grow together in a new way.	如果在后共产主义现代化事业中被扯得粉碎的破桐之叶能够以一种新的方式合而为一并一起生长，那么就有可能出现另外一种不同但却有利的保守的反应。
The problem is that everyone writes history in their own manner, and that there are no scales that can fix the precise point at which the remedy of unifying patriotism turns into the lethal poison of rabid nationalism.	问题在于，每个人对历史的看法各有不同，也没有尺度可以精确地测量出统一爱国主义的救药会在什么时候变成了致命的狂热民族主义毒药。
Weimar Germany blindly poisoned itself.	魏玛德国就是这样轻率地毒害了自己。
In the period from 1991 to 1993, nationalism was on the rise because Yeltsin’s infant democracy seemed weak, with the country in the throes of a deep economic crisis, as well as an acute confrontation between different branches of government.	从1991年到1993年期间，由于叶利钦尚处于婴儿阶段的民主体制还十分微弱，同时俄罗斯正痛苦挣扎于经济危机，面临政府内部不同派系之间的尖锐斗争，民族主义逐步抬头。
But what explains today’s resurgence of nationalism, when the regime and economy are strong, and all branches of government appear to operate in total unity?	但是当政权稳定，经济走势良好，政府内部派系也看起来团结如一体的时候，是什么引发了民族主义的复兴呢？
Indeed, there are no practical reasons for Russia’s current system of governance to fall into crisis (although such reasons may emerge in the event of an economic downturn).	事实上，俄罗斯现行的政治体系没有什么理由会陷入危机（尽管这种原因可能会在经济萎靡不振时候出现 ） 。
But there is another reason, no less important, that concerns morals and ideology.	但是还有另外一个同样很重要的理由，它涉及到道德和意识形态。
Challenges to established political authority have been chilled, fairly effectively, by means of state-sponsored patriotism.	国家发起的爱国主义运动十分有效地减少了对已建立的政治权威的挑战。
But the virus of nationalism has survived and multiplied.	但是民族主义的病毒却幸存下来并开始繁殖。
Opinion polls, for example, indicate that 50% of Russians support the slogan “Russia for Russians.”	例如，民意测验显示，50%的俄罗斯人支持“俄罗斯人的俄罗斯”口号。
Moreover, nationalism has spread from the streets into the elite.	此外，民族主义已经从平民阶层蔓延到精英阶层。
Nationalist statements that would have been confined to the extremist newspaper Den in the early 1990’s are now considered normal, “centrist,” even commonplace.	在上世纪九十年代早期只有在极端主义报纸 Den 上才看得到的民族主义言论现在被认为是十分正常 、 “ 中立 ” 、 甚至是普通的言论。
Today’s hardcore Russian nationalists consider Putin’s regime too soft, too pragmatic, too reasonable – in their language, “weak and indecisive.”	今天的俄罗斯民族主义的核心力量认为普京政府过于软弱，过于务实、过于理性 — — 用他们的话来说 ， “ 软弱而不果断 ” 。
They loathe it for its “surrender” in Ukraine to the “Orange Revolution,” and they condemn the decision to give land along Siberia’s Amur River to China.	他们憎恶普京政府，因为它在乌克兰向“橙色革命 ” “ 投降 ” ， 并且他们严厉谴责普京政府将西伯利亚阿穆尔河畔的土地给与中国的决定。
The “Putin Center” can be displaced.	“普京中心”有可能会被取代。
Recall that Russia’s pro-Western liberals, ascendant a decade ago, have been relegated to the ideological fringe, with the very word “democrat” (let alone “pro-West”) now a term of abuse.	回想起十多年前俄罗斯内地位优越的亲西方自由主义者，现在已经被人们用“民主人士 ” （ 更不用说“亲西方 ” ） — — 一个已经被滥用的术语称呼，被归到了意识形态的边缘。
Fortunately, there is no sign yet (not even on the horizon) of a charismatic leader capable of forging the scattered energies of national-socialist grievances into a critical mass of hatred and “national revival.”	幸运的是，把还没有什么（即使连已露端倪的都没有）迹象显示会出现一名极具魅力的领导人，能够将一盘散沙的民族社会主义分子愤愤不平的力量结合起来转化为一个充满仇恨的“民族复兴”团体。
Stalin’s ghost is no substitute for a real live leader; he will never leap out of his portraits, no matter how often they are waved.	斯大林的灵魂代替不了一个活生生的真正领导人，不管人们多少次向他的肖像挥手致意，他也不会跳出相片。
Moreover, times have changed.	此外，时代已经改变。
For example, no one even mentions the idea of introducing a dictatorship, abolishing elections, and so on.	例如，没有什么人会提及引入独裁政权、取消选举等想法。
No matter how harshly Russia’s “democrats” are abused, the word “democracy” remains a sacred cow.	不管俄罗斯的“民主人士”遭到如何苛刻尖锐的攻击 ， “ 民主”这个词仍然神圣不可侵犯。
Instead, a populist-nationalist revolution might resemble the attempt to overthrow Mikhail Gorbachev in August 1991, or a Russian version of Ukraine’s Orange Revolution.	事实上，一个平民-民族主义的革命也许就像1991年8月推翻米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫（Mikhail Gorbachev）的尝试一样，或者就是一个乌克兰橙色革命的俄罗斯版。
It might be some sort of “democratic nationalist revolution” – spontaneous, and not made by any one political party but by a popular mass movement.	它也许既是“民主主义”同时也是“民族主义”革命，不是由任何一个政党发起而是由群众运动引发的。
It would be anti-bureaucrat, anti-oligarch, anti-West, and staunchly pro-nationalist.	它将是反官僚、反寡头、反西方的，而且坚定地拥护民族主义。
These are the key ingredients in the nationalist stew that seems to appeal to Russians nowadays.	这些正是如今民族主义吸引俄罗斯人的的基本要点。
Judging by Putin’s most recent address to parliament, his regime is fully aware of the danger posed by populist nationalists.	从普京最近一次对国会发表的演讲判断，普京政府现在十分担忧平民主义民族分子引起的危险。
It is likely that the regime will attempt to counter this eruption of nationalism while maintaining its strong statist rhetoric.	政府很有可能会试图阻止民族主义爆发，同时维持中央集权下经济统治的论调。
But, in order to defeat the far right, Putin’s regime will be forced to take its stand on more or less liberal ideological grounds.	但是，为了打击极右翼分子，普京政府必须多多少少站在自由意识形态的立场上。
This won’t be easy for a regime based on the twin pillars of bureaucracy and the security apparatus.	这对一个建立在官僚主义和安全仪器两大支柱上的政权而言，可非易举。
What liberals should do in these circumstances is obvious: support Putin’s regime insofar as it maintains the foundation and institutions of a liberal order.	在这样的环境下自由主义者应该有何作为显而易见：只要普京政权保持自由秩序的基础和制度，自由主义这就应该支持普京。
The populist nationalists, because they reject these fundamentals, are the unremitting political antagonists of all liberals.	由于平民民族主义分子反对这些基本原则，因此他们是所有自由主义者永久的敌人。
Yet an alliance with the nationalists against Putin currently tempts many Russian liberals.	然而，一个由民族主义分子组成、反对普京的联盟还是吸引了许多俄罗斯自由主义者。
Indeed, the most popular tactic among liberals nowadays is to unite with all opponents of the regime.	实际上，如今最受自由主义者欢迎的战术是与政府所有的敌人团结一致。
That scheme is both absurd and dangerous.	这项计划荒谬且危险。
After all, the word “Weimar” draws its infamy from the pact with the devil that German conservatives and royalists made by backing Hitler.	毕竟 ， “ 魏玛”一词的恶名来源于那份德国保守派与皇室为支持希特勒而与恶魔签订的公约。
	
Welcome to the Era of Incompetence	欢迎进入执政无能的时代
Two diametrically opposed scenarios exist for what will happen to global real interest rates over the next generation.	对于未来二十五至三十年中全球实际利率的走向有两种截然不同的预测。
Those who predict generally low interest rates over the next generation point to rapid growth of productivity and potential output in the world economy.	认为低实际利率会主导未来二十五到三十年的人，其预测的依据是世界经济的生产率和潜在产能的快速增长。
According to this view, the principal problem faced by central banks will not be restraining demand as it shoots above potential, but boosting demand as it lags behind potential.	根据这种观点，各国央行将会面临的首要问题不是在需求超过产能时对其进行抑制，而是在需求滞后于产能时对其进行拉动。
They point to the fact that the world's major central banks - the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of Japan - have so firmly established their anti-inflation credibility that the inflation risk premium has been wrung out of interest rates.	他们指出，世界主要的中央银行-美联储、欧洲央行和日本银行-已经筑起了一道反通货膨胀坚固防线，从而将通货膨胀的风险差额从利率中挤出去了。
Believers in low interest rates also emphasize shifts in income distribution in the United States away from labor and toward capital, which have greatly boosted firms' resources to finance investment internally and reduced their dependence on capital markets.	相信低利率的人们还强调美国的收益分配从劳力向资本的转移。 这种转移已经极大地增强了企业内部融资的能力，从而减低了它们对资本市场的依赖程度。
They point to rapid technological progress, which has boosted output from new and old capital investments.	他们还指出急速的技术进步使得新旧资本投资的收益都有所增加。
With competition strong across the economy, they say that we can look forward to a generation of relatively high asset prices and relatively low real interest rates worldwide.	他们表示随着经济领域中竞争的强化，我们可以预见在未来的二十五至三十年中全世界范围内的较高资产价格和较低实际利率。
By contrast, those who predict generally high real interest rates over the next generation point to low savings rates in the US, high spending driven by demographic burdens in Europe, and feckless governments running chronic deficits and unsustainable fiscal policies.	相形之下，认为高实际利率会主导未来二十五到三十年的人则另有一套依据：美国的低储蓄率，欧洲在人口统计负担驱动下的高消费和政府在应对长期财政赤字和不可持续的财政政策方面的不力。
Imagine a bunch of irresponsible Bush-like administrations making fiscal policy, forever.	设想一下，要是永远让不负责任的布什政府之流来制定财政政策会出现什么样的结果。
They also cite investment opportunities in emerging markets, and make the obvious point that if China and India stay on track, their economies' relative weight in the world will double in the next decade or so, as rapid real growth is accompanied by appreciation in their real exchange rates.	他们还援引新兴市场的投资机会作为预测依据，并明确指出如果中国和印度沿着现有轨道发展，其经济总量在世界经济中的比重会在未来十年左右翻一番，因为货币的实际升值总是伴随着经济的实际快速增长。
Sooner or later, the Chinese and Indian central banks' desire to hold down exchange rates to boost exports and their rich citizens' desire to keep their money in accounts at Bank of America will be offset by the sheer magnitude of investment opportunities.	中国和印度的央行压低汇率以促进出口的愿望和其富有的国民将钱存入美洲银行的意愿迟早会被巨大的投资机会所抵消。
In this scenario, bond prices in post-industrial countries are heading for a serious fall - as are real estate prices in California, New York, and London.	在这种情况下，后工业化国家的债券价格会严重下跌-正如加州、纽约和伦敦的不动产价格下跌那样。
What, then, is an economist to do?	那么，经济学家们应该如何作为呢？ 我们可以仿效J.
One could emulate J.P. Morgan, whose standard response to questions about stock prices, bond prices, and interest rates was to say simply, "The market will fluctuate."	P. 摩根公司的做法，对股价、债券价格和利率方面的问题都只有一句标准的回应 ： " 市场会波动 。 "
Another alternative is to recall the late Rudi Dornbusch, who taught that any economist who forecasts interest rates based on fundamentals is a fool, because fundamentals are complex and unstable, shifting suddenly and substantially.	另一个选择是回忆已故的Rudi Dornbusch的教诲。 他教导我们说任何以基本的经济指标为依据预测利率的经济学家都是愚蠢的，因为基本的经济指标十分复杂并且变化无常。
Even if an economist correctly understands fundamentals, Dornbusch warned, that doesn't mean that markets do.	他警告说，即便经济学家对基本经济指标的理解正确也并不意味着市场对这些指标有同样的理解 。
In forecasting interest rates one is engaged not in examining fundamentals, but in predicting what average market opinion expects average market opinion about fundamentals to be.	在预测利率时，我们并不是要对基本的经济指标进行分析，而是预测市场对基本经济指标的变化会有怎样的判断。
But Rudi never followed his own advice.	但Rudi 从来也没有遵循自己的建议。
So let me place my bet - which I think is only 60% likely - and say that my best guess is that world real interest rates will be high over the next generation, and that current bond prices (and real estate prices) are not sustainable.	那么就让我来预测一下-我认为这一预测结果成为现实的可能性只有60 % - -我认为最大的可能性是全世界的利率在未来二十五到三十年会保持在较高的水平，且现有的债券价格（和不动产价格）是不可持续的。
Four features of modern politics in the world's post-industrial core lead me to this conclusion:	世界后工业核心国家的现代政治的四大特点让我得出了这一结论：
· In the US, the collapse of "grownup" Republicans in Congress - the extraordinary failure of fiscal conservatives to mount any effective opposition to the Bush administration's renewed destabilization of American government finances.	n 在美国 ， " 成熟的"共和党在国会倒台-财政保守派们面对布什政府重新扰乱美国财政居然束手无策。
The deficit orgy of the Reagan era is looking less like a freak political accident and more like a structural feature of Republican Party governance - what the modern Republican governing coalition tends to do whenever it gains power;	里根时代对财政赤字的放纵现在看起来越来越不像是一种古怪的政治事故而更像是共和党治理的结构性特点-现代共和党执政联盟只要大权在握就会这样做；
· The parallel collapse of a grownup Republican presence in the executive branch.	n 与前者并行的是成熟的共和党人在行政领域的失势。
As Ron Suskind reports in his recent biography of Bush's first Treasury Secretary, Paul O'Neill, former Bush Budget Director Mitch Daniels once whispered to himself at the end of a disastrous meeting, "Not a typical Republican package.	正如罗恩·萨斯凯德在最近为布什的第一任财政部长保罗·奥尼尔所著的传记中描述的那样，布什的前预算委员会主任米奇·丹尼尔斯在一次灾难性的会议结束后自言自语道 ： " 这不是典型的共和党的一揽子方案。
Definitely not."	绝对不是 。 "
But Daniels decided he would rather run for office in Indiana than take a stand in support of sound fiscal finance;	可丹尼尔斯宁可去竞选印第安那州州长也不愿出面支持一个合理的财政方案；
· The failure of Western European governments to even begin to think about how to address the coming fiscal crisis of the social-insurance state as a result of their aging populations;	n 西欧各国的政府甚至未能开始考虑如何应对人口老龄化即将给它们的社会保障国家带来的财政危机；
· The inability of Western European governments to enact sufficiently bold liberalizing reforms to create the possibility of full employment, together with the failure of western European monetary policy to be sufficiently stimulative to create the reality of full employment.	n 西欧各国的政府在制定足够大胆的自由化改革方案以创造充分就业的可能性方面的不力，再加上西欧温吞的货币政策在创造充分就业的现实方面的失败。
The arguments for low interest rates seem to me to require a degree of government competence that is unlikely, given political parties' current positions and the existing structure of the institutions that make fiscal policy.	在我看来，低利率的论点需要一定的政府执政能力来支持。 而就各政党目前的立场和财政政策的决策机构的现行结构来看，这种能力要求是不现实的。
I hope to be surprised.	我希望会有意外。
I hope to see governments in Western Europe and the US face up to their responsibilities and conduct sensible, sustainable fiscal policies.	我希望看到西欧和美国的政府勇敢面对它们的责任并贯彻明智、可持续的财政政策。
But that is my hope, not my forecast.	但这只是我的希望而不是我的预测。
	
Power to the Poorest	让穷人用上电
BREMEN – An estimated 1.2 billion people worldwide, including 550 million in Africa and 400 million in India, have no access to electricity.	不来梅 — — 全世界估计有12亿人，包括5.5亿非洲人和4亿印度人用不上电。
Most live in rural areas where the population is sparse and incomes are low, making it uneconomical to connect homes and businesses to a grid.	这些人大都生活在人口少、收入低的农村。 将农村家庭企业连入电网产生不了经济效益。
Nor is it feasible to generate power locally with a diesel unit, owing to high fuel costs and the need for substantial initial investment.	因为燃油价格高、初始投资大，在当地安装柴油机组发电也不可能。
A stable supply of affordable electricity is a prerequisite for economic development.	廉价而稳定的电力供应是经济发展的先决条件。
In fact, the consequences for people living without electricity can be dire: they may be deprived of adequate health care, or be unable to store fresh food.	事实上，没有电的后果也许非常可怕：人们可能无法享受充分的医疗保健，或者无法储存新鲜食物。
But one solution, based on the local use of renewable energy, requires minimal initial investment and can be expanded over time.	不过利用当地可再生能源的方案需要最低限度的初始投资，随着时间的流逝还可以逐步扩展。
This “boot-strap” approach is based on the use of photovoltaics – a simple, universal, and scalable technology that is easy to maintain.	这种“自给自足”的方法基于光伏技术的应用 — — 这是一种简单、普遍、容易维护和拓展的技术。
Typically, in the first stage of this process, consumers would use a renewable energy source such as LED lighting, selling any surplus until they save enough money to buy lamp oil (on which Africans spend around $20 billion annually).	通常过程的第一阶段消费者会使用一种可再生能源（如LED照明 ） ， 并将多余能源出售攒钱购买灯油（非洲人每年要花200亿美元购买灯油 ） 。
The additional revenue might initially come from selling small electricity surpluses to local farmers to recharge their mobile phones (thereby allowing them to work out the optimal prices for their crops), or to help them irrigate farmland using small electric pumps.	额外收入最初或许来自将很少的多余电量出售给当地农民给手机充电（这样他们就能将农作物卖到最优的价格 ） ， 或者帮他们用小型电泵灌溉农田。
This is a new opportunity.	这是一次全新的机会。
Until three or four years ago, photovoltaics were prohibitively expensive.	直到三、四年前，光伏发电还极其昂贵。
But advances in the industry and over-production have reduced their price by as much as 75%.	但行业进步和产能过剩使价格出现了高达75%的降幅。
The cheapest system, generating two watts of power, can cost as little as $10-20 and be expanded to almost any level, depending on the size and number of photovoltaic (PV) modules and the size of the battery storage unit.	能发两瓦电的最便宜的系统成本仅10-20美元，而且只要光伏（PV）模块的数量和电池存储单元的容量允许，可以拓展到几乎任何水平。
It is simple, too.	这种方法同样非常简单。
A residential solar-power system consists of just three components: the PV modules, a battery storage unit, and a charge controller.	住宅太阳能发电系统由光伏组件、电池存储单元和充电控制装置等三部分组成。
Such a system can supply low-voltage DC electric power at five volts for mobile phones, and 12V for LED lighting, pumps for outdoor use, and electrical appliances such as computers and televisions.	这样一套系统可以满足5V手机低压直流充电、以及12V LED照明、户外水泵及电脑电视等各式家电的用电需求。
When single-phase or three-phase 230V AC power is needed (say, to power larger machines), an inverter must be used.	当涉及单相或三相230V交流电（为大型机械供电时 ） ， 就必须用到变频装置。
This makes sense only for systems that are larger than a kilowatt of peak power and that have sufficient battery capacity.	变频装置仅适用于功率峰值大于1千瓦、且电池容量充足的系统。
Local systems in one building could be connected to local low-voltage DC or 230V AC grids to improve the security of supply.	建筑供电系统可以和当地低压直流或230V交流电网相连，以此来改善供电的安全性。
One major challenge to the boot-strap approach is developing cheap and durable batteries.	自给自足方案的难点在于研发出经济耐用的电池。
Many residential systems break down after 3-5 years when the battery dies, undermining confidence in the system among owners who assumed that they had a lifetime supply of energy.	3-5年后电池寿命终结导致很多住宅供电系��无法继续使用，大大影响了那些本以为可以终身供电的房主对于系统的信心。
But it is not a complicated process to demonstrate how to extend a battery’s life to as much as ten years.	但向房主说明将电池寿命延长至十年的方法其实并不是复杂的过程。
Indeed, getting the most out of a battery may require only that its owner fully charges it at least once every two weeks and never discharges it to less than 50% capacity.	事实上，尽可能延长电池寿命只需所有者至少每两星期将电充满，并且永远不要放电超过50 % 。
In addition, our own research team is currently exploring ways to rejuvenate old solar or car batteries – without requiring any chemical treatment or disassembly – for re-use in a residential solar-power system.	此外，我们自己的研究团队目前正在探索如何不进行任何化学处理或拆解即可恢复老旧太阳能或汽车电池 — — 用于住宅太阳能发电系统。
Once such technologies have been perfected, we can turn our attention to developing a boot-strap business model.	一旦这种技术得以完善，我们就可以集中开发自给自足的商业模式。
We believe that existing distribution, sales, and maintenance networks for other goods and services could be adapted to supply and provide customer support for solar-power systems as well.	我们相信可以对其他产品和服务的现有分销、销售和维护网络进行调整，令其为太阳能发电系统提供客户支持。
For example, bicycle mechanics, who are plentiful in Africa and rural India, or small shop and kiosk owners could be trained to install and maintain these systems.	比方说非洲和印度乡下都有不少自行车维修点、报摊和小商店，可以对店主进行培训，让他们学会安装并维护这些系统。
The combination of low-investment electricity generation for households and the ability to sell surpluses, scale up output, and access pre-existing distribution and maintenance networks bridges a crucial gap in the energy market.	低投资家庭发电、剩余电量出售、扩大产能和利用现有的分销及维修网络可以填补能源市场的重要空白。
It is a simple idea that would allow millions of people in poor, rural areas worldwide to integrate their activities with the wider economy, accumulate capital, and improve their lives.	这一简单理念能使世界各地成百上千万贫困的农村居民与全球经济接轨、积累资本并改善他们的生活。
	
Like the Palestinians, the Kurds Deserve a State	库尔德人理应跟巴勒斯坦人一样建国
JERUSALEM – Nowadays, almost everyone agrees that the Palestinian people deserve a state, and that they should not live under Israeli rule.	发自耶路撒冷 — — 如今几乎所有人都同意巴勒斯坦人应当建立自己的国家而非生活在以色列的统治之下。
Most Israelis share this view, including even Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has reluctantly stated his own commitment to a two-state solution.	大多数以色列人也赞同这一观点，甚至连总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡也不情愿地表达了自己对两国方案的承诺。
And in many Western democracies, a strong left-wing constituency regularly organizes demonstrations in favor of Palestinian independence.	而在许多西方民主国家，一批强大的左翼选民团体也会定期组织鼓吹巴勒斯坦独立的示威活动。
The argument for Palestinian statehood is anchored in a fundamentally moral claim for national self-determination.	巴勒斯坦建国的论据源自于一个关于民族自决的根本性道义主张。
Yet when it comes to securing the same right for the Kurdish people, the West has been shamefully and strangely silent.	但这一主张赋予库尔德人同样的权利时，西方世界却陷入了一片耻辱而诡异的沉默之中。
Western democracies offered no support for the Kurdistan Regional Government’s independence referendum in late September, and they have not spoken out against the Iraqi and Turkish governments’ threats to crush the KRG’s bid for statehood by force.	各西方民主国家既没有对9月底库尔德斯坦地区政府的独立公投给予支持，也没有站出来反对伊拉克和土耳其两国政府动武阻止库尔德人建国的威胁。
When officials in the European Union or the United States give a reason for opposing Kurdish independence, it always comes down to realpolitik.	在列举反对库尔德人独立的理由时，欧盟或美国官员总是会归结为现实政治。
Iraq’s territorial integrity must be preserved, we are told, and independence for the KRG could destabilize Turkey and Iran, owing to those countries’ sizeable Kurdish minorities.	他们说伊拉克的领土完整必须得到保护，而库尔德斯坦地区政府的独立还可能会破坏土耳其和伊朗的稳定，因为这两国也有着数量庞大的库尔德少数民族。
But these arguments merely underscore a double standard.	但这些论据只不过体现了他们的双重标准。
Moral claims for self-determination are justly raised in the case of the Palestinians, but they are entirely absent from the international discourse about Kurdistan.	巴勒斯坦人理直气壮地提出了民族自决的道义主张，却完全没有遭遇到那种针对库尔德斯坦的国际议论。
Worse still, the brutal oppression of the Kurds over many generations has been totally overlooked.	更糟糕的是，外界还无视了相关各国几十年来对库尔德人的残酷压迫。
In Iraq under Saddam Hussein, the Kurds were subjected to genocidal chemical-weapons attacks.	在萨达姆·侯赛因统治下的伊拉克，库尔德人受到种族灭绝式的化学武器袭击。
And in Turkey, the military has razed hundreds of Kurdish villages.	在土耳其，军方已经扫荡了数百个库尔德村庄。
Among the arguments used to deny the Kurds their right to self-determination, the defense of Iraq’s territorial integrity is the most spurious and hypocritical of all.	在否认库尔德人民族自决权的论点中，维护伊拉克领土完整的说法堪称是最荒谬虚伪的。
When British statesmen established Iraq as a distinct political entity after the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I, they did so in accordance with their own imperialist interests. Accordingly, they disregarded the territory’s history, geography, demography, and ethnic and religious diversity.	当英国政治家在一战击败奥斯曼帝国后将伊拉克建成一个独立政治实体时，他们遵循的只是自己的帝国主义利益，却忽视了这片土地上的历史，地理，人口以及种族和宗教多样性。
The residents of this newly conjured state were never actually asked if they wanted to live in a country with an overwhelming Shia majority and large Kurdish and Christian minorities.	当地民众被划入了这个凭空建立的新国家，却没有人问过他们是否想要住在一个什叶派穆斯林人口占压倒性多数同时却有着大量库尔德和基督教少数族裔的地方。
And they certainly were never asked if they wanted to be ruled by a Sunni dynasty that the British had implanted from the Hejaz, now a part of Saudi Arabia.	自然也没有人问过他们是否希望被一个逊尼派穆斯林王朝统治，而后者是当年由英国人从现为沙特阿拉伯一部分的汉志（Hejaz）地区移植过来的。
Initially, under the Treaty of Sèvres, which the defeated Ottoman Empire signed in August 1920, the Kurds, like the Armenians, were promised an independent state.	最初，根据战败的奥斯曼帝国在1920年8月签署的《西弗斯条约 》 ， 库尔德人像亚美尼亚人一样得到了独立建国的承诺。
But the victorious Allied powers later abandoned this promise, and the Kurdish people have lived under constant oppression ever since.	但获胜的协约国势力随后放弃了这一承诺，令库尔德人从此落入了长期遭各方压迫的命运。
In what became northern Iraq, the Kurds, like the country’s Assyrian Christians, were for decades denied recognition of their distinct language and culture by hegemonic Arab rulers in Baghdad.	在伊拉克北部地区，库尔德人就跟该国的亚述裔基督徒一样，长期无法得到巴格达的阿拉伯霸权统治者对自身独特语言和文化的认可。
In this context, “territorial integrity” is nothing more than an alibi for ethnic or religious oppression.	在这方面“领土完整”只不过是种族或宗教压迫的托词罢了。
Similarly, the tens of millions of Kurds living in Turkey and Iran have also long been denied basic human and cultural rights.	同样，生活在土耳其和伊朗的数千万库尔德人也被长期剥夺了基本的人权和文化权利。
It is thus understandable that the Turkish and Iranian governments would object to the KRG’s independence bid: they fear the emergence, if it succeeds, of similar movements among their own oppressed Kurdish populations.	因此也可以理解土耳其和伊朗政府为何会反对库尔德斯坦地区政府的独立尝试：他们担心一旦库尔德斯坦成功独立，自己手下那些被压迫的库尔德人也会群起仿效。
But the prospect of an independent Palestine destabilizing Jordan is never offered as an argument against Palestinian statehood, and nor should such an argument be used against Iraq’s Kurds.	然而却从来没有人用巴勒斯坦独立会破坏约旦稳定的说法来反对巴勒斯坦建国，因此这种观点也不应被施加在伊拉克库尔德人身上。
Moreover, the KRG has already established a relatively open and pluralistic society.	此外，库尔德斯坦地区政府已经建立起一个相对开放和多元化的社会。
As a semi-autonomous region, Iraqi Kurdistan operates under a multi-party system the likes of which one will not find in neighboring Arab countries, let alone in Iran or Turkey, which is increasingly turning toward authoritarianism.	作为一个半自治地区，伊拉克库尔德斯坦以多党制体制运作，这种制度在邻近的阿拉伯国家可看不到，更别提逐渐转向威权主义的伊朗或土耳其了。
National self-determination is a universal right that should not be denied to populations suffering under oppressive non-democratic regimes.	民族自决是一个普世权利，也是那些惨遭非民主政权压迫的人民理应享有的权利。
The same arguments that rightly apply to the Palestinians should apply equally to the Kurds.	正确适用于巴勒斯坦人的论据也应适用于库尔德人。
Human-rights activists who demonstrate for Palestinian statehood should be no less vocal on behalf of Kurdish statehood.	而那些巴勒斯坦建国鼓与呼的人权活动家也应代表库尔德国家发声。
And human-rights claims – unless they are applied selectively as part of a hypocritical sham – should always trump realpolitik.	人权要求 — — 除非它们被选择性地作为伪善表演的一部分来使用 — — 应该永远高于现实政治。
Throughout their long, tragic history, the Kurds have repeatedly been abandoned by the West, to its great shame.	应该令西方深感羞耻的是，库尔德人漫长而悲惨的历史也是一部一再被西方抛弃的历史。
This must not happen again.	这个状况不应再发生。
Kurdish Peshmerga have been Western democracies’ staunchest allies in the fight against the Islamic State.	库尔德民兵组织已经是西方民主国家对抗伊斯兰国的坚定盟友。
It would be a bitter travesty to abandon the Kurds to the mercy of the Iraqi or Turkish governments in their time of need.	而如果西方为了讨好伊拉克或土耳其政府而去抛弃库尔德人，只会让一切变成一场痛苦的闹剧。
	
Uniting Africa for Power	非洲的能源联盟
LONDON – African countries are increasingly coming together.	发自伦敦 — — 非洲国家正日益联合在一起。
A landmark free-trade agreement was concluded earlier this year.	今年早些时候签署了一项具有里程碑意义的自由贸易协定。
East Africa has made great progress on free movement of people.	东非地区也在人员自由流动方面取得了很大进展。
And a commitment to a single market for air travel has been revived, potentially connecting countries better than ever before.	同时对单一航空旅行市场的承诺也重新提上了日程，可以比以往任何时候都更好地将各国联系起来。
Each step toward greater cooperation and unity on the continent is, on its own, an important one.	在非洲大陆迈向更紧密合作与团结的每一步都是极为重要的。
Together they show how a new generation of African leaders understand that power in the twenty-first century reflects strength in numbers.	它们共同展现出新一代非洲领导人都意识到二十一世纪的影响力是通过多个力量的汇集来显现的。
But, for Africa, power requires power in another sense: a lack of electricity continues to hold back the continent’s progress.	但是对于非洲而言，影响力还需要另一种意义上的力量做支撑：电力短缺正持续阻碍着非洲大陆的进步。
And here, too, integration is essential to scale and connect markets, reduce consumer costs, and drive growth.	在此也必须通过整合来扩展和连接市场，降低消费者成本并推动增长。
Despite advances in recent years, more than 600 million Africans still lack access to electricity.	尽管近年来已经取得了大量进展，但仍有6亿多非洲人缺乏电力供应。
Solar technology has improved, and its declining cost has made it a viable option.	太阳能技术不断进步，而其逐渐降低的成本也使其成为了一个可行性选项。
Rising inflows of private capital have been accompanied by large-scale national energy-sector reforms, which should help increase the availability of electricity.	私人资本流入的增加伴随着大规模的国家能源部门改革，这将有助于增加电力供应。
But pushing down the price of power and making it available across growing cities and vast territories remains a daunting, and yet central, task.	但是降低电价并为不断扩大的城市和广阔的地区提供电力仍然是一项艰巨而又核心的任务。
All of the African leaders with whom I speak tell me that making electricity affordable is a top-priority issue, and most have set ambitious targets for power generation and transmission.	所有与我交谈过的非洲领导人都告诉我说提供负担得起的电力是首要问题，而且大多数人都针对发电和输电量制定了雄心勃勃的目标。
But achieving these targets requires adopting a mix of technologies, which is hard enough in the best circumstances, but even more so when countries try to go it alone.	但要实现这些目标必须采用多种技术相结合，而这即便在最好的状况下是极为艰难的，在各国试图单独行动时更是如此。
The fact is that resources are not evenly distributed among countries.	事实在于资源在各国之间的分配是不均衡的。
Some have gas, others hydrological resources.	有些国家有天然气，有些有水文资源。
Some have no particular resources and build thermal power plants or import expensive liquid fuels to meet their needs.	有些没有多少资源的国家依赖建造火力发电厂或进口昂贵的液体燃料以满足自身需求。
Added to this are planning issues, which usually go one of two ways: either too much or too little supply.	除此之外还有规划问题，而这通常会造成两种后果：供应要么过多，要么太少。
The most efficient way to overcome these costly electricity imbalances would be through a common energy market.	克服这些昂贵的电力不均衡状况的最有效方法就是建立共同的能源市场。
Much like the European Union’s internal market for electricity, power trading would ideally extend across Africa and form part of the continued evolution of the African Union, which Rwandan President Paul Kagame is so admirably pushing forward.	与欧盟内部的电力市场非常相似，电力交易在理想状态下会最终延伸到整个非洲，并成为持续推进的非洲联盟方略的一部分 — — 卢旺达总统保罗·卡加梅（Paul Kagame）正是那个令人钦佩的推手。
But high-volume power trading from Ethiopia to Lesotho is unlikely in the foreseeable future, and a more realistic path forward would be at the sub-regional level.	但在可预见的未来依然不太可能出现从埃塞俄比亚横跨整个大陆到莱索托的大量电力交易，所以更加现实的前进道路将是在次区域层面。
One such opportunity is through the West Africa Power Pool.	一个这样的机会是通过西非电力池。
Little more than half of the region’s population has access to electricity, and only around 3% of power generation currently crosses borders (based on current capacity levels).	该地区人口中只有不到一半能获得电力供应，而目前只有约3％的电力是跨国输送的（根据当前的发电能力水平 ） 。
With an integrated market, however, power demand could be met as countries such as Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire, and Guinea produce surpluses, while others such as Burkina Faso and Mali are in deficit and reliant on costly liquid fuels.	然而随着整合市场的发展，电力需求可以通过加纳，科特迪瓦和几内亚等电量富余国与布基纳法索和马里等其他以往依赖昂贵液体燃料的发电短缺国之间的调配来解决。
Such a sub-regional market would yield significant benefits not only for families, but also for governments and investors.	这样一个次区域市场不仅会给民众带来巨大好处，也会为政府和投资者产生极大收益。
More people would be connected, exporting countries could generate more revenue, and imports would become less expensive, more reliable, and cleaner.	更多人获得了电力，出口国可以创造更多收入，进口国也可以享有更便宜，更可靠，也更清洁的能源。
According to modeling by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change and the US government’s Power Africa, an integrated energy market would save the region $32 billion in energy costs in the next decade. With better infrastructure and increased supply, this figure could be many times more.	根据托尼·布莱尔全球变革研究所和美国国际开发署非洲电力项目的模型推算，一个整合性能源市场将在未来十年间为该地区节省320亿美元的能源成本，如果能更完善的基础设施和更多电力供应，这个数字还会成倍增加。
Developing a sub-regional market would also spur economic growth, create jobs, and boost income for millions of people.	发展这样一个次区域市场也将刺激经济增长，创造就业机会并为数百万人增加收入。
Private capital would be attracted to new opportunities as national markets open up for economies of scale in the production and transmission of electricity.	随着各国市场逐渐开放从而在发电输电方面实现规模经济，私人资本也会闻风而至。
From an environmental perspective, an integrated market would save around 23 million tons of fuel oil – roughly the equivalent of the United Kingdom’s annual fuel consumption by diesel vehicles.	从环境角度来看，这个整合市场将可以节省约2300万吨燃油 — — 大约相当于英国境内所有柴油车的年消耗量。
But to realize the potential of power trading, four conditions must be met.	但要发挥出电力交易的潜力必须满足四个条件。
For starters, the politics of trying to align national policies with a regional vision must change.	首先，试图将国内政策与区域愿景保持一致的政治操作必须改变。
Those of us with a long history in the EU will understand the difficulties of this better than most, and for some West African countries, rolling back costly and inefficient but politically popular subsidies will be difficult.	我们这些在欧盟摸爬滚打多年的人大概会比大多数人更了解这种困难，而对一些西非国家来说废除昂贵低效但政治上广受欢迎的补贴绝非易事。
The gains from trade would offset the effects, but this is likely to be a hard sell for politicians to make to their publics.	贸易收益将抵消这种影响，但政治家要说服选民可需要花很大力气。
Second, infrastructure needs to be developed to connect national markets.	其次，需要开发基础设施以连接各国市场。
International donors already are supporting much of this work.	国际捐助者已经在大力支持这项工作。
It is crucial to complete it, so that isolated grids are integrated into a unique regional market.	这一点的实现至关重要，只有这样才能让各自孤立的电网被整合到一个特定的的区域市场中。
Third, gas must become increasingly available.	第三，天然气的供应必须加大。
Nigeria is the most likely source; another is imports of inexpensive Liquefied Natural Gas.	尼日利亚是最有潜力的来源；而另一项渠道则是进口廉价的液化天然气。
Without the development of reserves, countries will need to revert to liquid fuels, at higher cost and larger carbon dioxide emissions.	如果缺乏天然气储备的开发，各国只能回归到成本更高且二氧化碳排放量更大的液体燃料。
Lastly, regulatory harmonization is essential to ensure the right enabling environment.	最后，监管协调对于保障合适的运作环境至关重要。
But so, too, is support for first-time, specific transactions – such as that along Africa’s west coast all the way from Côte d’Ivoire to Mauritania – which can help countries to overcome obstacles and open the door to future, more expansive power trading.	但对首轮特定交易（例如从科特迪瓦沿非洲西海岸输送到毛里塔尼亚的交易）的支持也特别重要，因为这可以帮助各国克服障碍，打开通向未来更广阔的电力贸易的大门。
Developing this internal market is key to West Africa’s energy future.	发展这个内部市场是西非能源未来的关键。
Over the next decade, it could have a major impact on the lives of more than 300 million people.	在未来十年，它可能会对超过3亿人的生活产生重大影响。
It would also be a significant step in Africa’s push for greater unity, more self-reliance, and an economy driven more by trade and less by aid. And it would reinforce the progress African leaders are making toward projecting strategic power in the world today.	这也将是推动非洲实现更广泛联合，更加自力更生，并在经济更多地受贸易驱动而非援助推动的重要一步，也将加强非洲领导人在当今世界战略力量投射上的前进步伐。
	
The West’s Unilateral Cold War	西方的单边冷战
MOSCOW – Rising tensions between the United Kingdom and Russia are but further proof that Russia and the West, according to no less an authority than Richard N. Haass, President of the Council on Foreign Relations, have entered a “Cold War II”.	莫斯科—用绝对权威、外交关系委员会（Council on Foreign Relations）主席理查德·哈斯（Richard N. Haass）的话说，英俄关系的日益紧张进一步证明，俄罗斯和西方已经进入了“第二次冷战 ” 。
I tend to disagree.	我对此不敢苟同。
Yes, Russia’s relations with the United States, and now also with the UK, are worse than in the 1950s, and the chance of a direct conflict is higher than at any time since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis.	诚然，俄美关系，以及今天的俄英关系，比20世纪50年代更加糟糕，发生直接冲突的可能性也比1962年古巴导弹危机以来任何时候都要高。
Given the complexity of today’s strategic nuclear weapons and the systems designed to neutralize them, one cannot rule out the possibility that some actor on either side, or a third party, could provoke escalation.	考虑到当今战略核武器和反核武器系统，你无法排除某一方或第三方的的某个行动方可能会发出挑衅令事态升级。
Making matters worse, communication between US and Russian leaders is all but nonexistent, owing to the lack of trust on both sides.	更糟糕的是，由于双方缺乏信任，美国和俄罗斯领导人之间毫无沟通。
Among Americans, feelings toward Russia verge on something close to hatred, and many in Russia now regard Americans with ill-concealed disdain.	美国人对俄罗斯的感觉在厌恶水平徘徊，而许多俄罗斯人毫不掩饰对美国人的鄙夷。
This psychological backdrop to the bilateral relationship truly is worse than during the Cold War.	这一双边关系的心理背景确实比冷战期间更加糟糕。
But that does not mean that today’s tensions amount to a sequel.	但这并不意味着今天的紧张局面会成为冷战重演。
Such a confrontation would require an ideological component that is decidedly lacking on the Russian side.	冷战级别冲突所需要的意识形态准备是俄罗斯方面绝对没有具备的。
Russia has no intention of waging another Cold War.	俄罗斯无意发动新的冷战。
Although some degree of confrontation with the US does help President Vladimir Putin unite the public while burnishing Russian elites’ nationalist credentials, Russia is not an ideologically motivated state.	尽管与美国产生一定程度的冲突确实有助于普京既团结了群众，又重新激发了俄罗斯精英的民族主义，但俄罗斯不是一个受意识形态驱动的国家。
What ideology it does have is based in Russian culture and civilization, which it is not interested in exporting.	其所具有的意识形态以俄罗斯文化和文明为基础，对输出意识形态不感兴趣。
The Kremlin in fact prefers not to proselytize on Russia’s behalf.	事实上，克里姆林宫更并不像代表俄罗斯改变路线。
Russia’s approach to international affairs has long centered on respect for national interests and sovereignty, and the belief that all peoples and nations should have the freedom to make their own political, economic, and cultural choices.	长期以以来，俄罗斯的外加方针以尊重国家利益和主权为核心，相信所有民族和国家都应该有自主做出政治、经济和文化选择的自由。
Russia also embraces universal human values such as trust in God, family, and country, as well as self-fulfillment through service to society and nation.	俄罗斯也信奉相信上帝、家庭和国家的普世人类价值观，以及通过服务于社会和国家完成自我实现的概念。
I dream of the possibility that even 2% of the accusations concerning Russian “interference” in the 2016 US election prove true.	我倒是梦想有关俄罗斯“干预”2016年美国大选的指责有2%为真。
It would bolster my self-esteem as a Russian, while educating Americans – whose government has long interfered in other countries’ internal affairs – about the dangers of throwing stones from a glass house.	这将大大提高我身为俄罗斯人的自尊心，同时也教育美国人 — — 他们的政府老是干预他国内政 — — 从玻璃房子里朝外面扔石头的危险。
But the problem between Russia and the West is really a problem among Westerners themselves.	但俄罗斯与西方之间的问题其实是西方人自己之间的问题。
The US establishment is using the scarecrow of Russian interference to regain its lost political control, particularly in the realm of social media, where a discontented population and maverick politicians have finally found a voice.	美国建制派用俄罗斯干预选举的稻草人重新赢得失去的政治控制权，特别是在社交媒体领域，不满的人民和迷失的正科终于觅得了声音。
But even if American elites do manage to wrest back control, the deeper source of Western angst will remain.	但即使美国精英真的成功赢回控制权，西方焦虑的深层次原因也仍然存在。
For at least the past decade, the world has been witnessing the endgame of the West’s 500-year hegemony.	至少在过去十年中，世界正在经历西方500年霸权的终局。
It started in the sixteenth century, when Europe developed better guns and warships and began its imperial expansion.	西方霸权始于十六世纪，当时的欧洲发展出更加优良的枪炮和舰船，开始了帝国主义扩张。
In the following centuries, Europeans would use their economic, cultural, political, and especially military dominance to siphon off the world’s wealth.	在接下来的几个世纪中，欧洲人利用他们的经济、文化、政治以及（特别是）军事主宰力攫取全世界的财富。
For a few decades in the second half of the twentieth century, the West’s dominant position was challenged by the Soviet Union and China.	在二十世纪下半叶的几十年里，西方的主宰地位受到了苏联和中国的挑战。
But after the Soviet Union imploded, the US emerged as the sole hegemon, and the world seemed to return to its historic status quo.	但苏联解体后，美国成为唯一的霸权，世界似乎又回到了历史现状。
Soon enough, however, the US overextended itself by plunging into geopolitical misadventures like the invasion of Iraq.	但很快，美国便用力过猛，陷入了入侵伊拉克等地缘政治不利局面。
And then came the 2008 financial crisis, which exposed the weaknesses of twenty-first-century capitalism.	接着发生了2008年金融危机，二十一世纪资本主义弱点尽显。
At the same time, the US has long pursued military superiority.	与此同时，美国一直追求超级军事力量。
In 2002, it unilaterally abrogated the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.	2002年，它单方面废除了1972年反弹道导弹条约。
And, more recently, it has embarked on a massive build-up of conventional forces and a large-scale modernization of its nuclear arsenal.	最近它又开始大规模发展常规力量和核武器现代化。
Still, Russia, China, and the rest of the world won’t allow a return to US hegemony.	尽管如此，俄罗斯、中国和世界其他国家不会允许美国恢复霸权。
Putin recently made this clear by unveiling a number of new, cutting-edge strategic weapons systems, as part of what I would call a strategy of “preemptive deterrence.”	最近普京清楚地释放了这一信号，向世人展示了大量新型尖端战略武器系统，这是我称之为“先发制人威慑”的战略的一部分。
The message was that the US cannot hope to regain absolute military superiority, even if it decides to bleed itself dry in an arms race, as the Soviet Union did.	普京想表达的是，美国没有希望重新获得绝对的军事支配权，即使它决心像曾经的苏联那样在军备竞赛中流尽最后一滴血。
Preliminary assessments that my colleagues and I recently carried outsuggest that even if the US decides to wage a unilateral Cold War, its chances against Russia, China, and other emerging powers would not be very good.	我的同事和我最近所做的初步评估表明，即使美国决定发动单方面冷战，其相对俄罗斯、中国和其他新兴力量的胜算也不大。
The balance of military, political, economic, and moral power has simply shifted too far away from the West to be reversed.	军事、政治、经济和道德实力的平衡变化已远，西方已经无法挽回。
Nonetheless, a new Cold War, even if largely one-sided, would be extremely dangerous for humanity.	尽管如此，新冷战（即使主要是单方面冷战）对于人类来说仍然是一个巨大的危险。
The world’s major powers should concentrate on strengthening international strategic stability through dialogue; reopening channels of communications between militaries; and restoring civility to their interactions.	世界主要力量应该集中精力通过对话加强国际战略稳定；重新开放军事沟通渠道；恢复交往礼仪。
We should also consider establishing more diplomatic, legislative, academic, and educational exchanges.	我们还应该考虑建立更多的外交、立法、学术和教育交流。
Most of all, though, we must stop demonizing each other.	但最重要的是，我们必须停止互相妖魔化。
The world is entering a dangerous period.	世界正在进入一个危险的时期。
But if we are wise, we can build a more balanced international system, one in which the major powers will deter one another while cooperating to solve global problems.	但如果我们明智的话，可以构建一个更加平衡的国际体系，在这个体系中，主要力量在彼此威慑的同时互相合作解决全球性问题。
Smaller countries, meanwhile, will be freer to develop according to their own political, cultural, and economic preferences.	与此同时，小国能够更加自由地根据自身政治、文化和经济偏好发展。
The previous, Western-led system has collapsed.	旧的西方领导的体系已经崩溃。
To ensure a peaceful future, we need to start working together to build a new one.	为了确保和平的未来，我们必须开始齐心协力构建一个新体系。
	
What the West Owes Ukraine	西方欠乌克兰什么
WASHINGTON, DC – Ukraine may not be grabbing as many headlines now as it did a year ago, but the crisis there is far from over.	华盛顿—如今，乌克兰也许已不再如去年那样吸引如此多的眼球，但危机还远未结束。
The latest ceasefire agreement, concluded in Minsk in February, has contained, but not stopped, Russian military aggression.	2月达成的最新的明斯克停火协议遏制但并未停止俄罗斯的入侵行为。
And, though the stabilization program that Ukraine agreed with the International Monetary Fund last month is superior to last year’s deal – this one includes both more financing from the IMF and a more credible economic-reform plan from the government – it will be insufficient to repair the country’s economy.	此外，尽管上个月乌克兰与国际货币基金组织（IMF）达成一致的稳定计划比去年的协议更近了一步 — — 新协议包括了IMF的融资和更加可信的乌克兰政府经济改革计划 — — 但仍不足以修复乌克兰经济。
What Ukraine really needs is to escape the old Soviet order – and, for that, it needs the West’s help.	乌克兰真正需要的是摆脱旧的苏联秩序 — — 而对于这一目标，它需要西方的帮助。
Ukraine never managed to recast its state after the Soviet Union’s collapse.	苏联解体后，乌克兰从未重建国家。
Instead, the old Soviet elites held onto power – and most of the country’s wealth – through corrupt practices that became entrenched in the country’s economy and political system.	相反，旧苏联精英通过根深蒂固于乌克兰经济和政治体系的腐败把持着权力 — — 以及大部分财富。
Reforming both will be a major challenge – one that Ukraine’s leaders have lately committed themselves to meeting.	改革经济和政治将是一项艰巨挑战 — — 乌克兰领导人最近承诺直面这一挑战。
Since February of last year, when the parliament voted then-President Viktor Yanukovych out of power by more than a two-thirds majority, Ukraine has held fresh elections for both institutions.	自去年2月议会以三分之二以上多数罢免时任总统亚努科维奇（Viktor Yanukovych）以来，乌克兰两大机构已经举行了新选举。
Hundreds of top officials have been replaced by young, Western-educated professionals, and the government is now working feverishly to implement deep and comprehensive reforms, including a new law on public procurement and a package of anti-corruption legislation.	数百高级官员被受西方教育的年轻专业人士和取代，政府如今正干劲十足地实施全面的深度改革，包括一部关于公共部门采购的法律和一系列反腐败立法。
Dozens of superfluous inspection agencies have been abolished, significantly reducing the regulatory burden.	数十家没有必要的监察机构被取消，大大降低了监管负担。
Just last month, President Petro Poroshenko sacked the governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region, the billionaire tycoon Igor Kolomoisky	上个月，总统波罗申科撤掉了第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克地区主席、亿万富翁伊格尔·科洛莫伊斯基（Igor Kolomoisky ） 。
More recently, the authorities have been working to reform the energy sector – a hub of corruption.	最近，当局一直在致力于能源部门改革。 能源部门是腐败重灾区。
On April 1, household gas prices were quadrupled, taking them to half the market price, with offsetting compensation provided to the poor.	4月1日，家庭天然气价格提高了四倍，达到了市场价格的一半，穷人可以获得抵价补贴。
And the parliament has enacted a law that harmonizes energy standards with those of the European Union, thereby delineating clearly the state’s role and opening the gas market to investors.	议会也实施了使能源标准与欧盟看齐的法律，从而廓清了政府的角色、将天燃气市场向投资者开放。
But Ukraine still has a long way to go.	但乌克兰仍有很长的路要走。
The good news is that the public largely understands and supports the government’s reform efforts.	好消息是公众大多理解并支持政府的改革措施。
The bad news is that Ukraine still faces considerable destabilizing threats – beginning with a renewed Russian military offensive.	坏消息是乌克兰面临着诸多破坏性威胁 — — 如俄罗斯军事进攻卷土重来。
A Russian attack on, say, Mariupol, eastern Ukraine’s second-largest port (accounting for roughly one-third of the country’s exports), would devastate an economy that is already tanking.	俄罗斯对（比如）乌克兰东部第二大港口马里乌波尔（Mariupol，贡献了乌克兰出口的三分之一左右）的袭击将摧毁已然步履蹒跚的乌克兰经济。
Though several factors – including Western sanctions, a lack of public support for war in Ukraine, and the Russian economy’s rapid decline – should discourage the Kremlin from taking such a step, they may not be enough.	尽管诸多因素 — — 包括西方制裁你、对乌战争缺乏公众支持，以及俄罗斯经济的快速衰落 — — 应该让克里姆林宫不会采取这一举动，但也许还不够。
After all, Russia’s leaders have shown themselves to be unpredictable.	毕竟，俄罗斯领导人早已证明了自己的不可预测性。
Even absent further Russian aggression, Ukraine’s economic woes could prevent further progress on reform.	即使没有俄罗斯的进一步侵略，乌克兰经济换乱也可能阻挠进一步改革。
The economy contracted by 6.8% year on year in 2014, and output has plunged by 15% in each of the two last quarters.	2014年，乌克兰经济同比收缩6.8 % ， 过去两个季度同比产出均大降15 % 。
Moreover, at the end of February, with the country running low on reserves, Ukraine’s currency, the hryvnia, lost half its value; as a result, annualized inflation surged to 45% in March.	此外，2月底，由于储备减少，乌克兰货币格里夫尼亚价值跌去一半；结果，3月份年化通胀率飙升至45 % 。
A full-scale financial meltdown was avoided only when the IMF provided an early disbursement that doubled Ukraine’s reserves, to $9.9 billion; by the end of the month, the exchange rate more or less recovered.	要不是IMF的首笔援助让乌克兰储备翻了一番，回到99亿美元按，全面金融崩溃已在所难免；3月底，汇率总算有所恢复。
Nonetheless, the international financing that Ukraine has received, though invaluable, remains insufficient to support genuine recovery and reform.	尽管如此，乌克兰所收到的国际融资虽然重要，但仍不足以支持真正的复苏和改革。
The latest bailout program foresees about $40 billion in funding, nearly half of which will come from the IMF, over the next four years.	最新援助计划预计将在未来四年达到400亿美元左右，其中近一半将来自IMF。
That means that, this year, Ukraine will receive only $10 billion – not enough to enable the country to replenish its reserves and service its debts.	这意味着今年乌克兰只能收到100亿美元 — — 不足以补充储备和维持债务。
Indeed, given Ukraine’s large bond debts, many of which will mature in the next two years, there is a $15.3 billion funding gap in the bailout package, which the IMF and Ukraine’s government hope to plug with a debt restructuring.	事实上，由于乌克兰有巨量债券债务将在未来两年内到期，援助计划还有153亿美元的资金缺口，IMF和乌克兰政府希望通过债务重组解决。
But, even if they succeed, Ukraine would need more funding than it is getting.	但是，即使它们成功，乌克兰仍需要比其所获得的更多的资金。
It needs more strategic support as well.	乌克兰还需要更多的战略支持。
European politicians’ overwhelming opposition to supplying Ukraine with defensive arms is difficult to fathom.	欧洲政客一边倒地反对向乌克��提供防御武装，这一态度令人难以琢磨。
Europe’s leaders claim that they want to avoid giving Russia reason to escalate its war on Ukraine.	欧洲领导人宣称他们是想避免给俄罗斯口实发动对乌战争。
But that is already happening, and Ukraine’s fight against Russia is, after all, a defense of core European values – and, indeed, of Europe itself.	但对乌战争已经发生了，并且乌克兰与俄罗斯的战斗归根结底是捍卫欧洲核心价值的战斗 — — 事实上也是捍卫欧洲自身的战斗。
The EU flag has draped the caskets of Ukrainians killed in that fight.	在这场战斗中死去的乌克兰人棺木上都覆盖着欧盟旗帜。
Europe’s leaders argue that the central focus of their policy toward Ukraine must be to support its economic recovery.	欧洲领导人指出，他们的对乌政策的核心关注点必须放在支持其经济复苏上。
But here, too, Europe is doing too little, offering paltry credits of €1.8 billion ($1.9 billion) this year, when €10 billion would be more appropriate.	但在这方面欧洲做得也远远不够，今年只提供了微不足道的18亿欧元信贷，合理的数字应该在100亿欧元。
If the United States then met Europe halfway (at least), Ukraine’s financial crisis could finally be contained.	如果美国可以提供（至少）相当于欧洲的一半的援助，那么乌克兰金融危机最终可以遏制。
On April 28, Ukraine’s government will host a donor conference in Kyiv.	4月28日，乌克兰政府将在基辅举行援助者会议。
At a time when the country’s leaders and public are more committed than ever to combating corruption, building a welfare-creating economy, and becoming a normal liberal democracy, Europe should be eager to support it.	乌克兰领导人和乌克兰公众许下了前所未有的打击腐败、建设创造福祉的经济、成为正常自由民主国家的承诺，欧洲应该热情地支持他们。
It is time for Western politicians to remember their ideals – and stand up for them.	西方政客应该铭记他们的理想 — — 并为它们而奋斗。
	
Aligning the West for an Uncertain World	理顺西方联盟，应对不确定的世界
LONDON – In 2016, the United Kingdom made the momentous decision to leave the European Union, Donald Trump was elected President of the United States, and many European countries continued to struggle with internal challenges.	伦敦—2016年，英国做出了一个至关重要的决定 — — 脱离欧盟。 唐纳德·特朗普当选为美国总统，许多欧洲国家继续与内部挑战搏斗。
The EU feels less stable than at any point in my lifetime.	欧盟比我这辈子任何时候都更不稳定。
There are common forces that brought us to this dangerous place, and it is more important than ever that the developed democracies come together to address them.	让我们处于这一危险局面的是一些共同力量，而发达民主国家团结起来解决这些力量也变得前所未有地重要。
Sadly, the opposite is happening.	悲哀的是，趋势与此完全相反。
Just when the West needs alignment among the US, the UK, and the EU, national politics are pulling it apart.	西方需要与美国形成一致，但英国以及欧盟的国家政治让西方与美国渐行渐远。
Within Europe, there are three major challenges.	欧洲内部存在三大主要挑战。
The first is Brexit, the biggest event in British politics in a generation.	其一是英国退欧，这是二十多年来英国最重大的政治事件。
Many think that withdrawal from the EU is a mistake; but it is what more than half of those who voted decided, so now we have to implement it.	许多人认为退出欧盟是一个错误；但这是一大半投票公民的选择，因此我们现在必须落实它。
It won’t be easy.	这绝非易事。
Translating the vote into policy will be like defusing a bomb: determining which wires to cut will require great care.	将投票转化为政策就像是拆弹：决定剪断哪根电线必须慎之又慎。
If Prime Minister Theresa May’s government focuses on what really matters in the upcoming negotiations with the EU, we can be guardedly optimistic that it will return with a good deal.	如果首相梅的政府在接下来的与欧盟的谈判中聚焦于真正重要的东西，我们可以谨慎乐观地认为能够达成好交易。
Europe has a clear economic interest in keeping the UK close, and it needs the UK’s diplomatic, military, and intelligence capabilities.	与英国保持紧密关系显然符合欧洲的经济利益，欧洲需要英国的外交、军事和情报力量。
The UK also has a strong relationship with the US, and will remain an important part of the transatlantic security axis.	英国也需要与美国保持强大的关系，并继续充当跨大西洋安全轴心的重要组成部分。
Meanwhile, we Britons should acknowledge that many EU laws and regulations have become our own, and that we share many common goals and joint programs.	与此同时，我们英国人应该承认，许多欧盟法律和监管已经成为我们自己的法律和监管，并且我们有许多共同目标和合作项目。
We need not change all of these, nor should we discount the value of having access to the EU single market.	我们不需要改变一切，也不需要贬低进入欧盟单一市场的价值。
Europe is the largest economic bloc in the world by some measures, and it is a significant source of investment in the UK.	从某些衡量角度看，欧洲是全世界最大的经济体，也是英国重要的投资来源地。
The distinction between a “hard” or “soft” Brexit misses the point.	区分“硬”和“软”退欧没有切中要害。
The negotiations will be so complex that certain outcomes are bound to be soft, while others will be hard.	谈判是复杂的，必定既有软结果，也有硬结果。
The UK may be able to pay a price for access to the single market, “passporting” for financial services, or control over immigration from the EU.	英国可以为进入单一市场、金融服务的“通行”和控制来自欧盟的移民付出一定代价。
The second big challenge within Europe is weak economic growth and competitiveness.	欧洲的第二个大挑战是疲软的经济增长和孱弱的竞争力。
Growth in European economies is lower than in the US and most Asian countries, energy costs are twice those of the US, and labor costs are twice those of Asia.	欧洲经济体的增长不如美国和大部分亚洲国家，而能源成本是美国的两倍，劳动力成本是亚洲的两倍。
EU countries urgently need to deregulate their markets and make their industries more competitive, which the UK has long advocated.	欧盟各国急需减少市场监管、加强产业竞争力，而这正是英国长期支持的。
The third challenge for Europe is social inequality.	欧洲的第三个挑战是社会不平等。
A quarter of young people in Spain, Portugal, and Greece are unemployed, and many people sense that the rewards of prosperity are not being fairly distributed.	西班牙、葡萄牙和希腊有四分之一年轻人失业，许多人认为繁荣的成果没有公平分配。
While globalization has been good for the world overall, it has left many people behind.	尽管全球化对世界整体来说是一件好事，但也有许多人落后了。
These people are now making their voices heard at the ballot box, and we need to listen to them, and respond to their concerns.	如今这些人正在通过投票箱发出自己的声音，而我们也需要聆听他们的声音，响应他们的关注点。
Indeed, social inequality is even worse in the US than in Europe.	事实上，美国的社会不平等比欧洲更加糟糕。
Many Rust Belt households’ incomes haven’t risen for 30 years, and many of those households helped elect a president who has promised to turn the country inward.	许多锈带家庭的收入30年未见提高，其中许多家庭帮助一位承诺让美国向内转的总统赢得大选。
The US must avoid this temptation.	美国必须抵挡住这一诱惑。
A dangerous world needs an actively engaged America, one that maintains security, defense, and intelligence cooperation with countries such as the UK.	危险的世界需要积极介入的美国，一个保持与英国等国家的安全、防务和情报合作的美国。
That transatlantic alignment has safeguarded global peace and prosperity for 70 years, and it will be needed to confront looming global threats.	70年来，这一跨大西洋联盟捍卫了全球和平与繁荣，面对迫在眉睫的全球威胁也需要这一联盟。
For starters, Russia’s incursion into Ukraine and annexation of Crimea were an affront to the rule of law; and yet Europe and the US must maintain constructive relations with Russia for the sake of global stability.	首先，俄罗斯入侵乌克兰、吞并克里米亚是对法治的践踏，但欧洲和美国必须为了全球稳定而与俄罗斯保持建设性关系。
The UK can help: while it is a party to sanctions against Russia, British companies have investments there, and vice versa.	英国可助一臂之力：尽管它参与了对俄制裁，但英国公司仍在俄罗斯进行投资活动，反之亦然。
Second, the prolonged conflicts in Iraq and Syria have left a vacuum in a crucial region, and the old alliances have failed to take concerted action to address it.	其次，旷日持久的伊拉克和叙利亚冲突在关键地区留下了一个真空地带，旧联盟没能采取实质行动解决这一问题。
But the West must bring peace to the region, even if Russia’s involvement has introduced new complications.	但西方必须实现该地区的和平，即便俄罗斯的介入带来了新的复杂性。
Similarly, an US-UK-EU axis will be necessary for dealing with North Africa, where some countries lack stable governments and have become incubators for terrorism and immigration to Europe.	类似地，美国-英国-欧盟轴心是应对北非局面的必要条件。 一些北非国家缺少稳定的政府，沦为恐怖主义的温床和流向欧洲的移民的源头。
We in the West have stopped playing a direct role on these fronts; in some cases, we helped create the instability.	我们西方人已经不再在这些领域直接参与；在一些例子中，我们甚至是动荡的推手。
If we continue to turn inward, Russia and other countries will be able to step in and gain influence and prestige.	如果我们继续向内转，俄罗斯和其他国家就可以介入，赢得影响力和特殊地位。
The US, the UK, and the EU must show a united front, and continue to work through multilateral organizations such as NATO.	美国、英国和欧盟必须结成统一战线，并继续支持北约等多边组织。
Displaying leadership on the world stage only makes us stronger.	在世界舞台上展现领导力只会让我们更加强大。
The forces that are now pulling at the threads of the post-1945 international order must be resisted.	与1945年后的国际秩序角力的力量必须得到抵制。
The US, the UK, and the EU have a shared heritage that should be protected.	美国、英国和欧盟有着共同的传承，并且应该保护这一传承。
There is no reason why precious legacies such as the rule of law should be jeopardized simply because Britain is leaving the EU and America has elected a leader who is challenging some aspects of traditional thinking.	法治等宝贵遗产决不能仅仅因为英国退出欧盟和美国选出了一位在某些角度挑战传统思维的总统而受到影响。
We must protect the ties that bind, and place our hope for the future in our alliances and shared traditions.	我们必须拧成一股绳，寄希望于我们的联盟和共同传统的未来。
	
The West’s Crisis of Confidence	西方的信心危机
STOCKHOLM – In an age defined by US President Donald Trump’s rage, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s revisionism, and Chinese President Xi Jinping’s unbridled ambition, the international order is becoming increasingly disorderly, dysfunctional, and even dangerous.	发自斯德哥尔摩 — — 在这个以美国总统特朗普的愤怒，俄罗斯总统普京的修正主义以及中国国家主席习近平毫不掩饰的野心为标志的时代，国际秩序变得日益无序，失调甚至危机重重。
How did we arrive at this state of affairs?	那么我们又是如何走到这一步的？
And how can we leave it behind?	又将如何拜托它？
Until recently, the era following World War II was a time of benevolent liberal internationalism.	直到最近，我们还置身于二战后开启的仁慈的自由国际主义时代。
The postwar order had begun to take shape as early as 1941, when US President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill drafted the Atlantic Charter on a ship anchored in Canada’s Placentia Bay.	战后秩序早在1941年就开始形成，当时美国总统富兰克林·罗斯福和英国首相丘吉尔在一艘停泊在加拿大普拉森西亚湾的船上起草了《大西洋宪章 》 。
Though Hitler had been victorious on the battlefields of Europe, Churchill and Roosevelt were determined not only to defeat the Nazi onslaught, but also to lay the groundwork for a future of peace and democracy.	尽管希特勒在欧洲战场上节节胜利，但丘吉尔和罗斯福不仅下定决心要击败纳粹，还要为和平与民主的未来奠定基础。
They succeeded beyond what they probably imagined was possible.	他们取得了甚至连自己都意料不到的成功。
After the Atlantic Charter came the United Nations, the Bretton Woods institutions, the global trade system, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and much more.	在《大西洋宪章》之后先后诞生了联合国，布雷顿森林机构，全球贸易体系 ， 《 世界人权宣言》等等。
During the postwar decades of decolonization, many new countries emerged, and former enemies united under new alliances and an overarching structure of integration.	在战后几十年的去殖民化过程中涌现了许多新的国家，曾经的敌人在多个新联盟以及一体化的整体架构下联合了起来。
China’s great “opening up” and the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991 marked the start of a quarter-century of truly remarkable global progress.	中国伟大的“开放”政策和1991年苏联的崩溃标志着一场持续1/4个世纪的真正意义重大的全球性进步拉开了序幕。
In fact, judging by standard economic, political, and social indicators, it might well have been the best quarter-century in human history.	事实上，从标准的经济，政治和社会指标来看，它可能是人类历史上最好的25年。
There were no major wars between superpowers, global trade expanded and drove economic growth, poverty was more than halved, and rapid advances in science and technology delivered benefits to every corner of the world.	超级大国之间并未爆发重大战争，全球贸易扩大并推动了经济增长，贫困人口数量减少了一半以上，科学技术的迅速进步令世界的每个角落都有所受益。
In recent years, however, the world has entered a new phase.	但这几年来世界又进入了一个新的阶段。
The politics of idealism and hope have been replaced by the politics of identity and fear.	充满理想主义和希望的政治已经被身份认同和恐惧的政治所取代。
This trend took root in one Western country after another, but its most notable manifestations have been in the two Anglo-Saxon countries that made the previous period of miraculous progress possible in the first place.	这一趋势在一个又一个西方国家落地生根，但其表现最为显著的则是两个使得前一阶段的奇迹般进步成为现实的盎格鲁-撒克逊国家。
Today, the confused political debates in the United Kingdom are tragic to behold.	今天，英国这些令人摸不着头脑的政治辩论注定没有好下场。
Since the June 2016 Brexit referendum, Britain has searched in vain for an illusory concept of sovereignty that might prevent the massive loss of international power and influence that awaits it after its departure from the European Union.	自2016年6月脱欧公投以来，英国一直在徒劳地寻找一种虚幻的主权概念以阻止其脱离欧盟后即将迎来的大规模国际势力和影响力流失。
The kind of global statesmanship that the UK once offered the world has given way to parochial bickering.	英国曾经为世界提供的那种全球政治家的姿态已经被狭隘的争吵所取代。
But the confused politics of Trump’s White House are of even greater consequence.	但特朗普治下的白宫接连出台的那些让人莫名其妙的政治举措则后果更严重。
For decades, the White House was a font of global leadership; today, it is a source of belligerent rhetoric that does not even pay lip service to the idea of a global order.	数十年来“白宫”一直是全球领导力的代名词；如今它变成了好战言论的发源地，甚至对全球秩序不屑一顾。
Indeed, the Trump administration’s official National Security Strategy portrays US efforts to safeguard the global order as counterproductive and self-defeating.	事实上，特朗普政府发表的官方国家安全战略描绘了美国为维护全球秩序而作出的努力是如何产生反作用和自我挫败的。
The future it envisions will be defined wholly by conflicts between sovereign countries.	它所设想的未来将完全充斥着主权国家之间的冲突。
Revisions to America’s strategic posture would be a reasonable response to Russian aggression and rule-breaking, particularly in Eastern Europe, and to China’s growing assertiveness on the world stage.	对美国战略态势的修正本应是对俄罗斯侵略行径和违规行为（尤其是在东欧）以及中国在世界舞台上越来越强硬态度的合理反应。
But the US president’s first instinct should be to defend the international order against rising threats, while making adjustments to account for new realities.	但美国总统的第一本能应该是捍卫国际秩序免遭不断增长的威胁，同时作出调整以适应新的现实。
Addressing climate change, increased migration, and the revolution in information and communication technologies (ICT) will require new, comprehensive international agreements to protect the interests of sovereign countries.	应对气候变化，移民增加以及信息和通信技术革命将需要崭新的全面国际协议来保护主权国家的利益。
Sadly, the pronouncements from Trump’s White House seem to be aimed at undermining any sense of order, with the hope that the US will come out on top in some future Hobbesian struggle for total global dominance.	但可悲的是，特朗普白宫发表的声明似乎旨在破坏秩序，期望美国能在对未来全球统治地位的某种霍布斯式（每个人与每个人为敌）的斗争中脱颖而出。
By this logic, international trade should be regulated not by rules and institutions, but through unilateral protectionist measures and arm-twisting.	照此逻辑，国际贸易不应受规则和制度的约束，而应通过单方面的贸易保护主义措施和扳手腕角力来制定规则。
And institutions like the EU – which aims to ensure order and stability through integration – are treated with indifference, if not disdain.	而像欧盟这样的机构 — — 即旨在通过一体化整合来确保秩序和稳定性 — — 就算不会遭到蔑视，也会被丢在角落。
From China’s perspective, the Trump administration’s Hobbesian vision could prove appealing, provided that its economy continues to grow, and that it avoids serious domestic social or political upheaval.	从中国的角度来看，只要经济能持续增长并避免严重的国内社会或政治动荡，特朗普政府的霍布斯式愿景就更具吸引力。
After all, with fewer global rules, China will face even fewer obstacles when asserting its growing influence abroad.	毕竟随着全球规则的削减，中国在攫取其日益增长的海外影响力时将面临更少的障碍。
In this scenario, the loser would undoubtedly be the wider West, meaning not just Europe but countries like India, which will remain committed to liberal democracy, economic openness, and the values underpinning that miraculous quarter-century after the Cold War.	在这种情况下失败者无疑就是更广泛意义上的西方，这不仅意味着欧洲，还包括像印度这样继续秉承自由民主，经济开放以及构筑了冷战后那1/4个奇迹世纪的价值观的国家。
Even barring worst-case scenarios, the West will be facing a new world with new aspirants making new demands about the future.	即使将最坏的情况排除在外，西方也将面对一个新的世界，那些新崛起者会对未来提出新的要求。
It would thus be a fateful mistake for Western powers to abandon the ideas and institutions that delivered prosperity and stability in previous decades.	因此，一众西方大国放弃过去几十年实现繁荣与稳定的思想和制度就是犯一个致命的错误。
Above all, the two countries most responsible for creating the postwar international order must not turn their backs on it now.	最重要的是，那两个对创建战后国际秩序负有最大责任的国家现在决不能走向这一秩序的反面。
	
The Age of Financial Repression	金融抑制时代
TILBURG – Following his re-election, US President Barack Obama almost immediately turned his attention to reining in America’s rising national debt.	蒂尔堡—美国总统奥巴马获得连任后，几乎立刻将注意力转向了控制美国节节攀升的国民债务的问题。
In fact, almost all Western countries are implementing policies aimed at reducing – or at least arresting the growth of – the volume of public debt.	事实上，几乎所有西方国家都在实施旨在减少公债规模的政策，至少不能再让公债继续上升。
In their widely cited paper “Growth in a Time of Debt,” Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart argue that, when government debt exceeds 90% of GDP, countries suffer slower economic growth.	在他们广为引用的《债务时代的增长 》 （ Growth in a Time of Debt）中，肯尼斯·罗格夫（Kenneth Rogoff）和卡门·莱因哈特（Carmen Reinhart）指出，当政府债务突破GDP的90%时，国家就会遭受经济增长减速。
Many Western countries’ national debt is now dangerously near, and in some cases above, this critical threshold.	许多西方国家的国民债务距离这一门槛已相当接近，不少国家更是已经超出。
Indeed, according to the OECD, by the end of this year, America’s national debt/GDP ratio will climb to 108.6%.	事实上，根据经合组织的数据，到今年年底，美国国民债务/GDP比率将攀升至108.6 % 。
Public debt in the eurozone stands at 99.1% of GDP, led by France, where the ratio is expected to reach 105.5%, and the United Kingdom, where it will reach 104.2%.	欧元区公债水平将达到GDP的99.1 % ， 其中法国的公债/GDP比率将达到105.55。 英国的公债/GDP比率将为104.2 % 。
Even well disciplined Germany is expected to close in on the 90% threshold, at 88.5%.	即使最守纪律的德国预计也将逼近90%的门槛，达到88.5 % 。
Countries can reduce their national debt by narrowing the budget deficit or achieving a primary surplus (the fiscal balance minus interest payments on outstanding debt).	各国可以通过降低预算赤字或实现基本盈余（财政余额减去存量债务的利息）降低国民债务水平。
This can be accomplished through tax increases, government-spending cuts, faster economic growth, or some combination of these components.	要达到这一目标，可以通过增税、削减政府支出、加快经济增长或以上三者的结合实现。
When the economy is growing, automatic stabilizers work their magic.	当经济开始增长时，自动稳定器就会发生魔力。
As more people work and earn more money, tax liabilities rise and eligibility for government benefits like unemployment insurance falls.	随着更多的人开始工作挣钱，纳税额会上升，申领失业救济等政府福利者会减少。
With higher revenues and lower payouts, the budget deficit diminishes.	收入增加和支出减少双管齐下，预算赤字就会开始降低。
But in times of slow economic growth, policymakers’ options are grim.	但在经济增长缓慢的时期，决策者的选择范围极其有限。
Increasing taxes is not only unpopular; it can be counter-productive, given already-high taxation in many countries.	增税不但会为民众所反对；同时也不利于生产，因为许多国家的税负已经相当高了。
Public support for spending cuts is also difficult to win.	对支出削减的民众支持也很难胜出。
As a result, many Western policymakers are seeking alternative solutions – many of which can be classified as financial repression.	结果，许多西方决策者只能寻找替代方案 — — 其中很多可以归类为金融抑制。
Financial repression occurs when governments take measures to channel to themselves funds that, in a deregulated market, would go elsewhere.	当政府采取措施将自由市场条件下会流向他处的资金引导到自己手中时，金融抑制就发生了。
For example, many governments have implemented regulations for banks and insurance companies that increase the amount of government debt that they own.	比如，许多政府实施了银行和保险公司监管，增加了后两者所持有的政府债务数量。
Consider the Basel III international banking standards.	考虑巴塞尔III国际银行标准。
Among other things, Basel III stipulates that banks do not have to set aside cash against their investments in government bonds with ratings of AA- or higher.	巴塞尔III规定银行不必为AA-及以上信用级别的政府债券投资拔备现金。
Moreover, investments in bonds issued by their home governments require no buffer, regardless of the rating.	此外，投资母国政府发行的债券也不要求缓冲资金，不管评级如何。
Meanwhile, Western central banks are using another kind of financial repression by maintaining negative real interest rates (yielding less than the rate of inflation), which enables them to service their debt for free.	与此同时，西方各大央行在使用另一种金融抑制 — — 维持实际利率为负（收益率低于通胀率 ） ， 这让它们能够免费地维持债务。
The European Central Bank’s policy rate stands at 0.75%, while the eurozone’s annual inflation rate is 2.5%.	欧洲央行的政策利率维持在0.75 % ， 而欧元区年通货膨胀率为2.5 % 。
Likewise, the Bank of England keeps its policy rate at only 0.5%, despite an inflation rate that hovers above 2%.	类似地，英格兰银行政策利率只有0.5 % ， 而其通货膨胀率在2%以上。
And, in the United States, where inflation exceeds 2%, the Federal Reserve’s benchmark federal funds rate remains at an historic low of 0-0.25%.	在美国，通胀率也超过2 % ， 而美联储的基准联邦基金利率仍维持在0—0.15%的历史低点。
Moreover, given that the ECB, the Bank of England, and the Fed are venturing into capital markets – via quantitative easing (QE) in the US and the UK, and the ECB’s “outright monetary transactions” (OMT) program in the eurozone – long-term real interest rates are also negative (the real 30-year interest rate in the US is positive, but barely).	此外，由于欧洲央行、英格兰银行和美联储正在涉足资本市场 — — 美国和英国以“量化宽松 ” （ QE）的方式，欧元区的欧洲央行以“直接货币交易 ” （ OMT）的方式 — — 长期真实利率也呈现出负水平（美国30年期真实利率虽然为正，但比零高不了多少 ） 。
Such tactics, in which banks are nudged, not coerced, into investing in government debt, constitute “soft” financial repression.	这些措施诱导而非强迫银行投资于政府债券，属于“软”金融抑制。
But governments can go beyond such methods, demanding that financial institutions maintain or increase their holdings of government debt, as the UK’s Financial Service Authority did in 2009.	但政府可以超越这些手段，要求金融机构维持或增持政府债务，2009年英国金融服务局便如此做过。
Similarly, in 2011, Spanish banks increased their lending to the government by almost 15%, even though private-sector lending contracted and the Spanish government became less creditworthy.	类似地，2011年，西班牙银行的政府贷款数量增加了将近15 % ， 而与此同时，私人部门贷款量在减少，西班牙政府的信誉也在走下坡路。
A senior Italian banker once said that Italian banks would be hanged by the Ministry of Finance if they sold any of their government-debt holdings.	一位意大利银行业资深人士曾说，意大利银行会被财政部追杀，如果它们胆敢出售所持有的政府债务的话。
And a Portuguese banker declared that, while banks should reduce their exposure to risky government bonds, government pressure to buy more was overwhelming.	某葡萄牙银行家也说，尽管银行应该减少其高风险政府债务敞口，政府却在强迫他们买入更多。
In addition, in many countries, including France, Ireland, and Portugal, governments have raided pension funds in order to finance their budget deficits.	此外，在许多国家（包括法国、爱尔兰和葡萄牙 ） ， 为了给财政赤字融资，政府还把手伸向了养老基金。
The UK is poised to take similar action, “allowing” local government pension funds to invest in infrastructure projects.	英国也即将采取类似措施 ， “ 允许”地方政府养老基金投资基础设施项目。
Direct or indirect monetary financing of budget deficits used to rank among the gravest sins that a central bank could commit.	曾几何时，直接或间接的货币融资被视为央行最大的犯罪之一。
QE and OMT are simply new incarnations of this old transgression.	QE和OMT无非是披着新衣的老罪行。
Such central-bank policies, together with Basel III, mean that financial repression will likely define the economic landscape for at least another decade.	这类央行政策与巴塞尔III一道，意味着金融抑制至少将在未来十年继续决定经济图景。
	
Westernize the Black Sea Region	黑海地区的西化
The bloody end to the schoolhouse hostage crisis in North Ossetia, and recent clashes in Georgia between government troops and separatist forces, have put the troubled Black Sea region on the front pages of newspapers once again.	北奥塞梯校园人质事件的血腥结尾和格鲁吉亚政府军及分离武装不久前发生的冲突使本来就麻烦不断的黑海地区再次登上了各大报章的头版。
This rising violence is also a wake-up call for the West, highlighting the need for a new Euro-Atlantic strategy in a vitally important region that lies at the crossroads of Europe, Eurasia, and the Middle East.	日益严重的暴力也呼唤着西方的觉醒，也再次告诉我们建立新的欧洲－大西洋战略关系有多么必要。 黑海地区地处欧洲、欧亚大陆和中东地区的交叉地带，其战略位置的重要性无需讳言。
Indeed, the Black Sea region is the Euro-Atlantic community's eastern frontier with the wider Middle East.	实际上，黑海地区与幅员辽阔的中东地区接壤，构成了欧洲－大西洋共同体的东侧边境线。
With Afghanistan, Iraq, and Iran topping the list of strategic challenges facing the West, anchoring democracy and security in these new borderlands of the Euro-Atlantic community has become imperative for both the United States and the EU.	由于西方目前最严峻的挑战来自阿富汗、伊拉克和伊朗等中东国家，因此对欧盟和美国来讲，在欧洲－大西洋共同体的新边界实现民主与安全确实刻不容缓。
Moreover, success here can provide lessons in how to facilitate the daunting process of reform and modernization in the wider Middle East.	另外，这里的成功还可以积累经验，从而推动中东地区令人生畏的改革和现代化进程。
Georgia's "Rose Revolution" last winter demonstrated that the will to implement radical reform now exists.	时至今日，推行极端改革的意愿依然存在，这从去年冬天发生在格鲁吉亚的"玫瑰革命"中可见一斑。
For the first time, a country in the region is matching its aspirations with the concrete steps needed to become a viable candidate for eventual membership in Euro-Atlantic institutions.	有史以来第一次，该地区的国家制定了加入欧洲－大西洋共同体的具体实施计划。
A visitor to Georgia's capital, Tbilisi, now sees the same level of determination to join the West that existed a decade ago in the Baltic states.	如果去格鲁吉亚首都第比利斯看一看，就可以感受到他们加入西方共同体的坚定决心与10年前的波罗的海诸国几乎没什么两样。
America and Europe share an interest in the success of these efforts, particularly as they seek to diversify energy supplies away from Saudi Arabian and Persian Gulf oil.	如果努力成功，美国和欧洲都会从中受益，尤其是他们都希望从沙特阿拉伯和波斯湾以外获取石油资源。
The Black Sea is poised to become a key conduit for non-OPEC, non-Gulf oil and natural gas flowing into European markets and beyond.	黑海注定会成为欧佩克和海湾以外原油和天然气流入欧洲市场的重要渠道。
The Black Sea region's long-term stability and integration with the West is thus critically important to the long-term energy security strategy of EU and NATO members.	也正因如此，黑海地区实现长期稳定和与西方的融合对欧盟和北约各国的长期能源安全战略将产生至关重要的影响。
Anchoring these countries to the West will not be easy.	把这些国家纳入西方的体系并不简单。
Whether the end result is better relations or full integration of these countries into the EU and NATO is an open question.	最终结果到底是改善关系还是加入欧盟或北约还不得而知。
But both organizations need to reach out to these countries, a process that should be seen as the next phase in completing the wider Europe.	但欧盟和北约必须对黑海国家伸出双手，这是实现大欧洲计划下一阶段必不可少的一个过程。
What should a new bold yet realistic EU and NATO outreach strategy for the Black Sea region look like?	对欧盟和北约的黑海扩张大胆却又现实的估计是什么？
Clearly, the region's countries are weaker and further behind previous candidates for Western integration.	显而易见，该地区国家国力较弱，比起从前融入西方社会的国家也是如此。
But the good news is that the EU and NATO are much better positioned to develop an ambitious strategy than they were vis-à-vis Central and Eastern Europe a decade ago.	但有利的一面是，与10年前吸纳中东欧国家入盟时相比，欧盟和北约能够更好地执行扩张的宏图大略。
If the EU and NATO decide to launch a bold outreach strategy for the region, they will be able to draw on existing tools, conceptual talent, and practical experience.	如果欧盟和北约决意采用大胆地扩张战略，他们将可以利用现有的工具、理念和实践经验。
For example, NATO already has three members - Bulgaria, Romania, and Turkey - bordering the Black Sea.	举例来讲，北约已经有保加利亚、罗马尼亚和土耳其三个成员国临近黑海。
As for the EU, the candidacies of Romania and Bulgaria need to be concluded successfully, together with the issue of Turkey's membership aspirations.	而对欧盟来讲，先要成功解决罗马尼亚和保加利亚的资格问题，然后才谈得上土耳其。
An EU that includes Sofia and Bucharest, and that is on track with Ankara, will be well positioned to engage the wider region.	吸纳了索非亚和布加勒斯特之后，安卡拉会谈如果再走上正轨，欧盟就能为进一步扩张获取足够的资本。
The EU also needs to put meat on the bones of its new Neighborhood Policy, while NATO must apply new mechanisms for strengthening ties with the region.	欧盟还要进一步细化新的睦邻政策，而北约则要采纳与该地区加强关系的新机制。
As opposed to a 100- or 200-meter sprint, both organizations need to think more in terms of a much longer race, perhaps a marathon.	对两个组织来讲，这都不是什么100或200米短跑，而需要付出长期、甚至是马拉松般的努力。
If countries in the region embrace the idea, a network of current EU and NATO members could step forward with projects and assistance aimed at promoting a Black Sea identity and community.	如果上述想法能够为该地区各国所接受，那么现有的欧盟和北约成员国就可以开始进一步合作，以推动成立黑海国家共同体。
Recent events in Georgia remind us that resolving the region's "frozen conflicts"- i.e., those in the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, of Transdneistria in Moldova, and Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan - must be a priority.	最近发生在格鲁吉亚的事件提醒我们：必须先铲除该地区"根深蒂固的矛盾 " － 也就是南奥塞梯和阿布哈兹、摩尔多瓦托斯德尼查、阿塞拜疆纳哥诺-卡拉巴赫的分离主义势力。
In reality, these conflicts are not frozen; they are festering wounds that breed corruption and organized crime.	事实上，这些冲突不仅没有被"冻结 " ， 还像伤口一样迅速溃烂，成了滋生腐败和有组织犯罪的温床。
They inhibit democratization and incite instability.	它们制约了民主，引发了动荡。
While these conflicts involve historical grievances, outside actors - particularly Russia - contribute to their lack of resolution, which is essential for successful reform.	因为这些冲突牵扯到很多历史问题，外来势力－特别是俄国的介入－使它们的解决难上加难，但解决这些遗留问题却是改革成功不可缺少的前提。
So far, neither America nor Europe has made these conflicts a top priority.	到目前为止，美国和欧洲都还没有把化解冲突列为今后工作的重点。
Resolving these semi-dormant wars requires stepped-up political involvement, economic engagement, and a willingness to provide Western peacekeeping forces and monitors if and when they are needed.	我们需要在政治上更多介入、在经济上更多支持和在必要时派出西方维和部队进行监管，才能使这场处于半休眠状态的战争消弭于无形。
But the long-term peace and stability needed to advance economic and political reform in the region will also require either a change in Russian behavior or a reduction in Russian influence.	但推动该地区经济和政治改革所需的长期的和平与稳定还需要改变俄国的行为方式、或削弱俄国的影响。
The experience of the last decade suggests that a policy of engaging the Kremlin intensely while protecting fundamental Western interests may be the best way to proceed.	10年前的经验表明：在与克里姆林宫密切合作的同时保护西方的根本利益，也许是继往开来的最佳途径。
Developing a new Euro-Atlantic strategy for the Black Sea region must start with the democracies of North America and Europe recognizing their moral and political stake in the outcome.	要想制定黑海地区新的欧洲－大西洋战略，北美和欧洲必须先认可黑海诸国的道德和政治权益。
Projecting stability and security in these countries is the next logical step in building a Europe "whole and free" and securing the Euro-Atlantic community's eastern frontier with the Middle East.	下一步是预先规划好地区的安全和稳定，然后再建设一个"完整自由"的欧洲，确保欧洲－大西洋共同体与中东边界线的安全。
This task will be as important over the next decade as integrating Central and Eastern Europe into the West was in the 1990's.	今后10年内这项任务的意义绝不亚于20世纪90年代中东欧国家与西方的融合。
	
The Despotic Temptation	专制的诱惑
MADRID – US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, when asked about American support for the notorious Nicaraguan despot Anastasio Somoza, purportedly replied, “He may be a son of a bitch, but he’s our son of a bitch.”	马德里 — — 据称美国总统富兰克林·罗斯福在被问及美国是否支持臭名昭著的尼加拉瓜暴君索莫查时回答说 ， “ 他或许是个恶棍，但却是我们的恶棍 。 ”
Whether or not the quip is apocryphal, it sums up a longstanding Western approach to much of the world – and one that underpinned US foreign policy throughout the Cold War.	无论杜撰与否，这则轶事都准确地总结了西方国家对世界的态度 — — 上述态度奠定了冷战时期美国外交政策的基础。
But lately an even more troubling sentiment seems to have emerged, with Western leaders willing to settle not for “our son of a bitch,” but for just about any son of a bitch who can impose stability, whatever the cost.	但近来出现了一种更令人不安的情绪，即西方领导人不仅满足于“我们的恶棍 ” ， 而且满足于任何能稳定局势的恶棍，而不管会因此付出多大的代价。
It is an alluring but dangerous mindset.	这是一种颇具诱惑力但却危险的心态。
Experience should have pushed Western leaders in the opposite direction.	经验本该推动西方领导人走向相反的方向。
After all, as time passed, the ostensibly pragmatic clientelism of the Cold War proved far from ideal.	毕竟，随着时间的推移，事实证明貌似务实的冷战庇护主义其实远远不够理想。
Indeed, in many cases – the Shah of Iran, Cambodia’s Lon Nol, Chile’s Augusto Pinochet, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s Mobutu Sese Seko, to name a few – it led to long-term insecurity and disorder.	事实上，在很多情况下 — — 比如伊朗国王，柬埔寨的朗诺，智利的奥古斯托·皮诺切特和刚果民主共和国的蒙博托 — — 冷战庇护主义都造成了长期动荡和混乱的后果。
But these are desperate times.	但现在是绝望的时刻。
Unable to contain the violence, suffering, and chaos engulfing the Middle East and North Africa – the consequences of which are increasingly being felt in Europe – Western leaders are falling back into the Cold War trap.	因为无法遏制席卷中东和北非的暴力、痛苦和混乱 — — 欧盟能越来越明显地感觉到上述后果 — — 西方领导人正再度陷入冷战陷阱之中。
All they want is for someone – and now virtually anyone – to enforce order.	他们只希望有人 — — 现在几乎是任何人 — — 来稳定秩序。
This desperation is perhaps most apparent in Syria.	这种绝望也许在叙利亚最为显著。
After years of insisting that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was the problem, a growing number of Western policymakers and strategists are now suggesting that he may actually be part of the solution – or at least the transition.	西方多年来一直坚持叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德是问题所在，但现在却有越来越多的西方决策者和战略家将其视为解决方案 — — 或至少是过渡方案的组成部分。
Last month, German Chancellor Angela Merkel noted the necessity of including Assad in talks about Syria’s future.	上个月，德国总理默克尔强调必须让阿萨德参与叙利亚未来谈判。
Likewise, both US Secretary of State John Kerry and British Prime Minister David Cameron now concede a role for Assad in a hypothetical transition.	同样，美国国务卿克里和英国首相卡梅伦现在承认阿萨德要在假设的过渡中扮演一定的角色。
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy went so far as to say that the world had to “count on” Assad in the fight against the Islamic State.	西班牙首相拉霍伊甚至表示世界必须“依靠”阿萨德打击伊斯兰国。
Whether driven by realism or resignation, this shift reflects a distinct desire for stability – a desire that is reinforced, especially in Europe, by the presence of another governance black hole in Libya.	无论出于现实主义还是心灰意冷，上述转变都反映了一种对稳定的渴望：尤其在欧洲，利比亚的另一个治理黑洞强化了这种愿望。
The same desire has already driven the West to support Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s regime in Egypt – despite its dubious origins and continuing repression – with only the slightest of pressure for reform.	同样的愿望已推动西方支持埃及的塞西政权 — — 西方仅对其施加了轻微的改革压力，尽管该政权来源可疑且持续镇压民众。
When confronted with anarchy, this eagerness to secure stability by whatever means necessary is understandable.	面对无政府状态时，这种不惜采取任何必要手段确保稳定的急切愿望是可以理解的。
But it is a slippery slope.	但这是个危险的斜坡。
And, in fact, it is based on a false dichotomy between autocracy and instability.	而且实际上基于专制和动荡错误的二分法。
Of course, autocratic figures like Russian President Vladimir Putin have a strong interest in promoting this dichotomy.	当然，像俄罗斯总统普京这样的专制人物对推动这样的二分法兴趣浓厚。
As the Bulgarian political analyst Ivan Krastev recently noted, Putin – a long-time ally of Assad – is doing his best to promote the idea that Western efforts to promote good governance lead only to volatility.	保加利亚政治分析家克拉斯杰夫最近指出，阿萨德的长期盟友普京正竭力宣传西方促进良好治理的努力所换来只有动荡。
“Rather than bringing about reforms,” Putin declared in a recent address to the UN General Assembly, “aggressive foreign interference has resulted in…violence, poverty, and social disaster.”	普京在面向联合国大会的最近一次讲话中说 ， “ 激进的外交干预不仅没能带来改革，反而引发了暴力、贫困和社会灾难 。 ”
A strong Assad-led government, the logic goes, would have the opposite effect – a point that Russia is now trying to prove on the ground in Syria.	俄国试图在叙利亚战场上证明，按照这样的逻辑，阿萨德领导的强势政府能够带来相反的效果。
However compelling this idea might be, and however weary the West feels, the reality, demonstrated starkly during the Cold War and its bloody aftermath, is that tyranny is never genuinely stable – certainly not in the long run.	无论这种想法看似多么可信，也无论西方如何感到疲惫，冷战及其血腥后果所展示的赤裸裸的现实是从长期来看，专制从来不可能带来真正稳定的结果。
The desire for human dignity and respect – the cornerstones of good governance – cannot be quelled, especially at a time when people have unprecedented access to information through the Internet and mobile technologies.	特别是在人们前所未有地通过互联网和移动技术了解信息的当下，人类对尊严和尊重的渴望 — — 也是善政的基础 — — 根本不可能被压制住。
So good governance is the key to long-term stability.	因此善政是长期稳定的关键。
But, like stability, good governance cannot be imposed from the outside; rather, it must develop organically, supported by sturdy roots within a society.	但善政和稳定一样无法从外部强加；而是必须从内部滋长，在国内社会树立牢固的根源。
This does not mean that there is nothing Western governments can do.	这并不是说西方政府无事可做。
On the contrary, by helping to cultivate a strong civil society at the local and national levels, external forces can play an important role in creating a strong foundation for good governance in crisis-stricken countries.	相反，外部力量可以通过在地方和国家层面上协助培育强大的民间机构，从而在危机国家创建牢固的善政基础方面发挥重要作用。
The Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet – the group of civil-society organizations that was awarded this year’s Nobel Peace Prize for its “decisive contribution” to democracy after the country’s 2011 revolution – has shown just how effective a strong civil society can be in supporting stability.	2011年突尼斯革命后因对民主做出“决定性贡献”而被授予今年诺贝尔和平奖的民间组织突尼斯全国对话四方机构已经向世人证明强大的民间组织可以如何有效地支持稳定工作。
To make a real difference in stabilizing today’s most tumultuous regions, the international community should hold Tunisia up as a model (and remain committed to ensuring that it continues on the path toward stable democracy), rather than falling prey to Putin’s cautionary fables about Syria and Libya.	要想在稳定当前最动荡地区的工作中真正发挥作用，国际社会应该将突尼斯引为榜样（并确保其沿着稳定的民主道路继续前进 ） ， 而不是成为继普京叙利亚和利比亚警世寓言之后的又一个牺牲者。
Unfortunately, Western leaders have repeatedly shown that they lack the patience and dedication needed to engage consistently and humbly with communities in crisis-stricken countries or to provide the reliable, incremental, and prolonged governance assistance needed to prevent state collapse.	不幸的是，西方领导人一再证明他们缺乏怀着谦逊之心与危机国家社会持续接触的耐心和奉献精神，也无力提供防止国家崩溃所需的可靠、渐进和长期的治理援助。
With their short attention spans and heightened sense of their own importance, they prefer the option of simply installing a despot to deal with it.	因为西方自视甚高且集中注意力的时间非常有限，他们更愿意扶植独裁者完成治理国家的任务。
They need to get over themselves – for everyone’s sake.	为了所有人的利益，他们必须克服自己的短处。
	
The Politics of Islamophobia	伊斯兰恐惧症的政治学
NEW YORK – There are many roads to political disaster: greed, hubris, the charisma of the demagogue, and, perhaps most dangerous of all, fear.	纽约—可谓条条大路通政治灾难：贪婪、狂妄、魅力超凡又蛊惑人心的政客，但也许最危险的是恐惧。
When people panic, they can become hysterical, and hysteria often leads to mass violence.	当人们开始恐慌时，他们会变得歇斯底里，而歇斯底里常常导致群体暴力。
When politicians convince people that they are in a life-or-death battle – that survival is a matter of “us or them” – anything becomes possible.	当政客让人们相信，他们到了“最危险的时候 ” — —生存成为一件“我们还是他们”的事 — — 任何事情都可能发生。
Adolf Hitler combined all the elements of political catastrophe: hubris, charisma, greed, and the idea that “Aryans” and Jews were locked in a struggle for survival.	希特勒就集中了所有政治灾难的要素：狂妄、魅力超凡、贪婪，以及“雅利安人”和犹太人已经进入你死我亡的生存斗争状态的概念。
Of course, none of the demagogues in the West today – from Donald Trump in the United States to Marine Le Pen or Geert Wilders in Europe – are comparable to Hitler.	当然，如今，蛊惑人心的西方政客 — — 从美国的唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）到欧洲的马琳·勒庞（Marine Le Pen）或吉尔特·怀德斯（Geert Wilders ） — —都无法与希特勒相提并论。
None has promoted dictatorship, let alone mass murder.	没有一个人宣扬独裁，更不用说大屠杀了。
But they are definitely stirring up the politics of fear.	但他们显然都在煽动恐慌政治。
Trump, for one, also promotes greed, openly boasting of his wealth, and has somehow refined outlandish hubris and contradictory posturing into a bizarre form of charisma.	其中，特朗普也在煽动贪婪，公开炫耀他的财富，并将古怪的狂妄和矛盾的姿态融合为一种奇异的魅力。
On the one hand, he promises to fix all the world’s problems, and to show China, Russia, the Islamic State, or anyone else who is boss.	一方面，他承诺要解决世界上所有问题，让中国、俄罗斯、伊斯兰国和其他所有人知道谁才是“老板 ” 。
On the other hand, he claims that his vast and powerful country cannot take in desperate refugees from Syria, because, he warns, Muslim asylum-seekers might stage “one of the great military coups of all time.”	另一方面，他宣称他的广袤而强大的祖国不能接受绝望的叙利亚难民，因为，他警告说，寻求庇护的穆斯林可能“在酝酿有史以来最大的军事政变 ” 。
Trump’s Republican colleagues in the race for the US presidency, such as Ted Cruz, Ben Carson, and Marco Rubio, stoke similar fears about refugees.	特朗普的共和党美国总统竞选对手同志 — — 如泰德·科鲁兹（Ted Cruz ） 、 本·卡尔森（Ben Carson）和马克·卢比奥（Marco Rubio ） — —也在煽动类似的难民恐惧。
Cruz, as well as the supposedly more moderate Jeb Bush, even suggested that only Christians should be allowed into the US.	科鲁兹，以及理应更加温和的杰布·布什，甚至建议美国只允许基督徒进入。
More than 10,000 people are killed every year by gun violence in the US – all but a handful for reasons having nothing to do with Islam.	在美国，每年有10,000多人死于枪支暴力 — — 其中只有极少数与伊斯兰教有关。
And yet all of the Republican candidates are proud of opposing gun-control measures; indeed, they have no problem allowing people to enter a school or a bar bearing concealed weapons.	但所有共和党候选人都以反对枪支管制措施为豪；事实上，对于允许人们深藏武器进入学校或酒吧，他们一点问题都没有。
But even a relative handful of Muslim refugees is too dangerous to contemplate.	但一小撮穆斯林难民对他们来说却过于危险，根本不予考虑。
This is not to say that terrible acts of Islamist terror could not happen in the US, or elsewhere.	这并不是说美国或其他地区不可能发生伊斯兰恐怖袭击。
They have, and there probably will be more of them, so long as the Middle East remains in turmoil and revolutionary Islam appeals to disaffected Western youth.	这种袭击早已发生过，并且未来也许还会更多，如果中东继续动荡、伊斯兰革命继续吸引心怀不满的西方青年的话。
But it is hardly an existential threat.	但这绝非生存威胁。
An American friend of mine speculated that, “We might be one terrorist act away from a Trump presidency.”	我的一位美国朋友猜测 ， “ 我们距离特朗普当总统大概也就相差一次恐怖行动 。 ”
A spectacular murder spree by Islamists could spook Americans enough to vote for the greatest fear-monger.	如果伊斯兰教徒进行一次大凶杀，便可能让吓坏了的美国人选出散播恐惧最力的候选人。
Anything is possible, but I don’t believe American voters would be that stupid.	一切都有可能，但我不相信美国选民有那么蠢。
The greater danger is, however, that the demagogues will drive even mainstream politicians into their camp.	但是，更大的危险是蛊惑人心的政客甚至会导致主流政客加入他们的阵营。
Since the November 13 terror attacks in Paris, François Hollande, the unpopular but altogether sensible French president, has been so afraid of being labeled a weakling by politicians of the right and far right that he has declared a national state of emergency – and war on the Islamic State (ISIS).	11月13日巴黎恐怖袭击以来，尽管支持率不高但十分明智的法国总统奥朗德生怕被右翼和极右翼政客贴上怯懦的标签，宣布法国进入紧急状态，并向伊斯兰国宣战。
As long as France’s state of emergency lasts, police may arrest people without warrants, break down the doors of private residences in the middle of the night, take over restaurants and other public places with armed force, and generally behave like agents in a police state.	只要法国保持紧急状态，警察就可以不经许可抓人，可以半夜破门进入私宅，可以动用武力搜查餐厅和其他公共场所，可以像警察国家的特工那样行动。
Most French citizens are now so frightened of Islamist attacks that such measures are widely supported.	目前，大部分法国公民因为伊斯兰袭击而胆战心惊，因此这些措施受到了广泛支持。
But they are almost certainly counter-productive.	但它们几乎肯定将适得其反。
A national leader can declare war on a state, not on a network of revolutionaries.	国家领导人可以对一个国家宣战，但无法向一个革命者网络宣战。
ISIS, despite its claims, is not a state, and Hollande should not treat it as one.	伊斯兰国不是一个国家（尽管它自称是一个国家 ） ， 奥朗德也不应该把它当一个国家对待。
Besides, even if bombing ISIS strongholds in Iraq or Syria makes military sense, it won’t break the spell of Islamist revolution for frustrated, bored, and marginalized young people in French slums.	此外，尽管轰炸伊拉克和叙利亚伊斯兰国据点有军事上���意义，但并不能摧毁伊斯兰革命对法国贫民窟的沮丧、无聊和边缘化青年的吸引力。
On the contrary: The canny leaders of ISIS also rely on an apocalyptic “us or them” view of the world.	情况正好相反：伊斯兰国的精明领导人也依靠启示录式的“我们或他们”世界观。
Most Muslims are not violent revolutionaries who condone, let alone admire, mass violence.	大部分穆斯林都不是容忍甚至崇尚群众暴力的暴力革命者。
ISIS seeks to broaden its support, especially among young Muslims, by convincing them that true Muslims are in an existential war with the West – that the infidels are their mortal enemies. For them no less than for Trump, fear is the most powerful weapon.	伊斯兰国试图通过让他们相信真正的穆斯林正在与西方进行一场生存战争、异教徒就是他们的死敌来扩大其支持面，特别是年轻穆斯林中的支持面。
So the more a Western government allows its policemen to humiliate and bully Muslims in the name of security, the more ISIS is likely to win European recruits.	因此，更多西方政府允许警察以安全名义羞辱和迫害穆斯林，伊斯兰国就越容易在欧洲招到人手。
The only way to combat revolutionary Islamist violence is to gain the trust of law-abiding Muslims in the West.	打击革命伊斯兰暴力的唯一办法是赢得西方守法穆斯林的信任。
This will not be easy, but arbitrary arrests are surely the wrong way to go about it.	这绝非易事，但肆意逮捕显然是错误的方法。
Likewise, when it comes to civil wars in the Middle East, Western restraint is usually a better strategy than hasty military intervention driven by domestic fear.	类似地，对于中东内战，西方的约束常常是比出于国内恐惧而进行仓促的军事干预更好的策略。
Republican candidates in the US are already using the recent murder spree in Paris to blame President Barack Obama, and by extension any future Democratic candidate, for being weak.	美国共和党候选人已开始利用最近的巴黎大谋杀指责总统奥巴马 — — 并将指责对象扩大到所有未来民主党候选人 — — 表现软弱。
Trump has promised to “bomb the shit out of ISIS.”	特朗普承诺要“把伊斯兰国炸出屎来 ” 。
This bellicosity has had the effect of pushing Hillary Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, into distancing herself from Obama.	如此好斗的结果是让在民主党候选人提名竞争中领先的希拉里·克林顿与奥巴马撇清界线。
Like Hollande, she has to assuage public fear by talking tough and promising more military action.	和奥朗德一样，她必须通过强硬表态和承诺增加军事行动平息公共恐慌。
Obama has consistently resisted the temptation to unleash more wars.	奥巴马一直在抵制发动更多战争的诱惑。
His policies have sometimes been inconsistent and irresolute.	他的政策有时前后矛盾、犹豫不决。
But in his refusal to give in to panic and act rashly, he has been far braver than all the big talkers who accuse him of being a wimp.	但他拒绝屈服于恐慌、轻率行事，在这一点上，他比指责他是懦夫的“嘴炮”更加勇敢。
	
The Inconvenient Truth About Saudi Arabia	难以忽视的沙特真相
NEW YORK – The 2006 documentary “An Inconvenient Truth” highlights former US Vice President Al Gore’s efforts to alert his fellow Americans to the perils of global warming.	发自纽约 — — 2006年的纪录片《难以忽视的真相》彰显出了美国前副总统戈尔为警告自己的同胞注意全球变暖风险而做出的努力。
What made the truth inconvenient is that avoiding catastrophic climate change would require people to live differently and, in some cases, give up what they love (such as gas-guzzling cars).	而让真相如此难以忽视的原因则在于避免灾难性的气候变化将要求人们去改变自己的生活方式，甚至在某些情况下放弃自己的心爱之物（比如大排量汽车 ） 。
For nearly two months, we have all been living with another inconvenient truth – ever since Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist working for The Washington Post and living in the United States, disappeared after entering Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Istanbul.	而近两个月来，我们一直生活在另一个难以忽视的真相之中 — — 自从为《华盛顿邮报》工作并居住在美国的沙特记者贾迈勒·卡舒吉（Jamal Khashoggi）在进入沙特驻伊斯坦布尔领事馆后失踪后。
A large part of the truth is undeniable: Khashoggi was murdered by individuals with close ties to the Saudi government and its de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (widely known as MBS).	很大一部分事实是无可否认的：卡舒吉是被与沙特政府及其事实上的领导人，王储穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼（Mohammed bin Salman）关系密切的个人杀害的。
Weeks of official Saudi denials and lies only reinforced the conclusion – now also the reported judgment of the CIA – that the murder was premeditated and approved at the top.	沙特官方几周以来的否认和谎言都只是强化了这一结论（据报也是美国中情局的判断 ） ， 那就是这起谋杀是有预谋并获得沙特高层批准的。
MBS’s direct role may not be 100% proven, but most observers familiar with Saudi Arabia harbor little doubt.	王储在此事件中所直接扮演的角色虽然无法得到100％的证实，但大多数熟悉沙特的观察家们都不会怀疑。
This is not a system that tolerates much freelancing.	须知沙特的体制可不太能容下这类不受控制的人。
What makes the truth inconvenient is Saudi Arabia’s strategic importance.	而使真相无可忽视之处还在于沙特阿拉伯的战略重要性。
The Kingdom still accounts for over 10% of global oil output.	该国仍占据全球石油产量的10％以上。
Its sovereign wealth fund sits on an estimated $500 billion.	其主权财富基金规模估计达5000亿美元。
Saudi Arabia is the most influential Sunni Arab country, occupying a special role within the Muslim world, owing to its role as the custodian of Islam’s holiest sites.	它是最具影响力的逊尼派阿拉伯国家，作为伊斯兰教多个最神圣地点的监护者在穆斯林世界中扮演着特殊的角色。
It is central to any policy of confronting Iran.	同时沙特也是任何对抗伊朗政策的核心。
Moreover, MBS, for all his faults, is something of a reformer, understanding that his country must open up and diversify if it is to thrive and the royal family is to survive.	此外王储萨勒曼尽管有诸多缺点，但依然算是个改革者，知道自己国家的繁荣和王室的生存离不开开放和多元化。
He is also popular at home, especially with younger Saudis, who constitute the bulk of the population.	他本人在国内也颇受欢迎，尤其是在占人口大多数的沙特年轻人中很有威望。
The problem is that the faults of the young and impulsive Crown Prince are many.	但问题在于这位年轻和冲动王储的缺点真是相当多。
In addition to his role in the murder of Khashoggi, he recklessly ordered the Saudi attack on Yemen that triggered his country’s equivalent of the US war in Vietnam – a strategic and humanitarian catastrophe.	除了卡舒吉谋杀案中的作用之外，他还鲁莽地下令沙特出兵也门，导致自己的国家陷入了类似美国越南战争的境地 — — 一场战略和人道主义的灾难。
He kidnapped the Lebanese prime minister, did all he could to undermine Qatar, arrested wealthy Saudis who refused to embrace his consolidation of power, froze diplomatic relations with Canada over a critical tweet, and imprisoned political activists, including women seeking greater rights.	他绑架了黎巴嫩总理，想尽办法去打压卡塔尔，逮捕了一批拒绝接受其权力巩固措施的沙特富豪，因为一条批评性推文就冻结了与加拿大的外交关系，还监禁了一批政治活动分子，包括那些试图争取更多权利的妇女。
The Saudi strategy for dealing with the outcry over Khashoggi’s murder is clear: hunker down and weather the storm.	沙特对卡舒吉谋杀案所引发的强烈抗议的处理策略很明确：就地卧倒，熬过冲击。
MBS and his inner circle are calculating that the world’s outrage will fade, given their country’s importance.	鉴于本国的重要性，王储和他的核心圈子都算计说全世界的愤怒将会消退。
He has good reason to believe that other Sunni Arab states will stand by him, given the subsidies he provides.	在他所提供的丰厚补贴之下，他有充分的理由相信其他逊尼派阿拉伯国家会站在他这边。
Israel, too, has indicated support for MBS, owing to his willingness to move in the direction of normalizing relations and, more important, the two countries’ shared interest in countering Iranian influence in the region.	以色列也表示会支持王储，因为他愿意朝着关系正常化的方向前进，更重要的是两国在打击伊朗在该地区影响力方面有着共同的利益。
And US President Donald Trump’s administration is standing by its man, so far refusing to acknowledge his role in Khashoggi’s murder and resisting calls for sanctions against Saudi Arabia.	美国总统特朗普的政府也愿意为他出面，至今依然拒绝承认他在卡舒吉谋杀中的作用并拒绝如外界所呼吁的那样对沙特实施制裁。
What, then, should be done?	那么究竟该做些什么？
Former US Secretary of State James A. Baker recently drew a parallel to US policy toward China in 1989, at the time of the massacre of protesting students in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square.	美国前国务卿詹姆斯·贝克（James A. Baker）最近将此事件与1989年北京天安门广场屠杀学生时的对华政策画上了等号。
George H.W. Bush’s administration (of which I was a part) worked hard to thread the needle: introducing sanctions to convey displeasure with the Chinese government, but limiting the punishment and keeping lines of communication open, given China’s importance.	老布什政府（本人也是其中一员）的任务非常艰巨：一方面要实施制裁以表达对中国政府的不满，另一方面鉴于中国的重要性，又得限制惩罚力度并保持沟通渠道畅通。
Would a similar policy toward Saudi Arabia prove viable?	那么针对沙特的类似政策是否可行？
Ideally, the US and European governments would let it be known that they would be more open to working with Saudi Arabia if the power of the Crown Prince were reduced.	在理想状态下，欧美各国政府会公开宣称如果王储能削减其权力，那么它们也会更愿意与沙特合作。
There should also be limits on US arms sales and intelligence support, which, fortunately, the US Congress is likely to impose.	来自美国军售和情报支持也应该会受到限制，幸运的是美国国会很可能实施这一点。
But more important than any sanction would be ratcheting up public and private pressure on MBS regarding what is needed and what needs to be avoided.	但比任何制裁都更重要的是去增大王储所承受的公共和私人压力，让他知道需要做什么以及需要避免什么。
What is needed is a concerted push to end the Yemen conflict. What needs to be avoided is exploitation of the Trump administration’s anti-Iran animus to provoke an armed confrontation that would force others to overcome their qualms and side with Saudi Arabia.	我们需要的是齐心协力结束也门冲突，需要避免的是利用特朗普政府的反伊朗敌意来挑起武装对抗，迫使其他人放弃顾虑加入沙特一方。
A war with Iran would be costly and dangerous.	一场与伊朗的战争将是昂贵而危险的。
MBS should be made to understand that the US will be a strategic partner for Saudi Arabia only if he acts with greater restraint in Yemen and elsewhere, and with greater respect for US interests.	应该让王储知道美国只有在他在也门和其他地方表现出更大克制且更加尊重美国利益时才会成为其战略伙伴。
Consultations should also be held with China and Russia.	此外还应与中国和俄罗斯进行磋商。
Unlike the US, both have working relationships with Saudi Arabia and Iran, which gives both a stake in preventing such a war from starting and shutting it down quickly if it does.	与美国不同的是这两国都分别与沙特和伊朗建立了合作关系，这既可以从一开始防止这么一场战争，就算战争爆发也可以迅速将其掐灭。
All too often in the Middle East, a bad situation becomes a worse situation.	无奈一个坏情况变得更糟的状况在中东可谓层出不穷。
MBS has created a bad situation. The aim should be to establish sufficient limits so that it does not become worse.	沙特王储已经创造了一个糟糕的局面，而各界的目标应该是建立足够的限制，好使其不会继续恶化下去。
	
Decolonizing Western Sahara	西撒哈拉地区去殖民化
BIR LEHLU, WESTERN SAHARA – When Western Sahara was annexed by Morocco in 1975, it had been under Spanish control for nearly a century.	西撒哈拉贝尔鲁鲁 — — 1975年西撒哈拉被摩洛哥吞并时，此前近一个世纪都处在西班牙的统治之下。
But Spain’s grip on the territory had weakened in the dying days of Francisco Franco’s dictatorship.	但在弗朗西斯科·弗朗哥独裁统治期的末尾，西班牙对该地区的控制似乎有所削弱。
And rather than allowing a process of decolonization, Spain signed the tripartite “Madrid Accords” with Morocco and Mauritania, both of which subsequently moved in to annex the territory.	但西班牙并没有坐视去殖民化进程，而是与摩洛哥和毛里塔尼亚签署了三方“马德里协议 ” ， 之后两国都派兵进驻吞并西撒哈拉。
Mauritania relinquished its claim in 1979, but Morocco never left.	1979年，毛里塔尼亚放弃了这一诉求，但摩洛哥却从未离开过。
Western Sahara’s legal status is crystal clear.	西撒哈拉的法律地位是非常明确的。
In 1963, it was officially recognized as a Non-Self-Governing Territory by the United Nations General Assembly under the UN Charter – a legal status it retains to this day.	1963年，联合国大会根据联合国宪章的规定正式承认其为非自治领土 — — 这是一直保留至今的一种法律地位。
It is, in short, the last colony in Africa.	简言之，西撒哈拉是非洲最后一块殖民地。
In 1975, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) affirmed the Saharawi people’s right to self-determination, and found no ties of territorial sovereignty between Morocco and Western Sahara.	1975年，国际法院（ICJ）确认了撒哈拉民众的自决权，同时不承认摩洛哥和西撒哈拉领土主权之间是有联系的。
Yet Morocco has been allowed to continue illegally occupying Western Sahara for over four decades.	但40多年来联合国一直允许摩洛哥继续非法占领西撒哈拉。
And, as is often the case with unwanted occupations, Morocco has asserted its territorial claim through cruel repression, the systematic denial of basic human rights, and attempts to force demographic change – all while plundering Western Sahara’s natural resources.	而且，向其他不受欢迎的占领一样，摩洛哥一直通过残酷的镇压来宣示其领土主张，有计划的剥夺基本人权并试图强制推行人口变化 — — 同时对西撒哈拉的自然资源展开掠夺。
The Polisario Front fought a war with Morocco until 1991, when the UN brokered a ceasefire agreement.	波利萨里奥阵线与摩洛哥的战争持续到1991年，而后在联合国的调停下停火协议签署。
That deal was supposed to set the stage for a referendum on independence in Western Sahara the following year – a democratic solution.	协议签署后，本应在第二年就西撒哈拉独立问题举行全民公投 — — 这是一个民主的解决办法。
But Morocco has prevented it from ever taking place.	但那次公投被摩洛哥阻止了。
Morocco has also repeatedly obstructed progress toward further negotiations.	摩洛哥还一再阻挠举行进一步谈判。
It has done so in defiance of the UN Security Council, even going so far as to bar the UN’s special envoy from travelling to the region to set the stage for talks.	这样做完全违背联合国安理会的意愿，甚至猖獗到阻止联合国特使来到西撒哈拉地区进行谈判的准备工作。
At the same time, Morocco’s behavior on the ground – including its repression of the Saharawi people and its illegal exploitation of natural resources – has made reaching a political solution increasingly difficult.	与此同时，摩洛哥在当地的行为 — — 包括镇压撒哈拉民众和非法开采自然资源 — — 已经增加了达成政治解决方案的难度。
In the 42 years of Morocco’s occupation of Western Sahara, we, the Saharawi people, have seen eight American presidents, six UN secretary-generals, and a battery of UN special representatives and personal envoys of the secretary-general come and go.	在摩洛哥占领西撒哈拉的42年期间，我们生活在撒哈拉地区的民众目睹了八位美国总统、六位联合国秘书长、一批联合国特别代表和联合国秘书长的个人特使上上下下。
Through it all, we have maintained our faith in the international community, and in the UN-led political process that was launched in 1991.	但我们一直保持了对国际社会的信任，在联合国主导的1991年政治进程中也是一样。
It is time for that faith to be rewarded.	这种信任现在应当得到回报。
In its latest resolution on Western Sahara this year, the UN Security Council unanimously called for the launch of a new political process and acknowledged that the status quo is not acceptable.	在今年西撒哈拉问题的最新决议中，联合国安理会一致呼吁启动新的政治进程并承认目前的状况是不可接受的。
The Security Council recognizes that this is the best route to achieving decolonization in Western Sahara, protecting human rights, enabling self-determination by the Saharawi people, and setting the stage for long-term stability in the territory.	安理会承认解决问题的最佳途径是实现西撒哈拉去殖民化，保护人权，确保撒哈拉民众拥有自决权并为该地区实现长期稳定奠定基础。
The UN Secretariat, the office of the secretary-general, and the new special envoy for Western Sahara, former German President Horst Köhler, now must work rapidly on creating a mechanism for face-to-face time-bound talks.	联合国秘书长办公室联合国秘书处以及西撒哈拉新任特使前德国总统霍斯特·克勒现在必须加快建立面对面针对性谈判机制的进度。
The progress report that they deliver to the Security Council in six months should establish what that mechanism will be, as well as a timetable for negotiations; it should not just be a record of exploratory efforts.	他们在六个月内向安理会提交的进度报告应当确立相关机制，同时制定谈判时间表；这份报告不应只是记录所做的探索性工作。
In the meantime, we in the Polisario Front will continue to work toward securing the rights of the Saharawi people.	与此同时，我们波利萨里奥阵线将继续推进争取撒哈拉人民权利的工作。
Whereas other countries often fold to Moroccan pressure, for fear of harming trade deals or cooperation over security and migration, the law has proved to be a reliable ally for the people of Western Sahara.	尽管其他国家由于担心损害贸易协议或安全及移民合作往往屈从于摩洛哥的压力，但事实证明法律是西撒哈拉人民的可靠朋友。
It has been particularly effective in pushing back against Morocco’s continued illegal exploitation of natural resources.	在反抗摩洛哥不断非法开采自然资源方面拿起法律武器尤其有效。
This is why we have often turned to the courts when the political process has failed us.	因此政治进程让我们失望时我们往往向法庭求助。
Last December, the European Court of Justice joined the ICJ in stating unequivocally that Morocco has no sovereignty over Western Sahara – a move that could pose a significant challenge to Morocco’s relationship with the European Union.	去年12月，欧洲法院与国际法院联手明确表示摩洛哥对西撒哈拉地区不具有主权 — — 此举严重挑战了摩洛哥与欧盟的关系。
That judgment states clearly that any agreement pertaining to Western Sahara’s natural resources requires the consent of the Saharawi people, who are represented by the Polisario Front, as General Assembly Resolution 34/37 established in 1979.	该判决明确表示任何与西撒哈拉自然资源有关的协议需要得到撒哈拉民众的同意，而波利萨里奥阵线是西撒哈拉民众的代表，就像1979年联大第 34/37号决议所规定的那样。
And the EU is not alone.	而欧盟采取这种做法并非唯一一个。
This past May, the Panamanian authorities detained a Canada-bound ship carrying phosphates that had been illegally mined by a state-owned Moroccan company in occupied Western Sahara.	今年5月，巴拿马当局扣留了一艘载有磷酸盐的驶往加拿大的船只，这艘船上的磷酸盐是由一家国有摩洛哥企业在在西撒哈拉占领区非法开采的。
And South African authorities stopped a New Zealand-bound ship containing 54,000 tons of phosphate rock from Western Sahara.	而南非当局则拦截了一艘载有5，4000吨磷酸盐岩的从西撒哈拉驶往新西兰的船只。
The high court in Port Elizabeth sent the case to trial to determine ownership, and the Polisario Front won a major victory – and ownership of the cargo – when Morocco announced that it would not contest the case.	伊丽莎白港高等法院将此案提交审判以确定所有权，而波利萨里奥阵线取得了重大胜利 — — 货物所有权 — — 同时摩洛哥宣布将不对此案提出申诉。
The exploitation of Western Sahara’s natural resources is not only illegal; it also undermines the prospects for a successful political process.	开发西撒哈拉自然资源不仅非法，而且还破坏了政治进程成功的可能性。
We have no intention of abandoning that process.	我们无意放弃政治进程。
But, if Morocco continues to engage in such activities, we will ensure that its efforts are as costly and cumbersome as possible, both for private companies and state actors.	但如果摩洛哥继续进行这样的活动，我们将确保让该国私营和国营企业付出尽可能多的代价。
We will fight for our rights in every venue available to us, from national courts to the court of international public opinion.	我们将在一切可能的地方争取我们的权利，从国家法院到国际舆论法庭无一遗漏。
Over the last four decades, the UN Security Council has repeatedly proved unwilling or unable to bring Morocco to the negotiating table.	过去40年来，事实一再证明联合国安理会不愿或不能将摩洛哥带到谈判桌上。
We, the people of Western Sahara, hope that this time will be different.	我们西撒哈拉地区的民众希望这一次是不同的。
But, until we know that it is, we will not stand idly by while a hostile occupier tramples on our rights, and pillages our resources.	但直到我们确信这一点之前，我们绝不会袖手旁观地坐视占领者践踏我们的权利、掠夺我们的资源而不采取任何行动。
	
A Future for Western Sahara	西撒哈拉的未来
MADRID – International politics is replete with unresolved territorial disputes, from conflicting claims by China and Japan over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea to the prolonged disagreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh.	马德里—国际政坛充斥着悬而未决的领土纠纷，如中日的东海钓鱼岛之争、亚美尼亚和阿塞拜疆的纳卡地区（Nagorno-Karabakh）的长期纠纷等。
But one such dispute, over Western Sahara, is often overlooked, despite the very real possibility of resolving it.	但西撒哈拉纠纷常常为人所忽视，尽管我们有很大的可能解决它。
With a population of about 600,000 on territory covering roughly 102,700 square miles (266,000 square kilometers), Western Sahara, a Spanish colony until 1975, is the largest of 17 non-self-governing territories listed by the United Nations as having not reached final political status.	西撒哈拉是一片266,000平方公里的土地，人口600,000，在1975年前一直是西班牙殖民地，现在是联合国所列举的17个为取得最终政治地位的非自治领地中最大的一块。
The territory has been in limbo for much of the last four decades, with Morocco and the pro-independence Polisario Front both asserting claims to the territory.	在过去四十年里，该领地一直飘摇不定，摩洛哥和支持独立的波利萨里奥阵线（Polisario Front）都主张对这篇领地的主权。
Morocco controls about 80%; the Polisario Front holds the remaining 20%, on the border with Algeria.	摩洛哥控制了其中的80%左右，波利萨里奥阵线控制了其余20%与阿尔及利亚接壤的地区。
Last month, I visited Western Sahara’s Moroccan-controlled capital, Laayoune – a vibrant and gleaming city born from a dusty Spanish colonial outpost – to examine the sustainability of the operations of OCP Group, on whose international advisory board I serve.	上个月，我访问了摩控西撒哈拉首都拉尤恩（Laayoune ） 。 这是一个充满生机的闪亮城市，脱胎自一个破败的西班牙殖民地前哨站。
OCP Group is a leading phosphate producer, with access to approximately 70% of the world’s phosphate reserves.	我来这里是考察OCP集团项目的可持续性。 OCP集团是全球领先的磷酸盐生产商，开采着全球大约70%的磷酸盐储备，我是其国际顾问委员会成员。
It operates in Western Sahara through its subsidiary Phosboucraa, which represents about 6% of OCP’s business turnover and approximately 1.6% of its phosphate reserves.	它在西撒哈拉通过其子公司Phosboucraa开展业务。 Phosboucraa贡献了OCP大约6%的营业收入和大约1.6%的磷酸盐储备。
My visit focused, first, on measuring the impact of Phosboucraa’s activities, such as infrastructure investment, the construction of job training centers, and partnerships with farming cooperatives.	我的访问重点首先是评估Phosboucraa的活动所造成的影响，如基础设施投资、培训中心的建设，以及农业合作等。
Second, I was to consider how well those activities conform to UN doctrine on natural-resource exploitation in non-self-governing territories – namely, that they benefit the territory and its inhabitants until Western Sahara’s ultimate political status is determined.	其次，我到这里是为了考察这些活动是否遵循联合国的非自治领地自然资源开发指导思想 — — 即，它们要有利于该领地及其居民，直到西撒哈拉的政治地位最终得到确认。
But when might that status be determined?	但政治地位到底什么时候才能确认？
The UN has been trying to broker a resolution since Spain departed the territory, transferring administrative control over Western Sahara to Mauritania and Morocco.	自西班牙离开该领地、将西撒哈拉的行政权移交给毛里塔尼亚和摩洛哥以来，联合国一直在试图调停。
Mauritania left in 1979, leaving Morocco to confront the Polisario Front, which had announced its claims to the territory in the last years of Spanish control.	1979年，毛里塔尼亚退出，西撒哈拉进入摩洛哥和波利萨里奥阵线对峙的时代，后者从西班牙控制时代末期开始主张对该领地的主权。
In 1991, after a 16-year conflict, the UN managed to broker a truce between the two parties, which included an immediate ceasefire.	1991年，在经历了16年的冲突后，联合国成功调停了双方，并实现立刻停火。
Under the auspices of the UN Security Council, negotiations were initiated, with the goal of resolving the conflict and determining the future status not just of Western Sahara, but also of the thousands of refugees in camps in Algeria.	在联合国安理会的斡旋下，双方开启谈判，目标是解决冲突、确定西撒哈拉 — — 以及数千万被收容在阿尔及利亚难民营的难民 — — 的未来命运。
Along the way, there have been some milestones, often marked by the personality of the UN envoy of the moment.	在此期间，谈判取得了几个里程碑 — — 常常带有时任联合国特使的个人印记。
The envoy who had perhaps the greatest impact was former US Secretary of State James Baker, who ushered the process beyond discussion of a referendum on Western Saharan independence – the initial focus of the talks – toward broader, more flexible solutions.	其中影响最大的一个是前美国国务卿詹姆斯·贝克尔（James Baker ） ， 他让和平进程不再局限于此前的谈判焦点 — — 西撒哈拉独立公投，而是转向了更广泛、更灵活的方案。
In 2003, when I was Spain’s foreign minister, I had the opportunity to engage with the most ambitious of Baker’s proposals – the so-called Baker II plan – which envisioned self-rule under a Western Sahara Authority for a period of five years, with a referendum on independence to follow.	2003年我担任西班牙外交部长期间，曾有机会参与到贝克尔最雄心勃勃的方案中，这个所谓的贝克尔II计划着眼于建立一个西撒哈拉权力机构（Western Sahara Authority ） ， 在其领导下，西撒哈拉先自治五年，然后再举行独立公投。
That plan failed, ultimately leading to Baker’s resignation as UN envoy. But the purview of the talks was fundamentally altered (though the Polisario Front has remained focused on a referendum that includes independence as an option).	这一计划以失败告终，并最终导致贝克尔辞任联合国特使，但谈判的界限已经从根本上改变（尽管波利萨里奥阵线仍然抓住将独立作为选项之一的公投不放 ） 。
In 2007, following the suggestion by Baker’s successor to take into account the “political reality” of the situation, the UN Security Council opened a new phase of negotiations without preconditions, aimed at reaching “a mutually acceptable political solution.”	2007年，贝克尔的继任者建议考虑局面的“政治现实 ” ， 根据这项建议，联合国安理会启动了不设先决条件的谈判新阶段，旨在形成“双方都能接受的政治解决方案 ” 。
This approach has endured until the present day, shepherded for the last ten years by the former US diplomat Christopher Ross.	这一方针在前美国外交官克里斯托弗·罗斯（Christopher Ross）的领导下，被贯彻至今。
In March, however, Ross announced his resignation as UN envoy.	但在今年3月，罗斯辞任联合国特使。
The following month, the UN’s new secretary-general, António Guterres, announced his intention to relaunch the process.	4月，联合国新秘书长古特雷斯宣布准备重启谈判进程。
Now that a new UN envoy – former German President Horst Köhler – has been named, there is renewed hope for a breakthrough.	现在，联合国已经任命了新特使 — — 前德国总统科勒，我们又看见了取得突破的曙光。
The shared conviction that there is no alternative to the UN negotiating process is its greatest strength.	我们现在最大的优势是，所有人都认为除了联合国谈判进程之外，没有其他路可走。
But it is also a fragile framework, confronting mounting challenges.	但这也是一个脆弱的框架，面临着艰巨的挑战。
In the last year, a potential flashpoint has emerged in an area called Guerguerat, with the Polisario Front sending forces into a UN buffer zone.	去年，在一个叫作Guerguerat的地区成为新的潜在“火药桶 ” ， 波利萨里奥阵线向联合国缓冲区派遣了武装力量。
Moreover, members of the UN peacekeeping force were expelled, and later readmitted to the territory.	此外，联合国维和部队遭到驱逐，随后又重新进入该领地。
There have also been proceedings before the European Court of Justice on the implementation of commercial agreements between Morocco and the EU in the territory.	欧洲法院也一直在审理摩洛哥和欧盟在该地区的商业合同的执行诉讼。
So this is a moment of great opportunity for the process, but also of great risk.	因此，现在既是谈判进程的大机会，也是它的风险时刻。
In this context, it is worth questioning the Polisario Front’s aggressive new campaign against third parties in the territory.	在这样的环境下，应该质疑波利萨里奥阵线针对领地内第三方的侵犯性新行动。
At the end of April – just a day after the UN Security Council endorsed Guterres’s call to relaunch the negotiation process – the Polisario Front launched a legal challenge in a civil court in South Africa, seeking to seize a shipment of phosphate mined in the territory.	4月底 — — 即联合国安理会支持古特雷斯关于重启谈判进程的提议之后几天 — — 波利萨里奥阵线就向南非民事法庭提起了诉讼，要求扣留一艘装载在该领地进行采掘的磷酸盐的船只。
Days later, a similar challenge was brought in Panama against another ship.	几天后，巴拿马法院也收到了扣留另一条船的诉讼。
The Panamanian court dismissed the action, noting that it was a diplomatic and international question, but the South African matter is ongoing.	巴拿马法院驳回了上诉，指出这是一个外交和国际问题，但南非的案子仍在进行中。
This new tactic of using third-country civil courts to hurt Morocco will only undermine the UN process.	这一利用第三国民事法庭伤害摩洛哥的新策略将破坏联合国谈判进程。
A solution to the Western Saharan conflict can be reached only if all parties involved – especially Morocco and the Polisario Front, but also neighboring countries, particularly Algeria – commit to do so.	西撒哈拉要想形成解决冲突的方案，涉及各方 — — 特别是摩洛哥和波利萨里奥阵线，但也包括邻国特别是阿尔及利亚 — — 都必须竭尽全力。
In fact, the entire international community has a stake in the success of the UN process – and a responsibility to do everything possible to bring it about.	事实上，整个国际社会都将因为联合国谈判进程的成功而受益 — — 因此也有责任尽其所能使进程获得成功。
	
The West’s Decadent Foreign Policy	颓废的西方外交政策
LONDON – Nowadays, the West can be described as decadent.	伦敦 — — 可以用颓废来形容现在的西方。
That does not mean simply that we are addicted to “bread and circuses,” from welfare programs in Europe (which we can barely afford) to the Super Bowl in the United States. It means also that we are increasingly reluctant to allow our own vision of civil liberties and human rights to shape our foreign policies, owing to the potential commercial costs.	这不仅意味着我们沉迷于欧洲福利计划的“小恩小惠 ” （ 其实我们已经难以负担相关的开销）和美国的超级碗，还意味着因为潜在的商业成本，我们越来越不愿意让公民自由和人权观来决定自己的外交政策。
Consider the case of the Chinese dissident and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, who recently died while serving an 11-year prison sentence for calling for democracy in China.	以中国持不同政见者及诺贝尔和平奖得主刘晓波为例，他因为呼吁中国实行民主制度不久前在服刑11年期间死于狱中。
The Chinese authorities refused Liu’s request, made just weeks before his death, to seek treatment abroad for his aggressive cancer, and his wife remains under house arrest.	中国政府拒绝了刘在死前几周所提出的到国外治疗癌症的请求，而他的妻子依然被软禁。
China’s treatment of dissidents like Liu is nothing short of savage.	中国对待像刘这样持不同政见者的态度可以用野蛮来形容。
Yet Western leaders have offered only a few carefully phrased diplomatic statements criticizing it.	但西方领导人仅仅发表了一些措辞谨慎的批评性的外交言论。
I can only wonder how many Western leaders in recent years have raised Liu’s case with their Chinese counterparts behind closed doors.	我只想知道近年来有多少西方领导人曾关起门来向中国官员提到刘晓波。
Opportunities surely abounded, including at this summer’s G20 meeting, when Liu was on his deathbed.	这样的机会肯定不少，其中包括今年夏天召开的G20峰会，当时刘晓波已经濒临死亡。
But it seems unlikely that Western leaders confronted Chinese President Xi Jinping on the matter.	但西方领导人不太可能因此正面对抗中国国家主席习近平。
After all, when Liu was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2010, and an infuriated China attempted to ostracize Norway, the West did not express outrage or display real solidarity with a NATO ally.	毕竟，当刘在2010年被授予诺贝尔奖以及被激怒的中国试图惩罚挪威时，西方并没有表达愤怒，也没有展现出与北约盟友的真正团结。
China’s treatment of Hong Kong has gone similarly uncontested by Western leaders.	中国对香港的态度同样没有引起西方领导人的反抗。
China seems intent on violating its obligations, established in the “joint declaration” signed with the United Kingdom, to preserve the city’s way of life and the rule of law until 2047.	中国似乎决意违反与英国所签署的“联合声明”所规定的义务，到2047年前保持这座城市的法治体系和生活方式。
Already, it has threatened the independence of the judiciary, the autonomy of universities, and freedom of the press.	中国已经开始威胁香港的司法独立、大学自治和新闻自由。
Yet there has been little pushback from the West, including the UK.	但西方国家，包括英国在内，几乎没有任何反抗的企图。
Why are Western countries so reluctant to criticize China’s behavior more loudly and consistently?	西方国家为什么不愿大肆批评中国的所作所为？
The answer, it seems, is money.	答案似乎是钱在作祟。
Greece, which proudly claims to be the cradle of democracy, has leaders who largely grew up opposing an authoritarian military government.	自诩为民主摇篮的希腊领袖在成长过程中大都有反对独裁军政府的经历。
Yet its cash-strapped government recently blocked the European Union from criticizing China’s human-rights record at the United Nations, because China provides critical investment, particularly from the China Ocean Shipping Company, known as COSCO, which in August 2016 acquired a majority stake in the port of Piraeus.	但希腊现金紧张的政府最近阻止欧盟在联合国对中国的人权状况提出批评，因为中国为他们提供了关键投资，尤其是来自中国远洋运输公司（英文缩写为COSCO）的投资，该公司于2016年8月完成了对希腊比雷埃夫斯港大部分股权的收购。
Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras – a supposedly radical leftist who, paying homage to Che Guevara, named his son Ernesto – has become a Chinese patsy.	希腊总理亚历克西斯·齐普拉斯 — — 据称是一名敬重切·格瓦拉的激进左翼份子，他为自己的儿子取名为埃内斯托 — — 现在已经成为中国的傀儡。
The West’s moral bankruptcy is on display closer to home, too.	西方也越来越接近道义上的破产。
The EU continues to hold back from condemning the thuggery of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who has proudly boasted of his belief in “illiberal democracy” (an oxymoron if ever there was one).	欧盟继续拒绝对谋财害命的匈牙利总理欧尔班进行谴责。 欧尔班曾自豪地吹嘘自己信仰“非自由民主 ” （ 非自由民主的说法本身就充满了矛盾 ） 。
Under Orbán’s leadership, breaches of human-rights conventions in the treatment of refugees have been accompanied by a crackdown on civil society, particularly on organizations that receive money from outside the country.	在欧尔班的领导下，匈牙利不仅违反难民待遇人权公约而且镇压民间社会，尤其是那些资金来自国外的民间组织。
One notable target of repression is Central European University, a bastion of open debate, teaching, and research in Hungary, which is funded by George Soros.	主要的镇压目标是中欧大学，这所大学是乔治·索罗斯出资修建的匈牙利教学、研究和公开辩论的堡垒。
Orbán has even gone so far as to resurrect some of the nastiest anti-Semitic images of 1930s Hungary (an ally of Nazi Germany) to demonize Soros.	欧尔班甚至恢复了20世纪30年代匈牙利某些最恶毒的反犹形象（这些形象曾经是纳粹德国的盟友）以妖魔化索罗斯。
Yet Orbán himself attended the University of Oxford (where I am Chancellor) on a Soros-funded scholarship, and studied there under the great liberal thinker Isaiah Berlin.	但欧尔班本人曾在索罗斯奖学金的资助下在牛津大学就读（我现在担任牛津大学的校长 ） ， 并曾经跟随伟大的自由思想家以赛亚·柏林学习。
Even as Orbán’s Hungary rejects the obligations of EU membership, it receives more than €5.5 billion ($6.4 billion) from the EU each year, while contributing less than €1 billion to the common budget.	即便欧尔班的匈牙利拒绝履行欧盟成员国义务，该国仍从欧洲每年收到超过55亿欧元（合64亿美元）的巨资，而仅为共同预算贡献不到10亿欧元。
Why should European citizens pay so much to a government that thumbs its nose at them and compares the EU to the Soviet Union?	欧洲民众为什么要为一个无视他们并将欧盟比作苏联的政府提供那么多资金？
At the very least, the EU should apply the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty that allow it to suspend some of the rights of a country that is breaking its rules and showing contempt for its standards and values.	至少，欧盟应当适用《里斯本条约》的相关条款，该条约允许欧盟暂时收回破坏其规则并藐视其标准和价值观的某些国家的权利。
The behavior of Poland’s Law and Justice (PiS) government – which shows scant concern for either law or justice – raises similar issues.	波兰法律与正义党政府的行为 — — 虽然该党对法律和正义几乎鲜有关注 — — 提出了类似的问题。
The government is working to overhaul the constitution, in order to thwart democratic checks and balances.	该政府正在竭尽全力修宪，目的是取消民主制衡。
It plainly wants judges to do what politicians tell them, and it does not want the media to be able to say much about it.	政府显然希望法官执行政客的命令，而且不希望媒体能够自由评论。
I daresay that China’s rulers would have no difficulty in understanding the PiS’s approach.	我敢说中国的执政者能够与波兰法律与正义党产生共鸣。
Turkey, of course, is not a member of the EU, nor will it ever become one if it continues along the road of dictatorial repression taken by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, no small fan of Russia’s Vladimir Putin.	土耳其当然不是欧盟成员国，而且如果它沿埃尔多安独裁镇压的道路继续走下去也永远不可能加入欧盟。 雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安总统非常崇拜俄国的弗拉基米尔·普京。
But, judging by the EU’s growing tolerance of illiberalism, some EU leaders may well be prepared to contemplate a closer relationship with Erdoğan’s Turkey.	但根据欧盟对非自由主义越来越宽容的态度判断，某些欧盟领导人可能准备考虑与埃尔多安的土耳其建立更密切的关系。
Such foreign-policy decadence threatens to undermine the EU’s claim to be a community of values, not just a glorified customs union.	欧盟不仅是关税同盟而且是价值共同体，而外交政策上的这种堕落有可能破坏欧盟的共同价值观。
As we know from the 1920s and 1930s, as decadence breeds more decadence, the world becomes an increasingly dangerous and unstable place.	正如20世纪20年代和20世纪30年代的历史所告诉我们的那样，随着颓废滋生更多颓废，世界将变得越来越危险和不稳定。
It is time for Europe – to be joined by the United States after President Donald Trump leaves office – to find our moral compass once again.	欧盟是时候联合唐纳德·特朗普总统离任后的美国 — — 再次找到我们的道德定位。
	
How Western Economies Can Avoid the Japan Trap	西方经济如何能够避免日本陷阱
NEW YORK – Not too long ago, the conventional wisdom held that “Japanification” could never happen in Western economies.	纽约—不久前，传统智慧还认为西方经济永远不会发生“日本化 ” 。
Leading US economists argued that if the combined threat of weak growth, disinflation, and perpetually low interest rates ever materialized, policymakers would have the tools to deal with it.	美国著名经济学家们认为，如果增长萎靡、通胀疲软和长期低利率的综合威胁真的成为现实，决策者也有应对工具。
They had no problem lecturing the Japanese about the need for bold measures to pull their country out of a decades-old rut.	他们毫无问题地指导日本人采取果断措施让国家走出长达几十年的“巨坑 ” 。
Japanification was regarded as the avoidable consequence of poor policymaking, not as an inevitability.	日本化被认为是糟糕的决策的结果，它是可以避免的。
And yet the specter of Japanification now looms over the West.	但日本化的幽灵如今飘荡在西方上空。
After the 2008 financial crisis, the recoveries in both Europe and the United States were more sluggish and less inclusive than the majority of policymakers, politicians, and economists expected.	2008年金融危机后，欧洲和美国的复苏都比大部分决策者、政客和经济学家所预期的更缓慢，更不包容。
And, more recently, hopes for achieving “escape velocity” out of the “new normal” of low growth and persistent disinflationary pressure have been dashed in Europe and Japan, and some worry that they may be receding in the US.	最近，实现摆脱低增长和持续反通胀压力的“新常态”的“逃逸速度”的希望在欧洲和日本日益渺茫，一些人担心美国也在日益疲软。
Europe, in particular, is back in the grips of a worrisome regionwide slowdown.	特别是欧洲，令人担忧的地区性减速卷土重来。
Growth projections have been consistently revised downward, and the European Central Bank has acknowledged that its earlier optimism about achieving on-target inflation was misplaced.	增长预测不断向下调整，欧洲央行承认早前实现通胀目标的乐观态度有误。
With yields on government bonds having fallen, the global trade in securities at negative interest rates has reached around $10 trillion.	政府债券收益率下降，全球负利率政权交易量已达10万亿美元。
Meanwhile, Japan is approaching its fourth consecutive decade of consistently low nominal growth, inflation, and interest rates.	与此同时，日本正在接近连续第四个持续低名义增长、通胀和利率的十年。
And in the US, a growing number of economists are worried about a coming slowdown, with some urging the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, and others calling for it to adopt a higher inflation target in order to combat the risk of excessive disinflation.	而在美国，越来越多的经济学家担心减速将至，一些人敦促美联储削减利率，也有人要求调高通胀目标，以遏制过度反通胀的风险。
Were all those Western economists who dismissed the threat of Japanification in the past being too glib?	是否所有过去否认过日本化威胁的西方经济学家都过于油嘴滑舌了？
Yes and no.	是，也不是。
Today’s Japanification fears stem from legitimate worries about structural disinflationary forces that could cause lower, less inclusive growth, both directly and indirectly.	今天的日本化恐慌来自对结构性反通胀力量的合理担忧，这些力量可能会直接和间接地导致更低迷、更不包容的增长。
These forces include societal aging, rising inequality (in terms of income, wealth, and opportunity), social and economic insecurity among broad segments of the population, and a loss of trust in institutions and expert opinion.	这些力量包括社会老龄化、不平等性加剧（以收入、财富和机会衡量 ） 、 多个人口细分群体的社会和经济不安全，以及对机构和专家观点失去信任。
Along with the zombification of firms after the last asset bubble, these structural factors have led to lower demand, as well as increased risk aversion and self-insurance, rather than growth-promoting risk-pooling, at the margin.	与上一场资产泡沫后的企业僵尸化一同出现的是，这些结构性因素导致了边际需求低迷以及风险厌恶和自我保险，而没有带来有利于增长的风险集中。
Innovation, particularly in artificial intelligence, big data, and mobility, is another factor.	创新，特别是人工智能、大数据和移动技术的创新，是另一个因素。
Though the economic impact of these technologies is ambiguous, there is no doubt that they are reducing entry barriers across a growing number of economic activities and putting downward pressure on prices (the “Amazon effect”), at least in the short term.	尽管这些技术的经济影响模棱两可，但毫无疑问它们降低了越来越多种类的经济活动之间的壁垒，也带来了价格下降压力 （ “ 亚马逊效应 ” ， 至少在短期是如此。
Nonetheless, their long-term effects on growth and productivity remain to be seen.	）但是，它们对增长和生产率的长期效应仍有待观察。
Growth is also being undercut in less direct ways.	增长还受到不那么直接的因素的影响。
For example, persistently low – and in some cases negative – interest rates tend to eat away at the institutional integrity and operational effectiveness of the financial system, thereby reducing bank lending and limiting the range of long-term products that insurance/retirement firms can offer to households.	比如，持续低迷 — — 有时甚至为负 — — 的利率总会破坏机构完整性和金融体系的经营效率，从而减少银行贷款，限制保险/退休企业能够向家庭提供的长期产品的范围。
Another indirect effect stems from expectations about the future.	另一个间接影响来自对未来的预期。
The longer growth and inflation remain low, the more tempted households and companies will be to postpone consumption and investment decisions, thus prolonging low growth and inflation.	增长和利率低迷的时间越长，家庭和公司越有可能推迟消费和投资决定，从而延长低增长和通胀。
The Western economists who initially underestimated the threat of Japanification did so because they had downplayed or simply ignored these direct and indirect factors.	一开始低估日本化的威胁的西方经济学家之所以如此，是因为他们低估或根本没有看到这些直接和间接因素。
In retrospect, they should not be surprised to find that the societies with the fastest-aging populations and less inward migration are the ones now struggling with Japanification.	事后看来，他们看到迅速老龄化和移民到来较少的社会如今深陷日本化泥淖不会感到惊奇。
Still, those economists were not wrong to argue that policies can play a decisive role in macroeconomic outcomes – especially when structural forces are being amplified by excessive cyclical tightening, as was the case in Japan in 1989.	尽管如此，那些经济学家认为政策能够对宏观经济结果起决定性作用是不错的 — — 特别是在结构性力量被过度的周期性紧缩放大的时候，比如1989年的日本。
The problem is that they have tended to focus too narrowly on monetary policy, while overestimating its effectiveness.	问题在于，他们往往过于狭隘地关注货币政策，而高估了它的效果。
Countries at risk of Japanification need a much broader mix of policies to address both the demand side and the supply side of the economy.	有可能发生日本化的国家需要更广泛的政策组合，以解决经济需求侧和供给侧的问题。
Monetary policy, after all, is less effective near the “zero bound” and in scenarios where other “liquidity trap” factors are in play.	毕竟，货币政策在“零区间”附近和其他“流动性陷阱”起作用的情形效果会打折扣。
Large-scale balance sheet operations like quantitative easing (QE) can buy time by seeking to inject more liquidity directly into the system.	大规模资产负债表操作，比如量化宽松（QE ） ， 通过向系统直接注入流动性来争取时间。
But they don’t address the underlying issues, and they come with their own set of costs, forms of collateral damage, and unintended consequences.	但它们并不解决根本性问题，并且本身也会造成成本，各种附带伤害，以及意料外后果。
The strongest protection against Japanification, then, is a combination of demand- and supply-side measures at the national, regional (in the case of Europe), and global levels.	因此，针对日本化的最强保护是在国家、地区（如欧洲）和全球层面，需求侧和供给侧措施双管齐下。
In countries with adequate fiscal space, this could mean looser government budgets and more productivity-enhancing investments (such as in infrastructure, education, and training).	在财政空间充裕的国家，这意味着放松政府预算和增加提高生产率的投资（如基础设施、教育和培训 ） 。
And in any country facing skills shortages, increased legal migration and better policies to facilitate labor mobility can help close the gap.	而凡是面临技能短缺的国家，增加合法移民和更好地便利劳动力流动的政策有助于弥补缺口。
Moreover, these policies would need to be accompanied by more effective protections for the most vulnerable segments of the population, particularly when it comes to health, training, and labor retooling.	此外，这些政策必须辅之以更有效地保护人口中最脆弱的群体，特别是在健康、培训和劳动重组方面。
None of this will materialize without better political leadership and more enlightened global policy interactions.	除非有更好的政治领导和更开明的全球政策互动，否则所有这些政策都无法实现。
Japanification offers three lessons that Western policymakers and politicians have yet to internalize sufficiently.	日本化带来了三个教训，西方决策者和政客还没有充分消化。
First, structural pressures make prompt action to reverse low growth, disinflation, and zero-to-low interest rates all the more critical.	首先，结构性压力使得扭转低增长、反通胀和零或低利率动作变得非常关键。
Second, unconventional monetary measures may be necessary, but they certainly are not sufficient.	其次，非常规货币措施可能必要条件，但绝非充分条件。
And, third, when crafting the required comprehensive policy response, we must recognize that the hurdles are a lot less technical, and a lot more political.	第三，在制定必要的全面政策响应时，我们必须承认，障碍的技术因素很小，而政治因素很大。
	
What About the World?	把世界晾在一边了吗？
As America’s primaries move beyond Iowa and New Hampshire, it is simply impossible to predict who will be the Democratic and Republican nominees, much less who will become the 44th president of the United States.	尽管美国已经完成了在艾奥瓦州和新罕布尔什州的预选，但是现在还很难预测谁将被民主党和共和党提名为候选人，更别说谁将成为美国的第44任总统了。
But it is not too soon to address the question of what effect US foreign policy is having on the campaign and what it reveals about how Americans see the world.	但是现在来讨论美国的外交政策将对竞选活动产生怎样的影响以及它显示了美国人是如何看待世界的问题却并不嫌早。
To the surprise of many seasoned observers, foreign policy is having only a modest impact on voters.	令许多老资格的观察家感到惊讶的是，外交政策只对选民产生了很小的影响。
This is unexpected, because only six months ago the war in Iraq dominated the political landscape.	这是大家所没有预料到的，因为仅仅是在六个月前关于在伊拉克的战争的争论还一直是政治上的热点。
Although Iraq still matters a lot to Americans, its importance for determining how they vote has receded, partly because US casualties there are markedly down as the security situation appears to be gradually improving.	尽管伊拉克问题对于美国人来说依然还是一个重要问题，它在决定他们把票投给谁的问题上的重要性却大大减弱了，这部分是因为美国在那儿的伤亡情况随着安全状况的逐步好转已经大大减少了。
As a result, there is considerably less public pressure to do something dramatically different.	其结果是，公众要求做出一些引人注目的不同的举动的压力大大减弱了。
Foreign policy has also become less salient than it was only months ago as the chance of war between the US and Iran has diminished, following the recently published National Intelligence Estimate on Iran’s nuclear program.	外交政策问题没有几个月以前那么突出的另一个原因是随着国家情报评估机构最近有关伊朗核计划报告的出台，美国和伊朗爆发战争的可能性已经减少了。
The judgment by America’s intelligence community that Iran has suspended its nuclear weapon development program – and, more importantly, that its large-scale uranium enrichment capacity is likely years away – postpones the day when a US president may have to decide between living with or attacking a nuclear Iran.	根据美国情报部门的判断，伊朗已经搁置了它的核武器开发计划，并且，更重要的是，它大规模浓缩铀的能力似乎还要花很多年才能实现，这也使得某位美国总统必须对与一个拥有核武器的伊朗相处还是发起攻击做出决定的日期被大大延后了。
A third reason for the modest impact of international issues on voters’ choice of the next president is another surprising development: more agreement between and among the leading candidates than meets the eye.	国际问题对于选民选择下一任总统的决定影响不太大的第三个原因是事态另一个惊人的发展：就是居于领先的候选人在许多问题上的观点有很大的相似之处。
There is something of a consensus, for example, emerging around the notion that the US should remain in Iraq for some time to come, albeit with a reduced level of military forces.	比如说，大家对美军应该在伊拉克停留相当长一段时间有某种共识，尽管他们对于应该削减多少兵力意见也许不尽一致。
There is also widespread acknowledgement that the US must do more both at home and diplomatically to address global climate change; that the US must work with its European allies to prevent Afghanistan from slipping back into anarchy; and that the US must take the strongest possible stand against terrorism and those who would support it in any way. No major candidate is advocating anything remotely resembling isolationism.	另外大家对于美国为应对全球气候变化问题而应该在国内和国外做出更大的努力、美国必须与它的欧洲盟友一道防止阿富汗滑向无政府状态以及美国采取最强硬的手段对抗恐怖主义以及以任何方式支持恐怖主义的人也有广泛的共识。 另外也没有哪个主要的候选人提出任何哪怕是与孤立主义沾一点边的主张。
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the deterioration of America’s economy is now overshadowing foreign policy.	最后，但也许是最重要的，人们对美国经济低迷的担忧现在盖过了对外交政策的关心。
The greatest crisis facing many Americans is their increasing inability to meet their monthly mortgage payments.	许多美国人现在所面临的最大危机是他们越来越无力支付每月的房屋按揭。
Recession, job loss, and expensive oil, not war, is what Americans fear most for 2008.	经济衰退、失业以及越来越昂贵的油价而不是战争是美国人在2008年最担心的问题。
This is not to suggest that foreign policy is absent from the campaign.	这并不是说竞选活动不会涉及到外交政策问题。
Along with the economy, a dominant issue on the political agenda – and one that has affected Republican politics in particular – is immigration.	除开经济问题，在政治议程上的一个主要问题，也是对共和党的政治家影响最大的问题是移民问题。
There is growing opposition to illegal entry, but no consensus about what to do about those who have been in the country illegally for years or those who want to come to the US in the future.	公众对于非法入境问题的抗议声越来越大，但是对怎样处理那些已经在国内非法居住了数年或者未来想要到美国来的那些人并没有达成一致的意见。
It is also possible to see in the politics of both parties mounting concern about globalization.	我们还有可能看到两党的政治家都越来越关注全球化问题。
With tougher economic times inevitably come tougher positions toward foreign competition and outsourcing.	随着经济形势越来越严峻，公众对于外国竞争和外包问题的态度也会变得越来越强硬。
There may also be latent concern about foreign policy in the attention being given to the quantity and quality of candidates’ relevant experience.	在大家关注候选人相关经验的数量和质量时，也可能会潜在涉及到外交政策问题。
A desire for “change” is a common refrain of the American debate, but it is far from the only one.	对“变革”的渴望已经成为美国辩论中最常引用的一个词语，但是这远远不是人们唯一关心的问题。
Renewed interest in foreign policy and the rest of the world could surface if there were a dramatic overseas development.	如果外部形势出现某些戏剧性的发展，大家可能会重新燃起对外交政策和外部世界的兴趣。
We saw this a few weeks ago, when former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was assassinated.	几周前当巴基斯坦前总理贝·布托遇刺身亡时我们就看到了这样的情况。
Democratic and Republican candidates alike were called upon to explain what they would be prepared to do if there were an opportunity to capture Osama Bin Laden or a need to secure Pakistan’s nuclear weapons.	民主党和共和党的候选人都被要求解释如果他们遇到有机会抓住本·拉登或者需要保护巴基斯坦的核武器时他们准备如何应对。
Likewise, Iraq could return to center stage if the positive momentum of recent months were suddenly reversed, perhaps following a new outbreak of violence between the country’s Sunnis and Shia.	同样地，如果近几个月伊拉克好转的形势发生突然的倒转，比如这个国家的逊尼派和什叶派爆发新一轮的暴力冲突，那么伊拉克问题就会重新回到人们视野的中心。
The US and Iran could go to war not over nuclear issues but because of reckless behavior by the Revolutionary Guards (as occurred recently in the Strait of Hormuz), with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad possibly seeking to provoke a crisis in order to distract domestic attention from his economic failures.	美国和伊朗也许会走向战争，不是因为核问题，而是因为国民卫队的鲁莽行为（就像最近在霍尔姆兹湾发生的事件 ） ， 以及伊朗总统内贾德可能会寻求挑起危机以分散国内对于他在经济问题上的失败的注意力。
Order in Pakistan could break down irretrievably.	巴基斯坦国内的秩序可能会遭到无法挽回的破坏。
A terrorist attack could remind Americans of their fundamental vulnerability.	一次恐怖袭击可能会提醒美国人他们在本质上的脆弱性。
The possibilities are endless.	这里存在着种种的可能性。
America’s next president will face a host of pressing and difficult foreign policy challenges – and how he or she responds will affect not only the US, but the entire world.	美国的下一任总统将会面临一系列紧迫并且艰难的外交政策上的挑战，而他或她对此将如何回应将不仅会影响美国，而且会影响整个世界。
In the meantime, though, foreign policy will have only an indirect influence on Americans’ choice.	不过，与此同时外交政策对于美国人的选择只会产生某些间接的影响。
	
What Are Homebuyers Thinking?	购房者在想什么？
Many places around the world have been in a housing boom since the late 1990’s.	从20世纪90年代末开始，世界很多地方的住宅市场都一派繁荣。
As I argued last year, in the second edition of my book Irrational Exuberance , the boom is rooted in speculative investment by ordinary homebuyers, fueled substantially by the worldwide perception that capitalism has triumphed, and that all people must look out for themselves by acquiring property.	正如去年我在拙作《非理性繁荣》第二版中所提到的那样，这种繁荣的根源在于普通购房者的投机性买入，而认为资本主义已经在全球范围内获胜，所有人都必须购进财产的普遍看法在很大程度上起了推波助澜的作用。
Convinced that private ownership has become essential to smart living, buyers bid up home prices.	购房者坚信私有制已经成为明智生活不可或缺的组成部分，他们相互竞价，房价也跟着水涨船高。
Moreover, the fear that one must get in on the boom before it is too late often drives people to bid up home prices faster now.	不仅如此，在无论如何要赶上这波繁荣浪潮，否则将追悔莫及的恐惧驱使下，人们更加不遗余力的抬高房价。
This certainly seems to be the market psychology in China and India, where rapidly rising incomes and newly successful people are widely expected to put pressure on markets for land, real estate, and construction materials.	中国和印度无疑受到这种市场心理的左右，人们普遍认为那里快速增长的收入和飞黄腾达的新贵给土地、房地产和建筑材料市场带来了很大压力。
Real estate booms have been going on in these countries’ major cities for years.	房地产繁荣已经在这些国家的主要城市上演了数年之久。
In China, despite some signs of weakness – the Shanghai market is down, for example – price growth is still robust in much of the country.	尽管中国的房地产市场已经出现了转弱的迹象¾比如上海的房价就在下跌¾但绝大多数城市的房价上涨仍然风头正劲。
But the boom generated by such beliefs cannot go on forever, because prices can’t go up forever, and there are already signs of a hard landing.	但这种心理所造就的繁荣不可能永远继续下去，因为价格不可能永远上涨，而且已经出现了硬着陆的迹象。
In the United States, newspapers and magazines are trumpeting reports in the last few months that the decade-long boom in home prices may be at an end, and that the bubble may be bursting.	过去几个月来，美国的报纸和杂志一直在鼓吹长达10年之久的房价上涨也许即将结束，泡沫的破灭也许就在眼前。
The psychology has suddenly changed, creating widespread fear of sharp drops in US home prices.	心理预期在眨眼之间发生了改变，人们普遍对美国房价骤跌充满了恐惧。
The new futures market for single-family homes at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (which I helped establish last May with our firm MacroMarkets LLC) is predicting that by next August prices will fall between 6% and 8% in all ten US cities traded.	据芝加哥商品交易所新设立的独立住宅期货市场（去年5月我所在的宏观证券研究有限公司曾经对该市场的筹建起到过辅助作用）预测：截至明年8月，在全部10座参与交易的美国城市中，房价的跌幅将达到6%到8 % 。
If home prices crash in the US, the bastion of capitalism, could it destroy confidence and end the boom in other countries?	如果作为资本主义堡垒的美国房价骤跌，人们的信心是否会受到影响，从而给其他国家的房地产繁荣划上句号？
If so, could a worldwide recession follow?	如果这种情况真的出现，世界性的经济衰退是否不可避免？
This scenario is a distinct possibility, although there are reasons to be skeptical.	尽管人们有理由抱着怀疑的态度，但出现上述情况也绝非天方夜谈。
Most importantly, the ultimate sources of the housing boom – the beliefs about capitalism and future economic growth – seem solidly entrenched.	最重要的是，住宅繁荣的终极源泉¾也就是人们对资本主义和未来经济发展所抱有的信心¾似乎是坚不可摧的。
The downward price trend in the US market, for example, does not seem to reflect underlying changes in long-run economic confidence.	例如，美国市场的价格回落似乎并不是长期经济信心发生变化的标志。
The survey that Karl Case and I conducted in May and June of this year, under the auspices of the Yale School of Management, shows sharp declines in short-term expectations for home prices in the US, but relatively little change in long-term expectations.	今年五、六月份卡尔·凯斯（Karl Case）和我在耶鲁管理学院的赞助下共同进行的民意调查表明：人们预期住宅价格会在短期内大幅下跌，但对长期房价的预测却变化不大。
Most people still believe that housing is a great long-term investment.	绝大多数人依然相信住宅是长期投资的最佳方式。
Maybe real estate prices are unlikely to fall to pre-boom levels because the fundamental change in perceptions concerning capitalism’s triumph will be longstanding.	也许房价不太可能跌落到暴涨之前的水平，因为从根本上改变人们对资本主义优越性的认识是一个长期的过程。
Changes in people’s fundamental ways of thinking are not easily reversed.	人们最基本的思维方式很难改变。
Nor, therefore, is their interest in housing as a major speculative investment asset likely to change.	因此，他们对住宅作为主要投机资产的兴趣似乎也将延续下去。
The transformation in investors’ beliefs is striking.	投资人观念的变化令人震惊。
Before the real estate boom of the late 1970’s, hardly anyone was worried about rising home prices.	20世纪70年代末房地产价格上涨之前，很少有人对房价的上涨表示忧虑。
A search of old newspapers finds surprisingly few articles about the outlook for home prices.	翻遍过去的报纸也找不到几篇有关未来房价的评论。
Those that did appear generally seem to be based on the assumption that minor fluctuations in construction costs, not massive market swings, drove the modest home price movements that they noted.	有限的几篇评论一般也认为建筑成本的小幅波动、而非大规模的市场振荡是造成小幅房价涨落的驱动力量。
Indeed, hardly anything interesting about home prices was ever reported at all, aside from an occasional comment in an article about something else.	实际上，除去以其他内容为主题的某篇文章中偶尔可见些零星的评论，此外几乎看不到有关房价的任何有趣报道。
For example, an article in The Times of London in 1970 argued that rising home prices reflected the switch to a new British Standard Time (imposed as a three-year experiment in 1968 to facilitate commerce with Western Europe by putting Britain in the same time zone).	例如，1970年《泰晤士报》上的一篇文章指出：房价上涨是实行新英国标准时间的反映（新标准时间从1968年开始，试行3年，目的是使英国处在与西欧各国相同的时区，从而推动相互之间的贸易 ） 。
The article claimed that the change raised costs by forcing British construction workers to perform more of their jobs in relative darkness.	那篇文章声称这项改变提高了建筑成本，因为英国建筑工人不得不在相对较暗的天色中完成大部分工作。
Speculative investment behavior was hardly an issue in those rare instances in which home prices were discussed.	在讨论房价的少数几篇文章中，投机获利行为几乎没能引起任何关注。
To understand the nature of the subsequent shift, consider that it is hard to find anyone today who worries that automobile prices will soar because rising demand in China and India for steel and other materials will push automobile prices out of reach in the future.	要想对接下来的变化性质有所了解，只要类比一下今天很少有人会担心车价飞涨，以及中国和印度对钢铁和其他材料日益增长的需求会使未来车价变得高不可攀的事例就够了。
Though a small group of collectors invests speculatively in antique or specialty cars, the idea of speculating in automobiles just is not in the public consciousness.	尽管一小群收藏爱好者对古董或特制汽车情有独钟，但投机汽车的想法根本没有被公众所广泛接受。
That is how it was with housing until the late 1970’s.	直到20世纪70年代末，住房的情况也大同小异。
Now that we think differently about real estate, we will never be the same again.	现在我们对房产的看法已经发生了改变，再也回不到原来的样子了。
But, of course, housing prices can only rise so fast.	但勿庸置疑，房价的上涨实在是太快了。
High and rapidly rising home prices tend to stimulate new housing supply, which in turn tends to undermine prices.	快速上涨的高昂房价将刺激新的住宅供应，而新增住宅供应又反过来威胁到价格。
Over a period of years, as people see how much new supply there is, they may begin to revise their view that homes are such a terrific investment, causing a gradual, but eventually significant, drop in home prices.	在若干年内，随着人们对新房供应量的认识，房产是一种完美投资的看法就有可能发生改变，从而导致缓慢、但最终却是大幅度的房价回落。
Indeed, while changes in fundamental perceptions may not occur easily or fast, they should never be ruled out.	实际上，尽管基本观念的转变艰难而又缓慢，但这样的变化却永远也无法彻底排除。
Urban land prices in major Japanese cities have steadily dropped over much of the period since 1991, as the enormous faith in the miraculous powers of Japanese capitalism gradually faded.	随着对日本资本主义神奇力量信心的逐渐减退，1991年以后日本主要城市的地价一直处在稳步的回落当中。
The same kind of erosion in home prices could occur in many cities around the world.	房价的下降同样也可能发生在世界许多城市。
All that is required is that growth in housing supply eventually outstrips investors’ faith in capitalism to sustain faster growth in demand.	只需住宅供应的增长最终超过投资者对资本主义的信心，这样需求的更快增长则必将难以为继。
	
The Ghosts of North Korea	朝鲜的鬼魂
TOKYO – For most people, the arrival of a new year prompts a moment of reflection on what has been working and what needs to change.	东京 — — 对多数人来说，新一年的到来促使他们反思哪些应该保持、哪些需要改变。
Not for the people of North Korea.	但朝鲜人除外。
In that benighted country, “New Year’s resolutions” are not really an option for ordinary citizens.	在这个愚昧的国家 ， “ 新年决策”的权利不属于普通民众。
What happens to them depends entirely on their supreme leader, Kim Jong-un, and typically involves grim paranoia and deprivation.	他们的未来完全取决于最高领导人金正恩，并且往往伴随着冷酷与偏执的剥夺。
North Koreans endure plenty about which outsiders can only speculate.	朝鲜人忍受的苦难很多都不为外人所知。
Consider the mysterious “ghost ships” that are carried to the Sea of Japan each autumn by southwesterly winds.	比如每年秋天被西南季风吹到日本海的神秘的“鬼船 ” 。
The boats are crude, small (about ten meters in length), and equipped with little more than basic fishing gear.	这些船粗糙、狭小（长约10米 ） ， 除了最基本的渔具以外几乎没有任何其他设施。
Some are empty; others carry the dead bodies of unidentified men.	其中有些空无一人，有些则携带着身份不明的男性尸体。
Last month alone, 13 boats and 26 bodies (most already largely decomposed) were found.	仅上月一个月就发现了13艘这样的小船和26具尸体（其中多数都已大体腐烂 ） 。
In 2014, more than 60 such boats turned up.	2014年一年，就发现了超过60艘这样的小船。
Some of the boats and their contents bore markings in Korean Hangul script.	有些船及船上物品印有韩语标识。
One carried a handwritten sign stating that it belonged to unit 325 of the North Korean army.	其中一条带有朝军325部队的手写标志。
Another contained a tattered cloth that appeared to have once been part of a North Korean flag.	另一条船上有一块破布，似乎曾经是一面朝鲜国旗。
Add to that the boats’ dilapidated condition and lack of equipment, and the conclusion that they were North Korean seems fairly certain.	再加上破旧且缺乏设备，这些船属于朝鲜似乎没有多少怀疑。
What is more difficult to discern is what the ships were for, and why they have been making their way, in such large numbers, to Japan’s shores and territorial waters.	这些船是做什么的、它们为什么要成群结队前往日本领海及海岸似乎更难判断。
After all, they seem like fishing boats, not military vessels, though North Korean soldiers are frequently also fishermen.	毕竟，尽管朝鲜士兵往往同时是渔民，这些船似乎并非军舰而仅仅是渔船。
It has been widely speculated that the boats were filled with would-be defectors, not least because they resemble boats on which living defectors arrived in Japan.	人们普遍猜测这些船载有可能的叛逃者，这不仅因为它们像极了活的叛逃者逃往日本所坐的小船。
Another explanation is that the boats are filled simply with fishermen who, under pressure from the government to boost their yields, ventured out too far into the open sea.	另一种解释是船上只是普通的渔民，在政府提高产量的压力下冒险驶入远海。
Sadly, that explanation is all too plausible.	可悲的是，这种解释完全合情合理。
North Korea’s government goes to great lengths to conceal the country’s abysmal food shortages, even going so far as to unveil to the foreign media an advanced indoor vegetable-farming facility near Pyongyang.	朝鲜政府竭力掩盖国内粮食极度短缺的事实，甚至不惜向外媒公开平壤附近一座先进的室内蔬菜种植设施。
But the fact is that there have been no sustained improvements to food production since the mass starvation of the 1990s and early 2000s, despite slightly greater tolerance of private production by farmers.	但实际情况是尽管对农民私人种植的容忍度略有提高，但20世纪90年代和21世纪初大规模饥荒爆发后粮食生产并未得到持续改善。
Indeed, although Kim identified “food for the people” as one of his regime’s top three priorities for 2015, little investment in this effort was actually made.	事实上，尽管金正恩将“保障人民粮食供应”列为2015年政府三件大事之一，但在这方面实际投资却并不多见。
Not even the resumption of fertilizer supplies by a private South Korean organization was enough to make a real difference.	就连韩国一家私营机构恢复供应化肥都不足以真正改变局面。
With fallow soil and a poor climate inhibiting agriculture, North Korea’s government has indeed apparently been encouraging a growing number of fishing boats to go farther out in search of bigger catches.	由于土地撂荒和恶劣气候限制农业发展，朝鲜政府其实一直在鼓励更多渔船为提高产量而驶向远海。
Given the boats’ poor quality, it is no surprise that many do not make it home.	鉴于这些船只质量低劣，其中很多有去无回也并不意外。
The ghost ships are not the only source of odd questions and speculation about North Korea.	鬼船并非引发朝鲜奇特问题和猜测的唯一来源。
Just this month, the all-girl Moranbong Band – reportedly organized and sponsored by Kim himself – canceled its first performance in China, intended for Chinese Communist Party officials.	就在这个月，全部由女孩组成的牡丹峰乐团 — — 据称由金本人亲自出资筹建 — — 取消了面向中国共产党官员的对华首演。
Soon after arriving by train in Beijing, the band’s members were quickly bundled onto a plane back to Pyongyang.	乘火车抵达北京后不久，乐队成员很快又被塞进了返回平壤的飞机。
Some have speculated that a song praising North Korea’s nuclear program was too much for China’s leadership to stomach, especially so soon after Kim declared (probably falsely) that his regime had detonated a hydrogen bomb.	有人猜测一首赞美朝鲜核计划的颂歌令中国领导人难以忍受，尤其是金正恩刚刚宣布（可能是假消息）其政府引爆了一颗氢弹。
Others think that Kim was angered by the news that Chinese President Xi Jinping and other top Chinese leaders would not be attending the concert.	也有人认为中国国家主席习近平等高层领导人不出席音乐会的消息激怒了金正恩。
In any case, the relationship with China, on which North Korea has long depended, seems to be coming under increasing strain.	无论如何，朝鲜长期依赖的对华关系紧张程度似乎在不断升高。
As for Japan’s relationship with North Korea, the outlook remains far from rosy.	至于日本和朝鲜的关系，其前景离乐观也相去甚远。
Discussions of North Korea’s abduction of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s – a major impediment to official relations – have stalled.	20世纪七八十年代有关朝鲜绑架日本公民的谈判 — — 一直是正式关系的主要障碍 — — 已经停滞不前。
North Korea has stubbornly maintained its official line that only 13 Japanese were kidnapped; eight died and five were returned to Japan before ever making it to Pyongyang.	朝鲜一直固执地坚持只有13名日本人被绑架的官方说法；其中有八人死亡，五人在抵达平壤前就已经归还给日本。
Japan insists – with good reason – that there were more kidnappings.	但日本坚持认为 — — 而且理由非常充分 — — 有更多的绑架事件。
The five abductees who were repatriated in 2002 included Hitomi Soga, who was not included among the 13 acknowledged kidnappings.	2002年遣返的5名被绑架者中包括曾我瞳，此人并未包含在13名已知被绑架者之内。
This creates the impression that North Korea may still be holding some kidnap victims to use as bargaining chips in discussions on economic cooperation.	日本据此认为朝鲜可能仍然扣押着某些被绑架者，并打算以此为筹码进行经济合作谈判。
Japan continues to demand a new comprehensive investigation into the matter, though North Korea has not been particularly cooperative so far.	日本一直要求就此事展开新的全面调查，但朝鲜迄今为止并未表现出合作的姿态。
During bilateral talks in Stockholm in 2014, the Kim regime agreed to pursue a new investigation, in exchange for Japan’s agreement to lift some sanctions once the inquiry began.	2014年斯德哥尔摩双边谈判期间，金正恩政府同意开始新一轮调查，条件是调查开始后日本同意解除部分制裁。
In July, however, the North reportedly notified the Japanese government of its intention to postpone submitting the results of the reinvestigation.	但7月，朝鲜据称知会日本政府打算延期提交其调查结果。
If the report is eventually submitted and includes the names of one or two abductees available to be sent back to Japan, how should Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government respond?	如果最终提交的报告包括一两名可以送回日本的被绑架者，日本首相安倍晋三的政府应当如何应对？
This kind of manipulation may not merit a visit to North Korea by Abe or the lifting of sanctions.	这样的操纵可能并不值得安倍访问朝鲜或者取消制裁。
So ends another bizarre year (which makes it similar to previous years) in the history of North Korea.	又是朝鲜历史上（与之前非常相似的）奇怪的一年。
The only factor suggesting that 2016 could be different lies in the North’s estrangement from China.	2016年唯一不同的因素也许就是朝鲜与中国的疏远。
Perhaps Japan could take advantage of the strains in that relationship to make some headway in other talks, say, on the nuclear issue.	或许日本可以利用中朝关系紧张在核问题等其他谈判中取得某些进展。
The main question, however, is whether Kim is able and willing to act in his country’s real interests, and not those of his fantasies.	但主要问题是金正恩是否能够并愿意按照国家真正的利益行事，而不是一味满足自己的幻想。
	
Carpet Bombing History in America	美国地毯式轰炸史
NEW YORK – Ted Cruz, one of the Republican candidates for the US presidency, recently said that his solution to the turmoil in the Middle East would be to “carpet bomb” the Islamic State (ISIS) and see if “sand can glow in the dark.”	纽约—美国共和党总统候选人之一泰德·克鲁兹（Ted Cruz）最近说，他有办法解决中东乱局，那就是“地毯式轰炸”伊斯兰国，看看“沙子是否能在黑暗中发光 ” 。
Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner, promised to “bomb the shit out of ISIS.”	共和党竞选阵营领先者唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）承诺“把伊斯兰国炸出屎来 ” 。
A third candidate, Chris Christie, has threatened war with Russia.	另一位候选人克里斯·克里斯蒂（Chris Christie）威胁与俄罗斯开战。
With such rhetoric from their candidates, it is no wonder that, according to a recent poll, some 30% of Republican voters (and 41% of Trump supporters) favored bombing Agrabah, the central (and fictional) location of the Disney film Aladdin.	总统候选人说出这样的话来，无怪乎最新民调表明30%左右的共和党选民（以及41%的特朗普支持者）支持轰炸阿格拉巴（Agrabah，迪士尼电影《阿拉丁》中虚构的中央地区 ） 。
The place sounded Arabic, and that was enough.	这个地方听着像阿拉伯，这就足够了。
One way to read such bellicose rhetoric is to assume that those who indulge in it must be bloodthirsty monsters.	一种解读这些好斗言论的方式是认为执迷于此的都是嗜血狂魔。
A more charitable view is that they suffer from an appalling lack of historical memory and moral imagination.	更善意的观点是他们极度缺乏历史记忆和道德想象力。
None has any personal experience of war.	这些人都没有对战争的个人体验。
And they clearly find it impossible to comprehend the consequences of what they are saying.	他们显然无法理解他们的厥词的后果。
And yet even a cursory acquaintance with fairly recent history is enough to know that “bombing the shit” out of people does little to win wars.	而即便是对最近一段历史的最粗浅的了解也足以让我们知道，把人“炸出屎来”根本无法赢得战争。
It didn’t work in Vietnam, and it is unlikely to work in Syria or Iraq.	这在越南不起作用，在叙利亚或伊拉克也不可能起作用。
Even the Nazis were not defeated by carpet bombing.	就连纳粹也不是被地毯式轰炸打败的。
As postwar studies undertaken by the US and British air forces demonstrated, Russian tanks did more to bring down the Wehrmacht than did aerial bombing of German cities.	美国和英国空军的战后研究表明，俄式坦克对于击败德国国防军的作用要大于对德国城市的轰炸。
This raises the question, suitable for the beginning of a new year, of whether history really can teach us many lessons.	这就引出了一个适合新年的问题，即历史是否真的教会了我们许多教训。
After all, nothing is ever exactly the same as what went before.	毕竟，现在发生的事情永远不会与过去完全相同。
It is probably true that we cannot expect history to tell us what to do in any given crisis.	也许我们确实无法期待历史告诉我们在某场危机中应该怎么做。
But, given that some patterns of human behavior recur, knowledge about the past can help us understand our own times better.	但是，人类的某些行为模式会反复发生，因此关于过去的知识能够帮助我们更好地理解现时代。
The problem is that politicians (and commentators) often pick the wrong examples to bolster their ideological positions.	问题在于政客（和评论家）常常选取错误的例子论证他们的意识形态立场。
For example, because few people apparently can think back further than World War II, examples from the 1930s and 1940s are the most commonly abused.	比如，能将记忆追溯到二战前的人非常少，因此20世纪30和40年代的例子最常被滥用。
Whenever we are encouraged to oppose a dictator, the specter of Adolf Hitler is invoked, and the ghosts of 1938 are resurrected to counter skepticism about hasty “preemptive” war.	每当我们被鼓励反对某位独裁者，希特勒的幽灵就会浮现，而1938年常常被用来反驳质疑仓促的“预防性”战争的人。
Those who had doubts about George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq were “appeasers,” akin to Neville Chamberlain.	质疑小布什入侵伊拉克的人被认为都是张伯伦式的“绥靖派 ” 。
Our almost exclusive focus on Nazis and WWII blinds us to other – and possibly more instructive – historical parallels.	我们的关注点几乎完全集中在纳粹和二战，而对其他可能更具说明性的历史案例视而不见。
The terrible wars in the Middle East today, pitting revolutionary religious sects and tribal chiefs against ruthless dictatorships backed by one great power or another, have much more in common with the Thirty Years War that devastated much of Germany and central Europe from 1618 to 1648.	今天可怕的中东战争是革命宗派和部落领袖反抗受到某个列强支持的独裁统治的战争，它们与1618—1648年间让德国和中欧大部化为焦土的三十年战争更加相似。
For three decades, marauding armies murdered, plundered, and tortured their way through villages and towns.	在三十年中，军队如游寇般一路烧杀抢掠。
Many who weren’t killed died of starvation or disease, spread by vast numbers of armed men.	许多没有被杀的也死于大量武装部队散播的饥饿和疾病。
Like today’s wars, the Thirty Years War is often assumed to have been an essentially religious conflict, but between Catholics and Protestants.	和今天的战争相似，三十年战争常常被认为主要是宗教冲突，只不过发生在天主教和新教之间。
In fact, again like the current violence in which the Arab world is embroiled, it was much more complicated.	事实上，和今天阿拉伯世界深陷其中的暴力相同，三十年战争要复杂得多。
Mercenary soldiers, Protestant or Catholic, switched sides whenever it suited them, while the Vatican backed the Protestant German princes, Catholic France backed the Protestant Dutch Republic, and many other alliances were forged across sectarian lines.	雇佣兵 — — 不管是新教徒还是天主教徒 — — 只要形势不对就倒戈，梵蒂冈支持信奉新教的德国贵族，天主教法国支持新教荷兰共和国，其他许多联盟也包括众多不同宗派。
In reality, the Thirty Years War was a struggle for European hegemony between the Bourbon and Habsburg monarchies.	事实上，三十年战争是波旁和哈布斯堡王朝争夺欧洲霸权的战争。
As long as one was not strong enough to dominate the other, the war continued, causing horrendous suffering among innocent peasants and city dwellers.	只要一方不足以强大到主宰另一方，战争就无法结束，导致无辜农民和城市居民惨遭横祸。
And just like in the Middle East today, other major powers – France, Denmark, and Sweden, among others – took part, backing one side or the other, hoping to gain advantage for themselves.	而正如今天的中东，其他主要力量 — — 法国、丹麦、瑞典等 — — 也参与其中，支持其中一方，以期从中渔利。
The similarity to the wars in Syria and Iraq is striking.	叙利亚和伊拉克战争有着惊人的相似性。
ISIS is a brutal Sunni rebellion against Shia rulers.	伊斯兰国是逊尼派对什叶派统治的残酷反抗。
The US opposes it, but so do Iran, a Shia power, and Saudi Arabia, which is run by Sunni despots.	美国反对它，什叶派力量伊朗和逊尼派君主统治的沙特阿拉伯亦然。
The main axis of conflict in the Middle East is not religious or sectarian, but geopolitical: the struggle for regional hegemony between Saudi Arabia and Iran.	中东的主要冲突轴心不是宗教或宗派，而是地缘政治：沙特阿拉伯和伊朗争夺地区霸权。
Both have backers among the major powers, and both deliberately whip up religious fanatics; but theological differences are not the key to understanding the escalation of violence.	两国都有主要力量撑腰，都有意识地借助宗教狂热；但神学方面的分歧并不是理解暴力升级的关键。
What is to be learned from all this?	从所有这些当中我们可以学到什么？
Some might argue that only a thorough religious reformation will bring about long-term peace in the Middle East.	有人会说，只有彻底的宗教改革能给中东带来长期和平。
But, though reformation of Islam might be desirable in itself, it will not bring an end to the war at hand.	但是，即便伊斯兰教改革本身值得追求，但它无法结束当下的战争。
Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad is not fighting for a particular sect of Islam (the Alawites in his case), but for his survival.	叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德不是在为某个伊斯兰教派而战（他属于阿拉维派 ） ， 而是在为自己的生存而战。
ISIS is not battling for Sunni orthodoxy, but for a revolutionary caliphate.	伊斯兰国不是在为逊尼派正统而战，而是在为革命的哈里发而战。
The struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran is not religious, but political.	沙特阿拉伯和伊朗之间的战争不是宗教战争，而是政治战争。
There were moments during the Thirty Years War when a political settlement might have been possible.	在三十年战争期间，不乏有可能实现政治和解的时刻。
But the will to take advantage of such opportunities was lacking; one party or another still sought greater advantage by fighting on (or encouraging others to do so).	但缺乏抓住这些机会的意愿；总有一方仍试图通过继续战斗（或鼓励其他人继续战斗）赢得更大优势。
It would be a tragedy if similar opportunities were missed today.	如果今天也错失这样的机会，将是一个悲剧。
Settlements demand compromise.	和解需要妥协。
Enemies will have to talk to one another.	敌人将不得不互相谈判。
Braggadocio about carpet bombing, and accusations of appeasement against those who try to negotiate, will only prolong the agony, if not cause an even greater catastrophe.	自负于地毯式轰炸、指责试图谈判者为绥靖，这些做法只能延长痛苦甚至造成更大的灾难。
And that will affect almost all of us.	而这将影响到我们几乎每一个人。
	
What Can Save the Euro?	怎样拯救欧元？
NEW YORK – Just when it seemed that things couldn’t get worse, it appears that they have.	纽约 — — 有时候事情看上去并不会变得很糟，但实际上却并非如此。
Even some of the ostensibly “responsible” members of the eurozone are facing higher interest rates.	即就是欧元区一些看似“负责”的成员国也将面临更高的利率。
Economists on both sides of the Atlantic are now discussing not just whether the euro will survive, but how to ensure that its demise causes the least turmoil possible.	而大西洋两岸的欧美经济学家们现在讨论的已经不是欧元能否生存下来的问题，而是如何确保欧元体系的崩溃只带来最小的动荡。
It is increasingly evident that Europe’s political leaders, for all their commitment to the euro’s survival, do not have a good grasp of what is required to make the single currency work.	尽管欧洲各国领导致力于挽救欧元，但在维系欧元运作的必要措施方面，各国领导对此的认识缺陷却逐渐暴露出来。
The prevailing view when the euro was established was that all that was required was fiscal discipline – no country’s fiscal deficit or public debt, relative to GDP, should be too large.	欧元体系建立伊始，主流观点认为维系欧元体系的运作只需在财政方面进行约束，即，各成员国的财政赤字或公共债务应与各国国内生产总值相适应。
But Ireland and Spain had budget surpluses and low debt before the crisis, which quickly turned into large deficits and high debt.	经济危机前，爱尔兰和西班牙仍有预算结余，并保持较低的债务值。 然而，很快一切都化为乌有，两国都陷入财政赤字，债台高筑。
So now European leaders say that it is the current-account deficits of the eurozone’s member countries that must be kept in check.	所以，当今欧洲各国领导都指出控制各成员国的经常项目赤字才是当务之急。
In that case, it seems curious that, as the crisis continues, the safe haven for global investors is the United States, which has had an enormous current-account deficit for years.	如果真是这样，那么随着经济危机的蔓延，美国这个常年保持经常项目赤字的国家却成了全球投资者的避风港，就显得不合常理了。
So, how will the European Union distinguish between “good” current-account deficits – a government creates a favorable business climate, generating inflows of foreign direct investment – and “bad” current-account deficits?	而欧盟将如何分辨政府为创造有利投资环境以及增加外国直接投资而造成的“良性”经常性项目赤字和“不良”经常性项目赤字呢？
Preventing bad current-account deficits would require far greater intervention in the private sector than the neoliberal and single-market doctrines that were fashionable at the euro’s founding would imply.	要想避免“不良”经常性项目赤字，那么对于私营部门的干预则应该远远大于欧元区建立时颇受欢迎的新自由主义以及单一市场原则所倡导的程度。
In Spain, for example, money flowed into the private sector from private banks.	以西班牙为例，私营部门的资金主要来自私有银行。
Should such irrational exuberance force the government, willy-nilly, to curtail public investment?	而受这种非理性繁荣的影响，政府是否应被迫削减公共投资呢？
Does this mean that government must decide which capital flows – say into real-estate investment, for example – are bad, and so must be taxed or otherwise curbed?	而这是否又意味着政府必须决定这其中哪一种资金流是不良的（如，投资房产的资金 ） ， 从而这种投资是否应缴纳税款或者被限制呢？
To me, this makes sense, but such policies should be anathema to the EU’s free-market advocates.	我个人觉得这样的政策会行之有效。 但是对于欧盟自由市场的倡导者而言，这些政策只会招来极大的不满。
The quest for a clear, simple answer recalls the discussions that have followed financial crises around the world.	为了寻求一个明确简单的答案。 人们的注意力再一次集中到每次金融危机过后的讨论之上。
After each crisis, an explanation emerges, which the next crisis shows to be wrong, or at least inadequate.	每一次金融危机结束，总有相应的解释出现。 而这些解释总是在下一次金融危机到来时被推翻或者至少证明其不全面。
The 1980’s Latin American crisis was caused by excessive borrowing; but that could not explain Mexico’s 1994 crisis, so it was attributed to under-saving.	二十世纪八十年代的拉美经济危机是由于过度贷款造成的。 而这个解释却不适用于1994年的墨西哥经济危机，因为这一次危机的原因是由于储蓄不足。
	而紧接着到了东亚经济危机。
Then came East Asia, which had high savings rates, so the new explanation was “governance.” But this, too, made little sense, given that the Scandinavian countries – which have the most transparent governance in the world – had suffered a crisis a few years earlier.	东亚拥很高的储蓄率，但这一次问题出在“管理方式”之上。 在享有世界上最透明管理方式的斯堪的纳维亚国家几年前遭受金融危机时，这个解释则又成了无稽之谈。
There is, interestingly, a common thread running through all of these cases, as well as the 2008 crisis: financial sectors behaved badly and failed to assess creditworthiness and manage risk as they were supposed to do.	但值得注意的是，这些金融危机，包括2008年的金融危机，都有一个共通的线索，即，金融行业表现欠佳，未能准确评估信用度，在危机出现时，未能及时处理。
These problems will occur with or without the euro.	无论有没有欧元，这些问题都会出现。
But the euro has made it more difficult for governments to respond.	但是对于政府来说，欧元的出现使得这些问题变得更加棘手。
And the problem is not just that the euro took away two key tools for adjustment – the interest rate and the exchange rate – and put nothing in their place, or that the European Central Bank’s mandate is to focus on inflation, whereas today’s challenges are unemployment, growth, and financial stability.	而现在的问题不仅只是：欧元的崩溃将使得各国丧失两大调节方式（利率以及汇率 ） ， 以及欧洲央行的权限主要集中于控制通货膨胀；而且，现在各国政府还面临失业，增长速度慢，以及金融市场不稳定的挑战。
Without a common fiscal authority, the single market opened the way to tax competition – a race to the bottom to attract investment and boost output that could be freely sold throughout the EU.	失去了共同财政管理体系的统一市场只会为税收竞争敞开大门。 各国会通过降低税收的方式来吸引投资并增加可以在欧盟区自由交易产品的产出。
Moreover, free labor mobility means that individuals can choose whether to pay their parents’ debts: young Irish can simply escape repaying the foolish bank-bailout obligations assumed by their government by leaving the country.	再者，自由劳动流动意味着个人可以选择是否为自己的父母辈还债 — — 爱尔兰的年青人只需要离开自己的国家就不用在为政府愚蠢的银行担保买单。
Of course, migration is supposed to be good, as it reallocates labor to where its return is highest.	当然，移民可以使劳动力按照收益重新分配，本身当然无可厚非。
But this kind of migration actually undermines productivity.	但是，这种方式的移民实际是在削弱生产力。
Migration is, of course, part of the adjustment mechanism that makes America work as a single market with a single currency.	当然，移民正是美国调节机制的一部分。 它使得美国能够以使用单一货币的统一市场的形式来运作。
Even more important is the federal government’s role in helping states that face, say, high unemployment, by allocating additional tax revenue to them – the so-called “transfer union” so loathed by many Germans.	更为重要的是：联邦政府通过分配更多的额外税收来缓解各州面临的问题（如高失业率）时所扮演的角色，即所谓的“转移联盟 ” ， 让很多德国人深恶痛绝。
But the US is also willing to accept the depopulation of entire states that cannot compete. (Some point out that this means that America’s corporations can buy senators from such states at a lower price.)	而美国同样也愿意在那些失去竞争力的州采取减少人口的方式来解决问题（一些人指出美国企业可以通过这种方法来从这些竞争力低的州购买议员的席位 ） 。
But are European countries with lagging productivity willing to accept depopulation?	但是生产力相对落后的欧洲愿意通过减少人口来解决问题吗？
Alternatively, are they willing to face the pain of “internal” devaluation, a process that failed under the gold standard and is failing under the euro?	或者，欧洲愿意忍痛采取“内部”贬值的方式 — — 这种方式在过去在黄金标准体系下曾经惨遭失败，而在如今在欧元体系也下日趋崩溃？
Even if those from Europe’s northern countries are right in claiming that the euro would work if effective discipline could be imposed on others (I think they are wrong), they are deluding themselves with a morality play.	即便一些欧洲北部国家所宣称的通过采取一些有效的管理方法可以使欧元重获生机方法是正确的。 （我个人认为是错误的）他们也不过是在上演一出自欺欺人的道德剧罢了。
It is fine to blame their southern compatriots for fiscal profligacy, or, in the case of Spain and Ireland, for letting free markets have free reign, without seeing where that would lead.	当然，采取奢侈财务政策的南部同盟，或者将自由市场等同为没有限制，对于后果毫无顾忌的西班牙和爱尔兰本身责无旁贷。
But that doesn’t address today’s problem: huge debts, whether a result of private or public miscalculations, must be managed within the euro framework.	但指责并不能解决今天面临的问题：欧盟的巨额债务，无论是无私有还是公有行业造成的，必须从起自身出发着手解决。
Public-sector cutbacks today do not solve the problem of yesterday’s profligacy; they simply push economies into deeper recessions.	往昔欠下的巨额债务并不能通过减少当下公共部门的预算来减少。 这样做只会适得其反，使经济更为衰退。
Europe’s leaders know this.	欧洲的领导人明白这一点。
They know that growth is needed.	他们知道欧洲需要经济增长。
But, rather than deal with today’s problems and find a formula for growth, they prefer to deliver homilies about what some previous government should have done.This may be satisfying for the sermonizer, but it won’t solve Europe’s problems – and it won’t save the euro.	但是与其去解决问题，寻求经济增长的方式，还不如喋喋不休地去指责前几任政府的失职。 对于说教者而言这是个让人满意的行为，但是这并不会解决欧洲的问题，当然也拯救不了欧元。
	
What China Wants in 2012	2012年，中国想要什么
BEIJING – With economic globalization and the advent of a multi-polar world, China and other emerging countries are clearly set to play much more important roles not only in 2012, but in the coming decades.	北京 — — 随着经济的全球化以及多极世界的形成，中国和其他新兴国家必定会扮演更加重要的角色，不仅在2012年如此，在今后的数十年间都是如此，这已是众人皆知了。
As China’s economic power and influence in the world economy have increased following the financial crisis of 2008, the idea has been floated that China and the United States should co-lead the world under some sort of “G-2” arrangement.	2008年金融危机以来，随着中国在世界经济中的经济实力和影响，出现了一种新观点：中国和美国应该被称为“G2 ” ， 共同领导整个世界。
But such a G-2 framework is not consistent with China’s independent foreign policy, nor with the general trend towards wider dispersion of geopolitical power within the international community.	但这种G2框架与中国的独立外交并不一致，与国际社会地缘政治日渐分散化的趋势也不相符。
Although China’s senior leadership will change this year, this position will not change.	尽管中国的高层领导人将在今年易届，但这一立场是不会随之改变的。
Indeed, when China’s Premier Wen Jiabao visited Prague in May 2009 for the 11th China-European Union summit, he explained that China is opposed to the G-2 concept.	事实上，温家宝总理在2009年5月访问布拉格出席中欧峰会时就解释说，中国反对G2的概念。
It is China’s firm intention never to seek hegemony, nor to support global domination by a small minority of countries.	中国永不追求霸权，也不支持一小撮国家主导全球，这是中国的坚定立场。
What China does believe in is deepening cooperation with all of the world’s major regions.	中国坚信，世界各主要地区的合作将越来越深入。
Consider Europe – a splendid and time-honored civilization, and now a major player on the world stage.	比如欧洲，这里有着历史悠久的灿烂文明，也是今日世界舞台的主角。
The progressive deepening of EU integration has brought dynamic vigor to the European continent; despite Europe’s current difficulties, it still boasts extraordinary overall strength and international influence.	欧盟一体化的深化进程给欧洲大陆带来了动力；尽管欧洲当前遇到了一些困难，但它仍具有引以为豪的实力和国际影响力。
China has always supported European integration, and hopes that the EU will become a pillar of international order.	中国一贯支持欧洲一体化，也希望欧盟能成为国际秩序之一级。
In the wake of the global financial crisis and the eurozone’s sovereign-debt crisis, China has bought government bonds, made direct investments, and sent business delegations to Europe.	随着全球金融危机和欧元区主权债务危机的爆发，中国已经购买了欧洲政府债券、对欧洲进行了直接投资，并派遣了商业代表团赴欧。
During Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Zapatero’s visit to Beijing in April 2011, Wen reaffirmed China’s willingness to continue purchasing Spanish government bonds as a further demonstration of our support for Europe’s efforts to emerge from its crisis.	2011年西班牙首相萨帕特罗访问中国时，温家宝总理确认，中国愿意继续购买西班牙政府债券，以进一步表明我们对欧洲应对危机的支持。
Moreover, China’s huge market and labor pool have created important opportunities for Europe.	此外，中国的巨大市场和劳动力储备也未欧洲创造了重要机会。
In this new multi-polar era, China and Europe must work together, and they are now at a critical moment if they are to deepen their cooperation.	在这个新的多极时代，中国和欧洲必须精诚合作，而如若双方意欲深化合作，那么现在就是关键时刻。
What we do to share opportunities, meet challenges, and pursue development will be directly relevant not only to our own peoples’ welfare, but also to the world’s future.	我们分享机会、直面挑战和追求发展的举措不仅直接与我们自己的人民福祉有关，也关系到世界的未来。
China-EU cooperation will be essential to maintaining global peace and stability.	中欧合作将是维持世界和平与稳定的关键。
We share a commitment to resolving international issues through political means, and both sides have already played a constructive role in addressing global challenges such as climate change, terrorism, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.	我们对通过政治途径解决国际问题有着共同承诺，双方在应对气候变化、恐怖主义、大规模杀伤新武器扩散方面已做出了建设性贡献。
The parallel launch of China’s 12th Five-Year Plan and Europe’s 2020 Strategy has also helped to deepen our cooperation.	同时公布中国的十二五规划和欧洲的2020战略也有益于深化我们的合作。
China and Europe worked together after 2008 to prevent a global financial meltdown, oppose protectionism, and promote reform of the international financial system, thus facilitating worldwide economic recovery.	2008年以来，中国和欧洲精诚合作，以防止全球金融体系的崩溃、反对恐怖主义、促进国际金融体系改革从而助力世界经济复苏。
China also takes its relations with the US very seriously.	中国对于和美国的关系也很重视。
Indeed, our bilateral relationship is among the most important in the international community.	事实上，我们的双边关系是国际社会中最重要的关系之一。
That relationship has gone through some rough patches since diplomatic ties were established in 1979, but, overall, it has continued to grow and benefit both sides.	自1979年双方建立外交关系以来，中美关系经历了不少困难时刻，但总体而言在持续改善，双方均因此获益良多。
Today, China and the US share more interests than ever, and there are encouraging prospects for still broader cooperation.	如今，中美的共同利益之大前所未见，双方的合作前景令人鼓舞。
When President Hu Jintao visited Washington, DC in January 2011, he and President Barack Obama agreed to build what Hu referred to as “a China-US cooperative partnership based on respect and mutual benefit.”	2011年1月，胡锦涛主席访问华盛顿，他和奥巴马总统同意建设胡主席所谓的“基于尊重和共同利益的中美合作伙伴关系 。 ”
They reaffirmed their deference for each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and reached agreements on major strategic issues, including efforts to strengthen cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and in multilateral institutions, and to respond jointly to regional and global challenges to peace and stability, for example, on the Korean Peninsula.	两人重申彼此尊重主权完整，并在包括强化亚太地区合作和多变制度、联合应对地区和全球和平与稳定的挑战（如朝鲜半岛问题）等重要战略问题上达成了一致。
China is the world’s largest developing country; Europe is the largest bloc of developed countries; and the US is the largest single developed country.	中国是世界上最大的发展中国家，欧洲是世界上最大的发达国家联合体，美国是世界上最大的单一发达国家。
Together, we account for nearly a third of humanity and two-thirds of the world economy.	三国加起来占据着全球三分之一的人口和三分之二的经济总量。
As the three major global powers, China, the EU, and the US must strengthen their cooperation, and must work with the rest of the world to face the complex international issues that challenge us all.	作为全球三大势力，中国、欧盟和美国必须强化合作，与世界其他国家精诚合作，应对困扰我们所有人的复杂多变的国际问题。
Together, we must shoulder the great task of upholding world peace and promoting common development.	我们必须联合起来承担维持世界和平、促进共同发展的重大任务。
While China is committed to its own independent foreign policy, it cannot achieve development in isolation.	中国做出了独立外交政策的承诺，但它无法单枪匹马地发展。
Likewise, the world cannot develop without China.	类似地，世界也无法在没有中国的情况下发展。
Hu once said that the twenty-first century should be a century of peace, development, and cooperation.	胡主席曾说，21世纪应该是和平、发展和合作的世纪。
China is willing to join with the EU, the US, and the rest of the world to realize the potential of a truly harmonious world.	中国愿意与欧盟、美国和世界其他国家一起，实现真正和谐的社会。
	
Over the Cliff We Go	跨越财政悬崖
BERKELEY – Unless something unexpected happens, the United States’ many legislated reductions in taxes over the past 12 years – all of which have been explicitly temporary – will expire simultaneously at the start of 2013.	伯克利 — — 除非发生意外，否则12年来美国众多法律规定的减税措施（其中很多都被明确规定为临时性措施）将于2013年伊始同时终止。
American tax rates will revert overnight to their Clinton-era levels.	一夜之间，美国将恢复克林顿时代的税率。
Some of these reductions were implemented to fight what was seen four years ago as a temporary downturn.	实行减税措施是为了抵御四年前暂时性的经济低迷。
Although their supporters wanted to make them permanent, claiming that they were temporary allowed for the circumvention of procedural requirements in the legislative process that Democrats had created in a vain effort to guarantee fiscal sanity.	但支持者希望实现其永久化，称当时只是为了规避立法过程中民主党保证财政合理性的无效的程序性规定才将其确定为临时性措施。
The immediate increase in tax rates is only part of the story.	减税计划到期后税率即刻调升还不是全部问题。
At the same time, automatic reductions in the defense budget and “discretionary” domestic spending – agreed to by both Democrats and Republicans in the summer of 2011 – will take effect.	与此同时，民主共和两党于2011年夏达成的自动削减国防预算和“自由裁量”国内消费的协议也将开始实施。
Couple these tax increases and spending cuts with the provisions of “Obamacare,” the US health-care reform championed by President Barack Obama, and, as of January 1, 2013, America’s long-run structural budget deficit disappears.	增税减支措施将于2013年1月1日生效，辅之以奥巴马总统倡导的“奥巴马医改”即可消除美国的长期结构性财政赤字。
The restored tax rates will, for the foreseeable future, be sufficient to support the US defense establishment, the growing US social-insurance system, and a moderate – albeit inadequate and suboptimal – amount of other “discretionary” federal spending.	恢复后的税率在可以预见的未来足以支撑美国的国防建设、不断发展的社保系统和虽不理想但却适度稳健的其他“自由裁量”的联邦开支。
The US national debt/GDP ratio will be on track to fall from its current level of 75% to 50% by 2035.	美国国债占国内生产总值的比例将有望从目前的75%下降到2035年的50 % 。
Moreover, the US will begin running primary budget surpluses – the fiscal balance minus interest payments on existing debt – by 2015.	此外截止2015年，美国将开始实现基本预算盈余 — — 在扣除现有债务利息支出后实现财政收支平衡。
So why isn’t the prospect of going over the fiscal cliff greeted with enthusiasm?	那么民众为什么对平安跨过财政悬崖的前景并不热衷？
Yes, there will be big spending cuts – which will hit defense contractors, doctors with Medicare patients, and all who benefit from or rely on government discretionary spending – and substantial tax increases.	是的，我们需要大幅削减开支 — — 而这将打击国防承包商、为联邦医疗保险（Medicare）患者看病的医生和受惠于政府可自由支配开支的所有人 — — 同时大幅增加税收。
But, to balance the budget in the long run, either taxes have to go up or spending has to go down relative to some baseline, or both.	但为实现长期预算平衡，税收必须相对于一定基准上升而开支则必须下降，或者两者兼而有之。
There are two reasons why deficit hawks are not declaring victory.	赤字鹰派没有宣布胜利有两个原因。
First, many who call themselves deficit hawks are really spending hawks: they believe that US social insurance is too generous to the unemployed, the disabled, the elderly, and the sick, and that by far the best policy is to cut back on such programs rather than raise taxes to pay for them.	其一，许多自诩的赤字鹰派其实应该叫支出鹰派：他们认为美国社会保险对失业者、残疾人、老年人和患病者过于慷慨，因此迄今为止的最佳政策不是提高税收，而是削减社保开支。
But, they fear that calling for spending cuts will be unpopular, unlike, they hope, demands to balance the budget.	但他们害怕削减开支的要求不得人心，而平衡预算就不会引起那么大的反应。
For them, the problem with the fiscal cliff is that it does not cut spending enough and raises taxes too much.	对他们而言，财政悬崖的问题在于加税加得过多，而开支减得不够。
Second, and more important for those who worry about the US economy’s health, the process is not well-described by the term “fiscal cliff.”	第二点在为美国经济健康忧心忡忡者看来尤为重要，即“财政悬崖”一词无法贴切地形容整个过程。
It is, rather, an austerity bomb that hits an economy in which unemployment remains high, the employment-to-population ratio remains horrifyingly low, and there are only feeble signs that the large gap between current and potential output is closing.	这相当于命中高失业率经济体的一枚紧缩炸弹，就业人口占总人口的比例依然低得惊人，且只有微弱迹象表明当前及潜在产值之间的巨大落差正在逐步弥合。
The past two months’ run-up to the austerity bomb’s detonation has already reduced projected real GDP growth in 2013 from 3% to 2.5%, and has raised likely end-2013 unemployment from 7.5% to 7.7%.	紧缩炸弹爆炸前两个月的准备阶段，2013年实际国内生产总值预期增长已经从3%降至2.5 % ， 2013年底预期失业率也从7.5%增加到7.7 % 。
Each day from January 1 to June 30 that the damage continues will have a roughly linear impact on economic performance in 2013, reducing the likely full-year real GDP growth rate by 0.0084% – and only if a deal is ultimately reached that would have caused no economic harm in 2013 had it been reached on November 10, 2012.	2013年1月1日至6月30日的每一个日夜都会对经济表现造成大致线性的影响，导致可能的全年实际国内生产总值增速下降0.0084 % — —只有在2012年11月10日前最终达成一致才不会损害2013年的经济发展。
If no deal is reached by June 30, America’s likely 2013 real GDP growth rate will be -0.5%, with the likely unemployment rate returning to 8.9%.	如果到6月30日还未达成一致，美国2013年实际国内生产总值增长率将有可能降至负0.5 % ， 而失业率有可能重新升至8.9 % 。
Spending cuts and tax increases that in the long run restore fiscal sanity and balance are good.	长远看能削减开支、增加税收，恢复财政平衡稳健的措施都有好处。
Having them all hit a weak, still-depressed economy simultaneously is not good.	但任由它们同时打击仍然疲弱低迷的经济却绝非明智的选择。
Thus, US officials face four tasks.	因此，美国官员必须完成四项任务。
First, Republicans and Democrats must negotiate a bipartisan agreement to stretch out the spending cuts and tax increases that take effect on January 1, 2013.	首先，共和及民主两党必须谈判两党协议，从2013年1月1日起削减开支并增加税收。
That way, they will affect the economy gradually over five years, rather than all at once.	相关措施对经济影响不是一次性的，而将在今后五年内逐步释放。
Second, the Federal Reserve should expand its quantitative easing and forward guidance programs.	其次，美联储应扩大其量化宽松政策和前瞻性的指导方案。
Consumers will be spending less in 2013, owing to higher taxes, as will government, which means that someone has to be spending more.	2013年消费者和政府将因为税收提高而紧缩开支，这也意味着有些领域需要多花钱。
Housing construction and exports are the obvious candidates, and both can be boosted somewhat by more aggressive balance-sheet operations by the Fed, together with promises of continued low nominal interest rates and higher inflation in the medium term.	住宅建设和出口是显而易见的候选领域，美联储对资产负债表的积极运作，加之中期维持低名义利率和高通胀的承诺将在一定程度上刺激上述两个领域的复苏。
Third, the large government-sponsored mortgage enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, should be used as macroeconomic-policy tools to restore housing construction to its long-term trend level.	第三，政府资助的大型抵押贷款企业房利美和房地美应当发挥宏观经济政策工具的作用，让住房建设恢复到其长期趋势水平。
This should have been done five years ago, but better late than never.	原本五年前就应当这样做，但亡羊补牢、犹未为晚。
Finally, and also five years too late, the US Treasury secretary should announce that while the strong-dollar doctrine was appropriate (and in America’s interest) during the dot-com boom, the country needs a weak dollar in the aftermath of the austerity bomb’s detonation.	最后，虽然本来也应在五年前着手，但美国财政部长盖特纳应当宣布，因为网络繁荣期间盛行（符合美国利益的）字符串美元主义，美国在紧缩炸弹爆炸后需要弱势美元。
Reaching the wrong agreement to defuse the austerity bomb, or cushion the economy from its impact, would merely recreate America’s long-run structural budget deficit – a very bad outcome.	就拆除紧缩炸弹或化解经济影响达成错误的共识只会重新造成美国的长期结构性预算赤字，这个结果非常糟糕。
Failure to take all four steps outlined above all but guarantees renewed recession in America, even if a good agreement is reached on stretching out the tax hikes and spending cuts.	即便就增税减支达成了稳妥的协议，未能实行上述四个步骤就几乎注定了美国将重新陷入经济危机之中。
And if no agreement is reached on that, undertaking the last three steps would at least reduce somewhat the subsequent damage.	如果未能就此达成协议，采取上述三个步骤至少能在一定程度上降低随之而来的损害。
	
What Communism Still Teaches Us	共产主义至今仍留给我们的教训
PRAGUE - The fifteenth anniversary of the Velvet Revolution on November 17, 1989, which brought an end to 41 years of communist dictatorship in Czechoslovakia, is an opportunity to ponder the meaning of moral behavior and free action.	1989年11月17日发生的“丝绒革命”给捷克斯洛伐克长达41年的共产主义独裁政治划上了句号。 今年是其十五周年，是我们思考道德行为和自由行动的意义的契机。
Today we live in a democratic society, but many people - not only in the Czech Republic - still believe that they are not true masters of their destiny.	今天，我们生活在民主社会中，但是许多人 — — 不仅仅在捷克共和国内 — — 仍然相信自己无法真正主宰自己的命运。
They have lost faith that they can really influence political developments, much less influence the direction in which our civilization is evolving.	他们已失去信心，不相信自己能对政治的发展产生现实的影响，更不用说影响我们的文明演进的方向。
During the communist era, most people believed that individual efforts to effect change did not make sense.	在共产主义时期，绝大多数人认为个人的努力没有作用。
Communist leaders insisted that the system was the result of history's objective laws, which could not be challenged, and those who refused this logic were punished - just in case.	共产主义领导人坚称其制度是历史客观规律的产物，是不可动摇的，任何拒不接受这个逻辑的人都要受到惩罚 — — 以防万一。
Unfortunately, the way of thinking that supported Communist dictatorships has not disappeared entirely.	不幸的是，这种支持共产主义独裁政治的思维方式还没有完全消失。
Some politicians and pundits maintain that Communism merely collapsed under its own weight - again, owing to "objective laws" of history.	某些政客和学究还坚持认为共产主义的崩溃是出于其自身的原因 — — 同样属于历史的“客观规律 ” 。
Again, individual responsibility and individual actions are belittled.	个人的责任和个人的行为再次被低估。
Communism, we are told, was only one of the dead ends of Western rationalism; therefore, it was sufficient to wait passively for it to fail.	我们听到的说法是，共产主义只是西方理性主义的死胡同之一；因此，只需要坐等它的消亡即可。
The very same people often believe in other manifestations of inevitability, such as various supposed laws of the market and other "invisible hands" that direct our lives.	同样是这批人还常常相信必然性的其他表现方式，如各种假想中的市场规律和其他指挥我们的生活的“看不见的手 ” 。
As there is not much space in such thinking for individual moral action, social critics are often ridiculed as naive moralists or elitists.	由于这种思想没有给个人的道德行为留下多少空间，社会批评家经常被嘲笑为天真的道德论或精英论者。
Perhaps this is one of the reasons why 15 years after the fall of Communism, we again witness political apathy.	或许这就是为什么在共产主义垮台15年后，我们再次见到政治冷漠现象的原因之一。
Democracy is increasingly seen as a mere ritual.	民主越来越被看作仅仅是一种仪式。
In general, Western societies, it seems, are experiencing a certain crisis of the democratic ethos and active citizenship.	总的说来，西方社会似乎正在经历某种民主思潮和活跃公民的危机。
It is possible that what we are witnessing is a mere change of paradigm, caused by new technologies, and we have nothing to worry about.	也许我们看到的现象只是一种由新的科技引起的范式转变，没有什么好担心的。
But perhaps the problem is deeper: global corporations, media cartels, and powerful bureaucracies are transforming political parties into organizations whose main task is no longer public service, but the protection of specific clienteles and interests.	但是问题的根源也许比这要深刻：全球化的公司、媒体卡特尔、以及强势的官僚制度正在把政党的主要任务转变成不再是服务大众，而是保护特定客户群和利益。
Politics is becoming a battleground for lobbyists; media trivialize serious problems; democracy often looks like a virtual game for consumers, rather than a serious business for serious citizens.	政治正在变成说客的战场；媒体把严肃的问题大事化小；民主常常看起来像是一场消费者的虚拟游戏，而不是严肃的公民面对的严肃问题。
When dreaming about a democratic future, we who were dissidents certainly had some utopian illusions, as we are well aware today.	今天我们清楚，当初在梦想民主的未来时，作为持不同政见者的我们肯定有某些乌托邦式的幻想。
However, we were not mistaken when we argued that Communism was not a mere dead end of Western rationalism.	但是，当我们辩称共产主义并非仅仅是西方理性主义的死胡同时，我们没有错。
Bureaucratization, anonymous manipulation, and emphasis on mass conformism were brought to "perfection" in the Communist system; however, some of the very same threats are with us today.	官僚主义、匿名操纵、以及对群众顺从的强调在共产主义制度中被发挥至“极致 ” ； 然而，同样的威胁中有一部分今天仍然存在。
We were already certain then that if democracy is emptied of values and reduced to a competition of political parties that have "guaranteed" solutions to everything, it can be quite undemocratic.	当时我们就明白，如果掏空民主的价值，把民主降格成“保证”能解决所有问题的政党之间的竞争，这样的民主其实相当不民主。
This is why we put so much emphasis on the moral dimension of politics and a vibrant civil society as counterweights to political parties and state institutions.	这就是为什么我们花如此大的力气强调政治的道德方面和活跃的民众社会，以此作为政党和国家制度的平衡力。
We also dreamed about a more just international order.	我们还梦想建立更加公正的国际秩序。
The end of the bipolar world represented a great opportunity to make the international order more humane.	两极世界的结束是使国际秩序更加人性化的重大机遇。
Instead, we witness a process of economic globalization that has escaped political control and, as such, is causing economic havoc as well as ecological devastation in many parts of the world.	相反，我们看到了经济全球化。 这个过程绕过了政治控制，并在世界上许多地方造成了经济浩劫和生态灾难。
The fall of Communism was an opportunity to create more effective global political institutions based on democratic principles - institutions that could stop what appears to be, in its current form, the self-destructive tendency of our industrial world.	共产主义的垮台是在民主原则的基础上建立更加有效的全球政治制度 — — 一种能够遏止我们的工业化世界当前似乎具有的自毁趋势的制度的机会。
If we do not want to be overrun by anonymous forces, the principles of freedom, equality and solidarity - the foundation of stability and prosperity in Western democracies - must start working globally.	如果我们不想被无名的力量践踏，那么，自由、平等和团结的原则 — — 西方民主的��定和繁荣的基础 — — 就必须在全球范围内发挥作用。
But, above all, it is necessary - just as it was during the Communist era - that we not lose faith in the meaning of alternative centers of thought and civic action.	但是，最重要的是 — — 如同在共产主义时期一样 — — 我们决不能丧失对另一种思维核心和民众行为的意义的信心。
Let's not allow ourselves to be manipulated into believing that attempts to change the "established" order and "objective" laws do not make sense.	我们决不能允许自己在别人的操纵下相信改变“既定”秩序和“客观”规律的努力是无用的。
Let's try to build a global civil society, and let's insist that politics is not just a technology of power, but needs to have a moral dimension.	让我们尝试建立一个全球性的民众社会。 让我们坚持政治不仅是舞弄权力，而更需要有一个道德的层面。
At the same time, politicians in democratic countries need to think seriously about reforms of international institutions, because we desperately need institutions capable of real global governance.	同时，民主国家的政客应该严肃地思考国际制度的改革，因为我们迫切地需要一种能真正覆盖全球的制度。 比如说，我们可以从联合国开始。
We could start, for example, with the United Nations, which, in its current form, is a relic of the situation shortly after the end of World War II. It does not reflect the influence of some new regional powers, while immorally equating countries whose representatives are democratically elected and those whose representatives speak only for themselves or their juntas, at best.	当今的联合国已经沦为二战刚结束时世界格局的遗物，并不能反映某些新兴地区强国的影响力，同时又不道德地把通过民主选举产生代表的国家和那些代表只为自己或（充其量）为其小圈子代言的国家等同起来。
We, the Europeans, have one specific task.	我们欧洲人有一个特殊的任务。
Industrial civilization, which now spans the whole world, originated in Europe.	如今横跨全球的工业文明源自欧洲。
All of its miracles, as well as its terrifying contradictions, can be explained as consequences of an ethos that is initially European.	工业文明带来的所有奇迹，连同那些可怕的副作用，都可以被看作是一种源自欧洲的社会思想的产物。
Therefore, unifying Europe should set an example for the rest of the world regarding how to face the various dangers and horrors that are engulfing us today.	因此，一体化的欧洲应该给世界上其他地区树立一个如何应对充斥于当今世界的各种危险和恐怖的榜样。
Indeed, such a task - which is closely tied to the success of European integration - would be an authentic fulfillment of the European sense of global responsibility.	的确，这样的任务 — — 与欧洲一体化的成功与否密切相关 — — 将真正地实现欧洲人的全球责任感。
And it would be a much better strategy than cheaply blaming America for the contemporary world's various problems.	而且比起草率地斥责美国造成了当今世界的各种问题，这个策略将有意义得多。
	
What Corporate Tax for Europe?	欧洲的公司税制
The European Commission is considering a common model of corporate taxation for the European Union that cannot possibly work.	欧盟委员会正在考虑一种适用于整个欧盟的公司税收共同模式。 但这种模式肯定是行不通的。
Instead, it should consider a simpler, and more viable, alternative that already exists.	因此，它应该考虑一种业已存在的，更为简单和可行的方案。
Corporate income in the EU is currently taxed under widely divergent national rules, based on separate accounting (SA) of income earned in each country.	对公司收入的征税目前欧盟各国都有不同规定。 其基础都是将公司在各个国家所得收入进行分别核算(SA ) 。
Cross-border intra-company transactions are accounted for according to market prices for similar transactions – the so-called “arm’s-length principle” (ALP).	公司内部的跨国交易根据类似交易的市场价核算—即所谓的“常规交易原则 ” ( ALP ) 。
The system is complex, expensive to administer, and can result in double taxation because members usually do not allow full write-offs for losses and tax liabilities incurred abroad.	这种会计体系颇为复杂，管理成本高昂，并可能造成双重征税—因为各成员国通常不允许对发生在国外的亏损和税收义务进行完全销账。
It is also prone to tax evasion, owing to different definitions of corporate income in the member states and the vast opportunities for cheating offered by ALP (since reference market prices often do not exist), not to mention profit-shifting to low-tax jurisdictions.	由于各成员国对公司收入的定义不同，再加上ALP所提供的大量舞弊机会（因为市场参考价通常不存在 ） ， 使得避税非常容易，更别说将利润转移到低税收国家。
The Commission is now proposing that EU companies operating in more than one member state be taxed on a common definition of earned income – the Common Consolidated Base Taxation (CCBT).	欧盟委员会正提议对在一个以上的欧盟成员国营运的欧盟公司采用共同的所得收入征税—即统一共同税基（CCBT ） 。
Earned income would be calculated on a consolidated basis for the group and then “apportioned” among the member states according to a formula reflecting each business unit’s contribution to overall group income.	该体系会把集团公司作为一个整体来计算所得收入，然后按照一个反映各业务单元对集团公司总收入的贡献的公式将收入“分配”到各成员国。
The formula could include such factors as sales, payroll, and tangible assets, as in Canada and the United States, or value-added, adjusted to exclude imports in order to measure the value-added “produced” in each country.	这一公式可能包括销售额、薪资和有形资产等要素（就像加拿大和美国那样 ） ； 或者是计算不包括出口的增加值，以便衡量各国所“产出”的增值部分。
Each member state would remain free to decide the tax rate applicable to its portion of group income.	每个成员国都有权决定适用于该国那一部分公司收入的税率。
Under this approach, taxable income would be determined from the consolidated accounts based on international accounting standards (IAS), which since 2005 have become legally binding for EU-listed companies’ financial reports.	按照这种方式，可征税收入就会通过基于国际会计准则的(IAS)统一账目来决定。 从2005年起，该准则成为欧盟上市公司财务报告的法定标准。
This offers full tax write-offs for losses within company groups, and transfer prices would no longer matter.	这就为公司内部的亏损提供了完全的税务注销，而交易价格也不再重要。
Even so, the Commission’s proposal has fatal shortcomings.	即便如此，欧盟委员会的提案也有着致命的弱点。
For one thing, the factors included in the apportionment formula would in practice be taxed at the national rates, creating fresh incentives for factor- and profit-shifting.	就其中一点来看，分配公式中所包含的要素在实际操作中适用国家税率，这就为要素和利润的转移提供了动机。
But it is two other obstacles that render CCBT hopeless.	但真正让CCBT实行无望的还是另外两个障碍。
First, the IAS responds to the information needs of financial investors, but it does not provide a reliable definition of income for tax purposes.	首先，IAS回应的是金融投资者的信息需求，但却并没有为税收目的而提供一个公司收入的定义。
The accrual principle typical of financial accounting is incompatible with tax systems’ realization principle.	金融会计中典型的应计原则和税收体系中的实现原则并不兼容。
Moreover, the IAS leaves the allocation of profit and losses to different fiscal years largely undetermined, with each member state choosing different solutions.	此外，IAS在很大程度上没有对损益在不同财政年度的分配作明确规定，而每个成员国在这方面都选择了不同的方案。
Second, common legal rules on group consolidation do not exist; indeed, many EU countries’ commercial law contains no legal definition of a group.	其次，在集团公司统一核算方面并没有共同的法规；的确，在许多欧盟国家的商法中都没有对集团公司的法律定义。
The attribution of companies to a common group would need to be based on legal control, that is, ownership of some defined threshold of equity – 51% or higher.	多家公司和同一个集团的归属关系需要以合法的控制为基础，即要有某种明确的股份门槛—51%及以上。
But a much lower share of equity often is sufficient to secure de facto control, thus encouraging groups to adapt their capital structure – moving firms in and out of the group’s boundaries – to minimize tax liabilities.	但通常通过低得多的股份也能获得实际上的控制权，因此这就鼓励了各集团调整其资本结构—将公司在集团的边界内外挪移—从而使税收义务最小化。
Clearly, CCBT is a non-starter.	显然，CCBT无法启动。
But this doesn’t mean that EU companies are condemned to live with 25 different national tax systems.	但这并不意味着欧盟的公司们不得不应对25个不同的国家税收体系。
The idea of a common tax base must be preserved in order to simplify the system and narrow the scope for profit-shifting.	必须保留共同税基以简化税制，并缩小利润转移的范围。
However, a radical change in approach is required: the notion of income as a basis for corporate taxation should be scrapped altogether.	但这就需要进行一种激进的改革：将收入作为公司税基础的概念应该被完全废止。
Referring to corporate income made sense when company taxation was seen as a “back stop” within a system of progressive taxation of personal incomes.	当公司税被视为个人所得税递进税制中的“定位杆”时，参考公司收入才是有意义的。
But most countries have now adopted “dual” income taxation that treat the fruits of capital more leniently than other personal income.	但现在大多数国家都采用了“双重”收入税制，对待资本收益要比对待其他个人收入宽松。
More importantly, the notion of corporate income is inherently arbitrary, for it is based on correct measurement of capital consumption in each tax period, which has become less and less reliable owing to the increased importance of intangibles in the value of companies.	更为重要的是，公司收入的概念在本质上是武断的，因为它是基于对每一税期内资本消费的正确度量。 但随着无形资产对公司价值的重要性的增加，这种度量正变得越来越不可靠。
Moreover, any tax whose proceeds increase in line with company returns is bound to discourage investment.	另外，任何税收的递增如果和公司收益联动必定会挫伤投资。
This disincentive disappears if the corporate tax base is decoupled from current profits and linked to some broad measure of activity.	如果公司税基不与目前的利润挂钩，而是和某些更广泛的衡量标准联系，那么这种挫伤因素就会消失。
Indeed, this would create an incentive for each company to outperform the average, since above-average profits would go untaxed.	的确，这样就能激励每一家公司都努力增收，超过平均水平，因为超过平均水平部分的利润是免税的。
Another reason to scrap income and move to presumptive taxation of corporate activities stems from the EU’s decentralized nature.	另一个废止收入税基，转向针对公司经营活动的假定税基的理由来自欧盟分散化的特点。
While taxing the return on capital at the national level could discourage investment, taxing companies in exchange for location advantages might not.	虽然在国家层面上对资本收益征税可能会挫伤投资，但对公司收税以换取区位优势的做法则可能不会。
Countries that offer world-class infrastructure, high-skill staff, and simple business rules may be well entitled to ask companies to pay a commensurate tax in return.	提供世界级基础设施、高素质的员工和简明的商务法规的国家可能有资格向公司征收与其营商环境相称的税。
In sum, the EU “federal” corporate tax should be thought of as a benefit tax, based on a broad measure of activity, applied at a moderate rate, and unrelated to current returns; nor should it be deductible from other taxes.	总之，欧盟的“联邦”公司税应该被看作是一种福利税，它以对广泛的经营行为的度量为基础，采用适中的税率，不与当前收益挂钩；它也不应该从其他税收中扣除。
Among the various options under consideration, the value-added tax base – perhaps averaged over a number of years – looks best, since the accounting and tax-assessment infrastructures already exist.	在考虑中的各种不同方案里，增值税基—可能在过去若干年里表现平平—似乎是最佳方案。 因为它的会计���税收评估基本框架已经到位了。
Of course, value-added includes profits, and to this extent the incentive for companies to manipulate transfer prices may reappear.	当然，增加值中包括利润，在这一程度上，公司操纵交易价格的动机可能还会出现。
But the incentive would be much weakened, because gross returns typically represent a fairly small share of total value-added.	但这一动机会被极大弱化，因为毛利润通常只代表着全部增加值中的较小一部分。
This model leaves the assessment and administration of corporate taxes entirely in the hands of member states, and would not require harmonization of legal and accounting rules.	这一模式将公司税的评估和管理完全交到各成员国手中，并且也不需要法律和会计规则的协调。
It would be transparent, simple, and easy to administer.	它将会是透明、简单和易于管理的。
The gigantic apparatus for managing transfer prices and tax credit claims with foreign tax authorities could be dismantled.	如此一来，管理交易价格和国外课税扣除申报的庞大机构也可以撤销了。
Indeed, the only losers would be Europe’s outsized army of tax lawyers and accountants.	的确，如果实施该税制，唯一的输家将会是欧洲过于庞大的税务律师和会计队伍。
	
What do Arabs Want?	阿拉伯人想要什么？
CAIRO – The self-immolation a year ago of Tunisian street vendor Mohammed Bouazizi triggered a wave of popular protests that spread across the Arab world, forcing out dictators in Egypt, Libya, and Yemen.	开罗 — — 一年前，突尼斯街头小贩穆罕默德•布瓦吉吉自杀引发了一系列深得人心的抗议活动，席卷了阿拉伯世界，迫使埃及、利比亚和也门的独裁者下台。
Now, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, too, seems near the end of his rule.	目前，叙利亚总统巴沙尔•阿萨德的统治似乎也接近尾声了。
Together, these movements for change have come to be known as the Arab Spring.	这些求变的运动统称为“阿拉伯之春 ” 。
But what values are driving these movements, and what kind of change do their adherents want?	但是什么价值观推动着这些运动，它们的追随者想要什么样的变革？
A series of surveys in the Arab world last summer highlights some significant shifts in public opinion.	去年夏天在阿拉伯世界开展的一系列调查凸显出了民意方面的一些重要变化。
In surveys, 84% of Egyptians and 66% of Lebanese regarded democracy and economic prosperity as the Arab Spring’s goal.	在调查中，84%的埃及人和66%的黎巴嫩人认为民主和经济繁荣是阿拉伯之春的目标。
In both countries, only about 9% believed that these movements aimed to establish an Islamic government.	在这两个国家，只有约9%的人认为这些运动旨在建立伊斯兰政府。
For Egypt, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia, where trend data are available, the Arab Spring reflected a significant shift in people’s values concerning national identity.	埃及、伊拉克和沙特阿拉伯有趋势数据，阿拉伯之春反映出人们在国家认同感的价值观方面发生了巨大转变。
In 2001, only 8% of Egyptians defined themselves as Egyptians above all, while 81% defined themselves as Muslims.	2001年，最重要的是，只有8%的人自认为是埃及人，81%的人自认为是穆斯林人。
In 2007, the results were roughly the same.	2007年，结果基本相同。
In the wake of the Arab Spring, however, these numbers changed dramatically: those defining themselves as Egyptians rose to 50%, 2% more than those who defined themselves as Muslims. Among Iraqis, primary self-identification in national terms jumped from 23% of respondents in 2004 to 57% in 2011.	然而，阿拉伯之春之后，这些数字发生了巨大的变化：自认为是埃及人的数量上升到了50 % ， 比自认为是穆斯林人的数量多2 % 。 在伊拉克人中，主要自认为是伊拉克人的数量占到了2004年回复者中的23 % ， 2011年飙升到了57 % 。
Among Saudis, the figure jumped from 17% in 2003 to 46% in 2011, while the share of those claiming a primary Muslim identity dropped from 75% to 44%.	在沙特阿拉伯人中，这一数据从2003年的17%蹿升至2011年的46 % ， 而主要自认为是穆斯林人的比重从75%下降到了44 % 。
There has also been a shift toward secular politics and weakening support for sharia (Islamic religious law).	还在向世俗政治转变，伊斯兰教法的支持率也越来越低。
Among Iraqis, the percentage of those who agreed that Iraq would be a better place if religion and politics were separated increased from 50% in 2004 to almost 70% in 2011.	在伊拉克人中，认为如果政教分离，伊拉克将更好的人的比例从2004年的50%上升到了2011年的近70 % 。
Similar data are not available for Egypt and Saudi Arabia, but both countries show a decline in support for sharia.	埃及和沙特阿拉伯没有类似的数据可以利用，但是在这两个国家，伊斯兰教法的支持率有所降低。
In Egypt, those considering it “very important” for government to implement sharia declined from 48% in 2001 to 28% in 2011.	在埃及，认为政府实行伊斯兰教法“非常重要”的人从2001年的48%下降到了2011年的28 % 。
For Saudis, the figure fell from 69% in 2003 to 31% in 2011.	在沙特阿拉伯人中，这一数据从2003年的69%下降到了2011年的31 % 。
Finally, an analysis of a nationally representative sample of 3,500 Egyptian adults, who rated their participation in the anti-Mubarak movement, showed that participants were more likely to be younger single males with higher socioeconomic status, users of the Internet, newspaper readers, urban residents, and believers in modern values and free will.	3500名埃及成年人（他们参加了反穆巴拉克运动）组成了具有全国代表性的样本。 最后，对这份样本的分析表明，参与者更有可能是社会经济地位较高的较年轻单身男性、互联网用户、新闻报纸的读者、城市居民以及现代价值观和自由意志的信奉者。
They did not mind having Americans, British, or French as neighbors.	他们不介意与美国人、英国人和法国人做邻居。
Religiosity did not predict participation, while religious intolerance reduced participation.	宗教狂热无法预测参与度，但是宗教的不宽容会降低参与度。
These figures seem at odds with the results of Egypt’s recent parliamentary election, in which the Muslim Brothers and the Salafi fundamentalists together gained about 65% of the popular vote.	这些数据似乎与埃及最近的议会选举结果矛盾，在这次议会选举中，穆斯林兄弟会和萨里发原教旨主义者共获得了约65%的大众选票。
It remains true that religion is an important factor for Egyptian voters, as 66% of those surveyed “strongly agree” or “agree” that it would be better if people with strong religious belief held public office; and 57% consider a government’s implementation of sharia “very important” or “important.”	对于埃及选民来说，宗教是一个至关重要的因素，这仍然是事实。 66%的受调查者“非常同意”或“同意 ” ， 如果具有强烈宗教信仰的人执政，该国将更美好；57%的人认为政府实行伊斯兰教法“非常重要”或“重要 ” 。
Nonetheless, nationalism trumps religion.	尽管如此，民族主义战胜了宗教。
Fully 78% agreed with the statement that it would be better if more people with a strong commitment to national interests rather than with strong religious views held public office.	整整78%的人认同如下看法：如果有更多坚定致力于国家利益而不是带有强烈宗教色彩看问题的人执政，该国家将更美好。
How, then, to explain the inconsistency between the survey data and Egypt’s election results?	那么，如何解释调查数据和埃及选举结果之间的不一致性呢？
First, the fundamentalists benefited from years of political organizing and activism, and thus were better able to mobilize their supporters, whereas the liberals, who led the uprising against the former regime, lacked nationwide organization and had little time to translate their newly acquired political capital into votes.	首先，原教旨主义者从多年的政治组织和活动中受益，因此能够更好地动员其支持者，而领导起义对抗前政权的自由主义者缺少全国性的组织，也没有什么时间将刚刚获得的政治资本转化成选票。
Second, the liberals’ priorities were misplaced.	其次，自由主义者的优先任务有问题。
Instead of pushing their agenda forward among Egyptians, they focused on the wrong enemy, spending invaluable time organizing rallies against the army.	他们没有在埃及人中推行其议程，而是把主要精力花在了错误敌人的身上，组织集会反对军队，白白浪费了时间。
Finally, the election outcome is not as bad as it appears.	最后，选举结果并没有其看上去那么糟糕。
Liberalism has been under continuous attack for decades from religious extremists and religious institutions, and liberal organizations were stifled by oppressive rules.	几十年来，自由主义受到宗教极端分子和宗教机构的不断攻击，自由组织也受到了压迫性法规的限制。
If the Mubarak regime had fallen under the banner of political Islam, Muslim fundamentalists would have been in a much better position to advance more exclusivist claims over the revolution and the country.	如果穆巴拉克政权在政治性伊斯兰教的旗帜下垮台，穆斯林原教旨主义者将处于更加有利的位置，对这次革命和国家获得控制权，更加地排外。
But it was the liberals who delivered Egypt from authoritarianism.	但是让埃及摆脱专制统治的是自由主义者。
This, in turn, brought legitimacy to liberalism and generated the powerful feeling of nationalist awareness among Egyptians.	这反过来给自由主义带来了合法性，唤醒了埃及人强烈的民族意识。
As a result, support for sharia declined and national identity soared.	因此，伊斯兰教法的支持率下降，国家认同感增强了。
Insofar as political discourse is focused on national rebuilding and freedom, Islamic fundamentalists, in Egypt and elsewhere, will face an uphill battle.	一定程度上，由于政治论调大多是国家重建和自由，埃及以及其他地方的伊斯兰原教旨主义者将面临一场艰难的战斗。
	
What do Egypt’s Generals Want?	埃及的将军想要什么？
CAIRO – “Whatever the majority in the People’s Assembly, they are very welcome, because they won’t have the ability to impose anything that the people don’t want.”	开罗 — — “无论哪个党派在议会获得了绝大多数，他们都是受人欢迎的，因为他们无法实施任何人民不愿意实施的措施 。 ”
Thus declared General Mukhtar al-Mulla, a member of Egypt’s ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF).	埃及最高军事委员会委员穆赫塔尔•阿尔•穆拉将军宣布道。
Al-Mulla’s message was that the Islamists’ victory in Egypt’s recent election gives them neither executive power nor control of the framing of a new constitution.	阿尔•穆拉的意思是，虽然伊斯兰主义者在埃及最近的选举中获胜，但是他们既不能获得行政权也无法控制新宪法的形成。
But General Sami Anan, Chief of Staff and the SCAF’s deputy head, quickly countered that al-Mulla’s statement does not necessarily represent the official views of the Council.	但是参谋长兼最高军事委员会副委员长萨米•阿南将军立即反驳说，阿尔•穆拉的观点并不代表该委员会的官方观点。
So, one year after the revolution that overthrew Hosni Mubarak, who, exactly, will set Egypt’s political direction?	革命推翻胡斯尼•穆巴拉克一年后，到底谁将确定埃及的政治方向？
The electoral victory of the Muslim Brotherhood’s political wing and the Salafi parties, which together won more than 70% of the parliamentary seats, will give them strong influence over the transitional period and in drafting the constitution.	穆斯林兄弟会的政治派和萨拉菲各派在选举中获胜，总共获得了议会中70%的席位，这将在过渡阶段给予他们强大的影响力并制定宪法。
But they are not alone.	但是并不是只有他们。
Aside from the Islamists, two other powerful actors will have their say: the “Tahrirists” and the generals.	除了伊斯兰主义者，还有两个强大的参与者有发言权：解放广场的抗议者和将军们。
Tahrir Square-based activism has not only brought about social and political change, but also has served as the ultimate tool of pro-democracy pressure on Egypt’s military rulers.	以解放广场为基地的活动不仅引发了社会和政治变革，最后还迫使埃及军方领导人支持民主。
Indeed, while the army, the most powerful of the three actors, still officially controls the country, there is little confidence in the generals’ commitment to democracy.	实际上，三个参与者中，军队最强大，还正式控制着这个国家，人们几乎不相信将军们会致力于民主。
“The SCAF are either anti-democratic….or some of their advisers told them that democracy is not in their best interest,” says Hazem Abd al-Azim, a nominee in the first post-Mubarak government.	“最高军事委员会不反对民主 … … 但是其中一些顾问告诉他们，民主并不是最符合他们利益的 。 ” 穆巴拉克政府倒台后首次选举的候选人哈齐姆•阿卜德•阿尔•阿齐姆说。
If the generals do not want democracy, nor do they want direct military rule à la Augusto Pinochet.	如果将军们不想要民主，他们也不想通过军队直接统治国家。
So, what do they want?	那么，他们想要什么？
Ideally, they would like to combine the Algerian army’s current power and the Turkish army’s legitimacy.	在理想的情况下，他们想融合阿尔及利亚军队当前的权力和土耳其军队的合法性。
This implies a parliament with limited powers, a weak presidency subordinate to the army, and constitutional prerogatives that legitimate the army’s intervention in politics.	这意味着议会的权力有限，软弱的总统受制于于军队，军队享有宪法的特权，能够干预政治事务。
The minimum that they insist on is reflected in statements by Generals al-Mulla, Mamdouh Shahim, Ismail Etman, and others. That would mean a veto in high politics, independence for the army’s budget and vast economic empire, legal immunity from prosecution on charges stemming from corruption or repression, and constitutional prerogatives to guarantee these arrangements.	阿尔•穆拉、马姆杜•沙希姆和伊斯梅尔•伊特曼等将军的声明反映了他们坚持的底线，即在重要政治问题上享有否决权、军队预算和大量的财政收入独立、享有腐败或镇压指控豁免权、享有宪法特权确保这些权益。
The new parliament and constitutional assembly will have to lead the negotiations with the SCAF.	新国会和宪法议会必须与最高军事委员会谈判。
But, given that any successful democratic transition must include meaningful civilian control over the armed forces and the security apparatus, the SCAF’s minimum demands could render the process meaningless.	但是鉴于任何成功的民主转型必须包括文官控制大部分军队和安全机构，最高军事委员会的最低要求可能会使这个过程毫无意义。
The veto in high politics would include any issues that touch on national security or sensitive foreign policy, most importantly the relationship with Israel.	在重要问题上享有否决权意味着在涉及国家安全或敏感外交政策（最重要的是与以色列的关系）等问题时都享有否决权。
With an Islamist majority in the parliament promising to “revise” the peace agreement with Israel, tensions over foreign policy are likely to rise.	伊斯兰主义者在国会中占大多数预示着要“重新修订”与以色列的和平协议，这样外交政策上的紧张关系很可能出现。
The independent military-commercial empire, which benefits from preferential customs and exchange rates, no taxation, land-confiscation rights, and an army of almost-free laborers (conscripted soldiers), is another thorny issue.	独立的军事商业帝国又是一个棘手的难题。 它从优惠的关税和汇率、免税、土地没收权和大批几乎免费的劳动力（入伍的士兵）中受益匪浅。
With the Egyptian economy suffering, elected politicians might seek to improve conditions by moving against the military’s civilian assets – namely, by revising the preferential rates and imposing a form of taxation.	由于埃及的经济萎靡不振，当选的政客可能会试图通过应付军队的民用资产 — — 具体点说就是修订优惠税率并采用新税收形式 — — 来改善经济状况。
Immunity from prosecution is no less salient.	免受指控也很引人注目。
“The Field-Marshal should be in jail now,” screamed the elected leftist MP, Abu Ezz al-Hariri, on the second day of the new parliamentary session.	当选的左翼议员阿布•伊兹•阿尔•哈里利在新国会选举的第二天喊道 ： “ 陆军元帅现在应该关在监狱了 。 ”
When Mahmoud Ghozlan, the Muslim Brotherhood spokesperson, proposed immunity (known in Egypt as the “safe-exit” option), he faced a wave of harsh criticism.	当穆斯林兄弟会的发言人马哈茂德•戈兹朗提议豁免权（在埃及称为“安全脱身”的选择）时，他受到��严厉的批评。
Pressure from the United States has also influenced the SCAF’s decision-making.	美国的压力也影响了最高军事委员会的决策。 “埃及军方接受了美国13亿美元的资助 … … 他们很重视美国的要求 。 ”
“The military establishment receives $1.3 billion from the US….They are very sensitive to US requests,” according to Saad Eddin Ibrahim, who lobbied the Obama administration to support the revolution in January 2011.	萨德•埃丁•易卜拉欣说。 2011年1月，他曾游说奥巴马政府支持革命。
But most of the SCAF’s pro-democracy decisions have come as a result of massive pressure from Tahrir Square.	但是最高军事委员会大多数支持民主的决定都是解放广场抗议者大力施压的结果。
This includes the removal of Mubarak, his trial (and that of other regime figures), and bringing forward the presidential election from 2013 to June 2012.	其中包括推翻穆巴拉克政府、庭审穆巴拉克（以及其他穆巴拉克政府的官员）和将总统大选从2013年提前到2012年6月。
Two other factors are equally, if not more, influential: the status quo inherited from the Mubarak era and the army’s internal cohesion.	如果不是更加具有影响力的话，另外两个因素至少具有相同的影响力：从穆巴拉克时代继承下来的现状和军队内部的凝聚力。
With few exceptions, the SCAF’s members benefited significantly from Mubarak’s regime.	几乎没有什么特例，最高军事委员会的委员都从穆巴拉克政府中受益匪浅。
They will attempt to preserve as much of it as possible.	他们将竭尽全力保住尽可能多的利益。
“The sight of officers in uniform protesting in Tahrir Square and speaking on Al Jazeera really worries the Field Marshal,” a former officer told me.	“在解放广场抗议并在阿拉伯半岛新闻电视台讲话的军人实际上是担心陆军统帅 ， ” 一位前官员对我说。
And one way to maintain internal cohesion is to create “demons” – a lesson learned from the “dirty wars” in Algeria in the 1990’s and Argentina in the 1970’s and 1980’s.	保持内部凝聚力的一种方法是创造“恶魔 ” — —这是从二十世纪九十年代阿尔及利亚和二十世纪七八十年代阿根廷的“肮脏战争”中学来的。
In particular, Coptic protesters are an easy target against which to rally soldiers and officers.	科普特的抗议者特别容易成为士兵和军官整治的目标。
Last October, amid an unnecessary escalation of sectarian violence, state-owned television featured a hospitalized Egyptian soldier screaming, “The Copts killed my colleague!”	去年10月份，在不必要的宗派暴力升级过程中，国有电视特别报道一位住院的埃及士兵喊道 ， “ 科普特人杀了我的同事 ！ ”
The systematic demonization of the Tahririst groups, and the violent escalation that followed in November and December, served the same purpose.	有系统地妖魔化解放广场上的抗议者以及11月和12月的暴力升级都是为了达到相同的目的。
Despite everything, democratic Egypt is not a romantic fantasy.	尽管如此，埃及实现民主并不是不切实际的。
A year ago, Saad al-Ketatni, the Muslim Brotherhood leader, would never have dreamed of being Speaker of Parliament.	一年前，穆斯林兄弟会的领袖萨德•阿尔•卡塔尼根本不会想到自己会当上国会的发言人。
The same applies to the leftists and liberals who now hold around 20% of the parliament’s seats.	左翼人士和自由人士也不会想到，他们现在竟然占到了国会大约20%的席位。
If 2011 witnessed the miracle of Mubarak’s removal, a brave parliament’s institutional assertiveness, coupled with non-institutional Tahririst pressure, could force the generals to accept a transfer of power to civilian rule (with some reserved domains for the army establishment) in 2012. What is certain is that this year will not witness a return to the conditions of 2010.	如果2011年见证了穆巴拉克下台的奇迹，2012年将见证勇敢的国会机制力量和解放广场抗议者压力的非机制力量迫使将军们接受向文官统治转变（军方在一些领域将保有权力 ） 。
Egypt may become stuck in democratization’s slow lane, but there will be no U-turn.	埃及可能在民主的慢车道上前行，但是不会倒退。
The hundreds of thousands who marched to Tahrir Square on the revolution’s anniversary will guarantee that.	成千上万的人到解放广场游行纪念革命一周年将保证这种趋势。
	
What Do Muslim Women Want?	穆斯林女性究竟要什么？
NEW YORK – When caricature takes the place of dialogue, everyone suffers – especially when it comes to understanding issues affecting women, who struggle worldwide against being silenced.	发自纽约 — — 当鹦鹉学舌取代了沟通对话，所有人都深受其害 — — 尤其是当话题关乎如何理解全世界反抗压制的女性之时。
Some right-wing American bloggers recently twisted an article that I wrote in a way that did just that.	但就在最近，一些美国右翼博客写手却曲解了我的一篇有关女性的文章，所用伎俩恰如我在文章开头写的那样。
I wrote that many women activists in Muslim countries tend to emphasize issues such as honor killings, legal inequality, and lack of access to education, and that they express frustration that the obsession among Westerners with Muslim women’s clothing can come at the expense of these concerns.	我在那篇文章中写到，许多穆斯林国家的女性活动家希望将一些诸如“荣誉谋杀 ” 、 法律不平等和缺乏受教育机会的问题重点展现给世人，但她们同时也对西方人总把对穆斯林女性穿着的迷思凌驾于这些问题之上感到困惑不满。
I also pointed out that many Muslim feminists defend their dress in terms of nationalism, anti-imperialism, or as a matter of faith.	我还指出，许多穆斯林女权主义者维护她们的穿着方式，目的是捍卫她们的民族主义，反帝国主义理念，或者就是一个信仰问题。
This provoked a small firestorm of distortion in the West: “Wolf Wants to Institutionalize the Burka,” etc.	但上述呼声却在西方掀起了一股歪曲我本意、所谓“沃尔夫想将布卡（穆斯林女性传统服装）合理化”的风暴。
It was depressing to see a simple appeal for Westerners to listen to Muslim women deliberately distorted into a representation of all Muslim women as meek, will-less beings in need of rescue.	而令人沮丧的是：我仅仅是在呼吁西方人倾听穆斯林女性的心声，却被故意歪曲成某种象征，似乎所有穆斯林女性都是些急待拯救的，驯服而缺乏意志的小动物。
I was so sure that Muslim women should be allowed to speak for themselves because of the faces of Muslim feminism I encountered in recent travels – notably in Jordan, a country fascinatingly poised between tradition and innovation, developing under a forward-looking monarchy that is seeking to modernize and, to an extent, democratize. For those Westerners who worry about Islamic fundamentalism in the Arab world, surely Jordan is a worthy model to understand, support, and engage.	而我之所以对穆斯林女性应拥有为自己说话的权利如此肯定，是缘自于我在最近旅行中遇到的几位穆斯林女权主义者 — — 尤其是在约旦这个在传统与创新中取得完美平衡，并在高瞻远瞩的君主政体领导下走向现代化以及在某种程度上的民主化的国度。 对于那些担忧阿拉伯世界原教旨主义的西方人来说，约旦无疑是一个值得我们理解、支持和加强交往的典型。
The women leaders I met in Amman were not saying, “Please tell the West to save us.” They were too busy making egalitarian, modernist new worlds of their own, with an Arab, and often Islamic, imprimatur.	我在约旦首都阿曼遇到的那些女领导人并没有跟我说 ， “ 请转告西方世界快来拯救我们 ” ， 因为她们正忙于缔造属于自己的平等和现代主义新世界，并获得了阿拉伯世界甚至时常来自伊斯兰教的认可。
Princess Rym Ali, sister-in-law of Queen Rania – the Chanel-wearing media star who is rebranding a more contemporary Jordan – is one vivid example; Princess Rym is making immense progress in a more behind-the-scenes way.	约旦王后拉尼娅是一位身着香奈尔时装的媒体宠儿，并且正致力将约旦重塑成为一个更加现代化的崭新国家。 而其妯娌丽姆·阿里王妃则更是一位生动的典范；作为王妃，她本人喜欢在幕后做出自己的巨大贡献。
She met me in a leafy Amman suburb, in the palace that she shares with Prince Ali and their small children.	她与我在阿曼郊外一处树木葱郁的宫殿会面，这是她和阿里王子以及年幼的孩子们共同生活的地方。
A former CNN journalist, her quiet bearing and diplomatic manner belie her courage: she captured her husband’s heart as she was reporting from Baghdad on the eve of “shock and awe,” standing firm before the cameras even as the bombs were falling.	作为一名前CNN记者，丽姆王妃娴静的举止和出色的外交辞令掩盖了她的过人勇气：在美军对伊拉克发动“震撼与威慑”行动前夕，在巴格达的丽姆即便在炸弹乱飞之时依然牢牢站在摄像机面前进行现场报道，并以此俘虏了阿里王子的心。
Princess Rym and Prince Ali have supported a new film institute, the Red Sea Institute of Cinematic Arts, a joint production with the University of Southern California that is bringing together bright young people from all over the Middle East to learn contemporary filmmaking, apprentice with international film productions, and get the region’s stories out.	最近在丽姆王妃与阿里王子的支持下，约旦与南加州大学合作创建了红海电影艺术学院。 学院聚集了来自整个中东的青年才俊，师从国际电影出版公司学习制作现代电影制作，并讲述中东自己的故事。
Though she can no longer practice journalism directly, Princess Rym is also co-founding new Jordanian journalism school. Her aim is to replace journalists’ acceptance of the “party line” – even if the party is her own extended family – with a more critical perspective.	而尽管王妃本人已经不能继续从事新闻事业，她仍然参与合作创建了新的约旦记者学校 — — 目的是让记者们不再做“党派路线”的跟风者 — — 即使这个政党就是她王室家庭的延伸 — — 并具备批判性的判断力。
She directed my attention to Jordanian-made films about the subordination of women inside the home, and to Rana Husseini’s powerful book on honor killings, Murder in the Name of Honor .	她把我的注意力引向多部约旦制作，讲述妇女家庭从属地位的电影，以及一本有关“荣誉谋杀”的大作 — — 由拉娜·胡赛因撰写的《谋杀：以荣誉的名义 》 。
But her implicit message was that these critical examinations of women’s inequality in the Arab world are most enlightening when they are created by women’s advocates from within that culture, rather than sensationalized or superficial versions of the problem created in the West.	而她的言下之意则是，这些对于阿拉伯世界里女性不平等现象的严厉拷问，来自阿拉伯文化内部妇女的呼声要比耸人听闻或肤浅无比的“西方制造”版本更加发人深省。
Mary Nazzal, owner, with her family, of a chic and bustling boutique hotel, is another dynamo who looks as if she stepped out of a fashion shoot.	还有一位就是玛丽·纳扎尔，作为一座时髦而受欢迎的精品酒店的家族所有人，她也是一位精力充沛，仿佛刚从时尚大片中走出来的女性。
But it would be a mistake to underestimate her seriousness. I call her “Martha Stewart meets Che Guevara,” because, when not renovating the elegant public spaces of her hotel, she is suing Israeli generals for war crimes that she claims were committed against civilians in Gaza.	但不能因此低估她的严肃认真态度：我把纳扎尔称为“玛莎·史都华+切·格瓦拉”式的女性，因为当纳��尔不在酒店里修整那些优雅的公共空间时，她正在国际刑事法院当庭控告以色列将军们对加沙平民所犯下的战争罪行。
Nazzal was trained as a British barrister, and chairs the board of the Human Rights Legal Aid Fund.	纳扎尔接受过英国高级律师的教育，并且是“人权法律援助信托基金”的董事会主席。
Her organization is intent on using international law to hold accountable members of the Israeli military who put civilians in harm’s way during the invasion of Gaza – events that the recent Goldstone Report confirms.	该组织的宗旨就是用国际法制裁那些在入侵加沙行动中对平民伤害事件负有责任的以色列军方成员，而这些暴行都是得到联合国调查小组发布的《戈德斯通报道》确认的。
She is passionate about the Palestinian cause, mixing her cutting-edge legal advocacy with a willingness to listen to decent people from all sides of the conflict, and a fierce attachment to peace in the region based on due process and justice.	纳扎尔对于巴勒斯坦的案例非常积极，她把自己顶尖的法律辩护能力与听取冲突各方正直人士意见的意愿糅合在一起，并热切相信遵循法律程序和公正的审判将能够在地区内建立和平。
Finally there is Rana Husseini herself – a role model for investigative reporters everywhere who began documenting and investigating honor killings in her newspaper, The Jordan Times .	最后一位女性则是拉娜·胡赛因本人 — — 世界各地调查记者的模范典型。 拉娜在她供职的《约旦时报》中首先记录并调查“荣誉谋杀”的问题。
Honor killings claim an estimated 5,000 women every year, and are increasingly common in immigrant communities abroad.	据她估计，每年约有5000名女性被“荣誉谋杀”夺去生命，同时在海外移民社区里的死亡人数也有所增加。
According to her account, a woman can be killed for “laughing at a joke in the street, wearing makeup or a short skirt…or being raped by a brother.”	按照拉娜的解释，一个女人因类似“在大街上被逗笑，化妆，身着短裙 ” ， 或者“被某个兄弟强奸”的理由就能被置于死地！
After she began her series of reports, Husseini received death threats at her office almost daily – as well as hundreds of letters of support from readers.	自从拉娜展开一系列报道后，她的办公室几乎每天都收到死亡威胁，但同时也收到了成千上百封读者的支持信。
As a result of her brave investigations, which included interviews in prisons, many Muslim countries are revising their criminal codes, and the issue has taken center stage internationally.	作为她勇敢调查的回报（这些调查甚至包括对狱中女性的采访 ） ， 许多穆斯林国家正在修订刑法，而这个话题也成为国际关注的中心。
These women are exactly the kind of leaders that everyone should be cultivating and supporting, rather than overlooking because of a belief that they cannot exist in the Middle East.	这些女性正是我们每个人都应该加以培养和支持的领袖人士，而不是用“中东根本不存在这样的女性”的谬论来忽略她们。
We would do better to find out more about them than to waste our time on superficial debates about how they – and many others who are just as accomplished – should dress.	这样我们才能更好的了解她们，而不是把时间都浪费在聒噪地争论这些女性，以及千千万万个同她们一样卓有成就的穆斯林女性应该如何穿着上。
	
What Euro Crisis?	什么是欧元危机？
FRANKFURT – What constitutes a crisis?	法兰克福 — — 危机的构成要素是什么？
Is it sustained economic decline, high and long-term unemployment, poverty, rampant inflation, a precipitous fall in the exchange rate, fiscal deficits, high borrowing costs, and political dysfunction?	是经济的持续衰退、长期的高失业率、贫困、恶性通货膨胀、汇率的急剧下降、财政赤字、借贷成本高、还是政治问题？
Most would agree that a crisis exists if just some of these “misery indices” are present.	大部分人都认为，如果此类“痛苦指数”中的某些问题出现，就会引发危机。
But, while Europe is widely perceived to be in the grip of crisis, only a handful of them are present, and in only a few eurozone countries.	然而，虽然普遍认为欧洲正面临危机，但欧洲只是存在少数几个问题，而且此危机只存在于几个欧元区国家。
So, why is there a eurozone crisis, and what defines it?	那么，欧元区为什么会出现经济危机呢？
Time and again, it is argued that the single currency does not fit the different needs of its member countries, and that unsustainable economic divergence will ultimately require that the euro be abandoned.	该危机又是如何界定的呢？ 人们屡次争辩称，单一货币不符合各成员国迥然各异的需求，而且非持续性经济分歧最终将要求欧元区放弃欧元。
The fatal divergences that are most frequently cited include differences in growth rates, job-creation, and unemployment rates, as well as dramatic disparities in current-account balances, all of which may be traceable to wide deviations in unit labor costs.	最常提到的致命分歧包括增长率、创造就业、失业率之间的差异以及经常账户余额之间的巨大差距，所有这一切都可能会追溯到单元劳动成本之间的巨大差异。
Perceptions of such divergences force considerable risk premiums on problem countries, inevitably resulting in accelerating capital flight to safe havens.	此分歧给问题国家带来相当大的风险溢价问题，这不可避免地会加快资本向安全地区外逃的速度。
All of these developments are now visible in the eurozone, particularly in its peripheral countries.	在欧元区 — — 尤其是欧元区的边缘国家 — — 存在所有的这些问题。
Risk premiums started rising above benign levels in 2009, and then more strongly in 2011-2012, while capital flight became rampant in 2011.	2009年，风险溢价开始上升到高于良性水平的高度，在2011-2012年上升地更为剧烈；同时，在2011年资本外逃的问题也十分严重。
But, if one considers what might underlie capital movements of this sort, suspicion must also fall on unsustainable policies that extend to countries well outside the eurozone.	但是，若要考虑这种资本流动的基础是什么的话，人们可能会猜疑是非持续性政策延伸到了欧元区以外的国家。
In the wider European Union, countries like the United Kingdom or Hungary are as much afflicted by structural deficiencies as some peripheral eurozone countries are.	在范围更广的欧洲联盟，如英国和匈牙利等国同某些欧元区边缘国家一样都深受结构性缺陷的影响。
Exchange-rate flexibility has not helped them much, or at least they have chosen not to exploit it.	而灵活的汇率并没有起到多大的作用，或者至少它们都没有启动灵活的货币政策。
Moreover, there are countries with government-debt burdens that are as large, if not larger, than those on Europe’s periphery – the United States and Japan being prime examples.	此外，有些国家的政府债务负担同欧洲边缘国家的债务负担一样大，甚至更大，美国和日本就是两个最好的例子。
Other countries, like Norway and Switzerland, are running current-account surpluses that exceed 10% of their GDP, but are resisting currency revaluation.	而挪威和瑞士等其他国家的经常账户余额已超过本国GDP的10 % ， 但这些国家却拒不对货币进行增值。
It is worth remembering that, for the decade until 2005, Germany was labeled the “sick man of Europe.”	值得记住的是，2005年之前的10年，德国被称为是“欧洲病夫 ” 。
Germany was uncompetitive when it entered the eurozone, owing to excessive wage and price increases following the country’s reunification – a problem that has since been overcome by structural reforms that the country undertook within the single currency.	德国重新统一后，工资和物价过度增长，因此在加入欧元区时德国并无竞争力，但是德国在单一货币区内进行了结构改革，而此问题也得以解决。
The same is true for the most recent eurozone member, Estonia, whose rigorous wage restraint ensured competitiveness in the single market in a short period of time.	最近加入欧元区的成员国爱沙尼亚也面临相同的状况，该国严格的工资限制保证其短期内在这个单一市场上拥有一定的竞争力。
Why, then, is there such strong doubt that the euro can survive?	那么，人们为什么如此强烈地质疑欧元能否继续延用下去呢？
Some say that the current efforts to enforce sound policies in the peripheral countries are bound to fail, and that sacrificing democracy in these countries to keep the monetary union intact is too high a price to pay.	有些人指出，当前旨在促进边缘国家政策实施的措施注定要失败，而且以牺牲这些国家的民主来换取货币联盟的完整要付出的代价过大。
In fact, the efforts of governments and international institutions point the way toward more sustainable solutions.	事实上，各国政府和国际组织试图寻找更持久的解决办法。
Who would have believed at this time last year that the fiscal pact adopted in March would have been possible?	去年的这个时候谁会相信3月份通过的财政协议在此时会成为可能呢？
And, despite fluctuations, has there not been a considerable reduction in risk premiums for problem countries, without adding to the financing costs of donor countries?	此外，在不给捐助国增加财务费用的情况下，问题国家是否可以大幅减少风险溢价呢（尽管会存在波动 ） ？
Much remains unknown.	目前尚存在众多未知因素。
Are we seeing tentative signs of escape from the eurozone’s malaise?	当前欧元区的困境有解决办法吗？
Will debtor countries be able to stick to tough reform programs, or will their citizens reject austerity?	债务国会实行严格的改革方案吗，其公民会拒绝紧缩的经济政策吗？
And will donor countries avoid the sort of populist backlash at home that might push them in a protectionist direction?	若捐助国的民粹主义者在国内发起强烈的抵制，可能会迫使该国实行贸易保护主义，那么捐助国会避免这一情况的发生吗？
Intelligent cooperation that avoids moral hazard should be able to prevent panic, reduce risk premiums, and permit fuller use of resources.	智能合作可以避免道德风险，智能合作应该能够防止恐慌情绪、减少风险溢价、并能使资源得到更充分的利用。
For example, transnational migration flows should certainly be made easier and more attractive.	例如，跨国移民应更容易，更有吸引力。
High levels of unemployment, particularly among young skilled workers, could be avoided if donor countries that need migrants to invigorate their own workforces were able to attract them.	目前失业率 — — 尤其是年轻技术工人的失业率 — — 非常高。 若需要借助移民来激活本国劳动力的捐助国无法吸引移民，该国则无法避免失业率高的困境。
More immigration would strengthen skills and raise income levels, while reducing distressed countries’ expenditure on unemployment benefits.	移民的增加会提高受困国家的技能水平和收入水平，同时也会减少该国在失业津贴上的开支。
Greater labor mobility within the EU would also help to create a more open European mindset, and thus weaken old nationalist prejudices.	若欧盟的劳动力流动性增大，也将使欧洲的思维更加开放，从而削弱旧民族主义的偏见。
So, will Europe commit to moving toward political union, and thereby address what has remained missing, despite the single market, the euro, and the Schengen Agreement’s elimination of internal borders?	因此，欧洲是否会建立一个政治联盟，以此解决当前存在的问题呢？ — — 尽管欧洲现在是单一市场，采用的是欧元并制定了消除内部边界的《申根协定 》 。
The model for a future United States of Europe is Switzerland, a country with four languages and ethnicities, fiscally strong sub-national units (cantons), a single first-rate currency, and a federal government and a parliament that exercises genuine, if limited, fiscal authority.	瑞士是未来欧洲合共国的模型。 在瑞士有四种语言和种族，下属有多个亚国家单位（州 ） ， 而且各亚国家单元的财政力量都十分强大，整个瑞士使用的是一流的单一货币，由联邦政府和议会行使真正的（若有限）财政权利。
If the EU made the most of the competencies that it already has, and governed more effectively, the Union as a whole could achieve faster economic growth for at least the next decade, with a 2.5% annual rate not out of reach.	如果欧盟能完全发挥现有的能力，并能更有效地进行管理，那么未来的至少十年整个联盟的经济就会得到更快的发展，2.5%的年增长率也将不再遥不可及。
More generous support for countries in trouble is essential, because the euro must be preserved (albeit not necessarily on the base of a larger eurozone).	为处于困境的国家提供更慷慨的援助是必不可少的重要事项，这是因为必须要保留欧元（虽然这未必是以庞大的欧元区为基础 ） 。
Financial markets would be more easily convinced if such support were complemented by the recipient countries’ acceptance of the fiscal pact, together with technical help to strengthen their governance.	如果受援国就该援助签署财政协议，而且援助国在提供援助时也提供技术支持以增强其统治能力，那么金融市场将更易被折服。
In Greece, anti-corruption officers from the US, Italian tax-efficiency specialists, German privatization experts, and Spanish tourism professionals should be made available to accelerate the pace of modernization.	希腊应任用来自美国的反腐人员、意大利研究税收效率的专家、德国研究私有化的专家以及西班牙的旅游专家来加快现代化的步伐。
All of this amounts to a much-needed and often-advocated Marshall Plan for the periphery.	所有这一切相当于边缘国家所急需并大力提倡的马歇尔计划。
But it recognizes that what Europe’s troubled countries need most is not money, but the planning and administrative capacity to spend it effectively.	但是，其认识到深陷困境的欧洲国家最急需的并非金钱，而是如何有效利用资金的规划和管理能力。
Over the last decade, Greece could absorb only a fifth of the EU modernization funds available to it.	过去的10年，希腊有效吸收的欧盟现代化资金只有5 % ， 但当时希腊未必定要如此。
It didn’t have to be that way then, and Europe cannot afford to let it remain that way now.	而现在欧洲已无力让其保持这样的状态。
	
What The EU Must Do Now	欧盟必须采取举措
WASHINGTON, DC – The United Kingdom’s Brexit vote is arguably the greatest disaster ever to hit the European Union.	华盛顿 — — 英国的退欧投票可以说是有史以来欧盟面临的最大灾难。
Now, the EU must act fast – not least by ending the post-referendum market turmoil – if it is to survive.	现在欧盟要想生存就必须迅速采取措施 — — 而且目的不仅是结束公投后的市场动荡。
British Prime Minister David Cameron, having lost the referendum, did the obvious thing by resigning.	英国首相戴维·卡梅伦在公投失利后，通过辞职承担了责任。
But the other loser is the European Commission, whose president, Jean-Claude Juncker, did little to change the outcome of the Brexit vote.	但还有一个输家是欧洲委员会，主席让 - 克洛德·容克几乎没有付出什么努力来改变英国退欧投票的结果。
Not since Jacques Delors was President of the Commission, from 1985 to 1995, has that position been filled by a leader with any vision or political clout.	从1985到1995年雅克·德洛尔任委员会主席以来，再也没有有远见或政治影响力的领袖担任过委员会主席职务。
Juncker, like Cameron, should accept responsibility and resign.	像卡梅伦一样，容克应当承担责任并辞去职务。
The EU needs a strong leader again.	欧盟再次需要一位强有力的领导者。
There are many worthy candidates, but I recommend former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt.	其实有很多不错的人选，但我个人推荐瑞典前首相卡尔·比尔特。
Before the post-referendum dust settles, the EU should set an ultimatum with clear and onerous principles for the UK’s exit – clarity to minimize the cost, and severity to deter populists in other member states from calling for exit referenda, too.	在后公投期的尘埃落定之前，欧盟应当为英国退出制定原则明确且严厉的最后通牒 — — 明确是为了尽可能降低成本，严厉是为遏制其他成员国的民粹主义者呼吁进行退欧公投。
Sensibly, European Commission leaders have already moved in this direction by voiding concessions made by the EU to the UK back in February and declaring that there “will be no renegotiation.”	显然，欧洲委员会领袖已经在这方面采取了举措， 宣布今年2月对英国做出的让步无效，并公开宣称“不会再有重新谈判的机会 ” 。
The European Council, for its part, has already called for an immediate summit.	欧洲理事会已经呼吁立即召开峰会。
Having failed for six years to resolve the Greek financial crisis, the EU finally appears to understand that its very survival depends on swift and decisive action.	在6年未能解决希腊金融危机后，欧盟似乎终于明白其自身的生存依赖于能否迅速果断采取行动。
But the EU must go further than just Brexit damage control.	但欧盟的任务不仅局限在英国退欧的损害控制。
For the last four decades, Europe’s fundamental problem has been complacency in the face of low economic growth caused by excessive taxation and regulation.	过去40年来，欧洲的根本问题是面对税收及监管过度所引发的经济增长放缓还洋洋自得。
Europe can no longer afford this standstill.	欧洲已经无法忍受这样的停滞。
It must now begin to carry out fundamental reforms: cut unjustified social benefits; liberalize services, labor markets, and digital markets; reduce labor taxes; deregulate industry; improve education; and promote research and development.	现在必须进行根本性的改革：削减不合理的社会福利；服务、劳动力和数字市场自由化；降低劳动税负；解除行业管制；改善教育；并推动研究和开发。
Current EU rules are clear on the responsibilities of EU institutions and national governments, respectively.	目前的欧盟规则明确了欧盟机构和各国政府的责任。
The problem is that most European governments (especially British Tory governments) tend to scapegoat the EU to mask their own political myopia.	问题在于多数欧洲政府（特别是英国保守党政府）倾向于把欧盟当作替罪羊来掩盖其自身政治远见的缺乏。
Little wonder that the EU has grown so unpopular.	欧盟如此不受欢迎因此就不值得大惊小怪了。
Given that it already receives the blame, the European Commission should now be granted the power to act politically.	鉴于欧盟已经承担了责任，现在应当授予欧盟委员会政治行动权。
The EU has a strong case to make for itself, but it needs good-faith leaders to deliver its message to the people.	欧盟有能力在公众面前证明自己，但需要诚实的领导人将消息传递给各国民众。
European populists point to the mishandling of migration issues to justify their cause.	欧洲民粹主义分子用移民问题处理不当来证明他们的观点。
So, for starters, the EU should establish an orderly migration policy with quotas and criteria, as Australia and Canada have successfully done, and impose proper control over its external borders.	因此，首先，欧盟应当像澳大利亚和加拿大那样制定以配额和标准为基础的有序的移民政策，并适当控制其外部边境线。
The EU border control agency, Frontex, needs a stronger mandate and more resources to fulfill this crucial role.	欧盟边境控制机构Frontex需要更有力的授权和更多资源才能完成这项至关重要的任务。
Going further, the EU should institute a joint foreign and defense policy to address the underlying causes of the migration crisis – namely, the conflicts in Libya and Syria.	进一步讲，欧盟需要实行共同的外交和防卫政策，以解决移民危机的根本原因 — — 也就是利比亚和叙利亚发生的冲突。
For a quarter-century, Europe has benefited from the post-Cold War peace dividend and irresponsibly allowed member states’ average defense expenditure to slip to a paltry 1.4% of GDP.	四分之一世纪以来，欧盟得益于后冷战期的和平红利，不负责任地允许成员国将平均国防开支降低到微不足道的GDP的1.4 % 。
This should be increased to at least the 2% of GDP each NATO member has promised.	国防开支应至少增加到所有北约成员国承诺的GDP的2 % 。
Today, only five EU countries have defense expenditures at that level.	今天，只有5个欧盟国家的国防开支达到了承诺的要求。
With good reason, US President Barack Obama has called Europeans “free riders.”	美国总统巴拉克·奥巴马称欧洲人“搭便车”理由非常充分。
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, going much further, openly questions both NATO and US military expenditures abroad.	共和党总统候选人唐纳德·特朗普更进一步，公开质疑北约和美国的海外军事开支。
In the near future, Europe may no longer be able to rely on the US to defend it and should prepare for a scenario in which it is forced to fend for itself.	在不久的将来，欧洲可能无法再依赖美国为其提供防御，并应当做好准备防御其自身。
The principle of representative democracy is at the heart of European identity; ironically, only EU non-member Switzerland has a strong tradition of referenda.	代议制民主原则是欧洲共同身份的核心；但讽刺的是，只有非欧盟成员国的瑞士拥有公民投票的优良传统。
One of the positive consequences of the squalid Brexit campaign is that it demonstrated that referenda and plebiscites are demagogic, not truly democratic.	卑劣的英国退欧活动产生的积极效���之一是向全世界表明全民公决和公民投票富于煽动性，绝不是真正的民主。
EU members should recognize the risks of so-called direct democracy and tighten the criteria for the passage of referenda.	欧盟成员国应认识到所谓直接民主的巨大风险并收紧全民公决通过的标准。
At a minimum, referenda should be required to achieve a supermajority with a high percentage of voter turnout.	最低限度，全民公决应要求在高投票率的情况下达到绝对多数。
The best one can say about Brexit is that it finally may have put an end to European complacency.	英国退欧的最乐观结果可能是最终结束了欧洲的洋洋自得。
We will know for sure only if, and when, Europe chooses to save itself.	只有当欧洲选择自我拯救我们才能知道确切的结果。
	
Whatever Happened to Wage Insurance?	工资保险怎么了？
A lot of public attention and worry nowadays surrounds the new risks that globalization and information technology create for our wages and livelihoods.	目前，对全球化和信息技术给我们的工资和生计带来的种种新风险，公众倾注了大量的注意力，忧虑重重。
But there has been far less constructive discussion of new ideas about how to confront these risks.	但对与如何应对这些风险相关的新想法的建设性讨论，却要少得多。
In fact, we might be losing the momentum we had a few years ago to implement some of these ideas.	事实上，我们正在逐渐失去将这些想法付诸实施的动力，而这些动力，几年前我们还有。
To be sure, we still sympathize with people who, upon reaching middle age or later, find themselves replaced by lower-paid workers in another part of the world, if not by a computer or a robot.	有些人在步入中年或此后，会发现自己已被世界上其它地方更为廉价的劳动力替代（如果不是被电脑或机器人替代的话 ） ， 对这些人，我们仍然抱有同情，这点毫无疑问。
But are we really going to do anything about these risks?	但是，我们真打算为这些风险采取什么行动吗？
One new idea that seemed hot a few years ago is “wage insurance.”	数年前似乎热门一时的一个新想法便是“工资保险 ” 。
As then floated, the idea was simple: the government would protect people from the risk of losing their job and being unable to find a new one at the same wage.	如当时所流传的一样，这个想法非常简单：政府保护人民免遭失业且不能找到同样工资水平的新工作的风险。
A government insurance program would pay these people a fraction, say, half, the difference between their old pay and their pay in a new job for a specified period, such as two years.	政府保险计划将在某一特定时间内（如两年）支付给这些人旧有工资和新工作工资的部分差额，比如说一半。
The idea was first proposed by Robert Z. Lawrence and Robert Litan in their 1986 book, Saving Free Trade, andrevived in a 2001 article by Litan and Lori Kletzer.	罗伯特· Z· 劳伦斯（ Robert Z. Lawrence）和罗伯特·利坦（Robert Litan）在其 1986 年出版的《拯救自由贸易》一书中，首次提出了这一想法，利坦和洛丽•克莱策（Lori Kletzer） 在 2001 年联合发表的一篇文章中对此重新提及。
The proposal generated interest.	该提议引起了人们的兴趣。
A demonstration program was adopted in the United States in 2002.	2002 年，美国采纳了一个示范计划。
In 2002, the Hartz Commission recommended a version of it in Germany.	同年，哈尔茨委员会（Hartz Commission）在德国推荐使用其德国版。
Wage insurance programs have been actively talked about or actually implemented in some form in Britain, France, Switzerland, and Ireland.	在英国、法国、瑞士、爱尔兰，工资保险计划都为人们所津津乐道，或以某种形式付诸实际实施。
Despite all the intellectual applause, however, wage insurance programs are still not a significant force in the world economy.	尽管所有的知识分子都对此表示欢迎，但是，在世界经济中，工资保险计划仍然不是什么重要力量。
They should be. But they should also be supplemented by other devices.	虽然本应所此，但还是应该用其它工具来对其加以补充。
One advantage of wage insurance is that it may be a more effective way to subsidize on-the-job training than traditional government-run vocational training programs.	与传统的政府推行的职业培训计划相比，工资保险不失为在职培训更为有效的补助方式，这是工资保险的一大优势。
Often, after completing a government-sponsored program, participants find it impossible to secure a job with the promised higher pay.	计划参与者在完成了政府发起的计划后，往往发现自己不可能找到培训计划所承诺的，报酬较高的工作。
Far better, proponents of wage insurance argue, for the training to be carried out by an employer who wants a job done and knows what the employee needs to learn.	工资保险的倡议者辩论说，培训如果由想让员工完成某一工作的雇主来进行，情况会好得多，因为雇主了解到底员工需要学习什么。
It seems plausible that two years is long enough for retraining, after which the employee might command a higher wage without a government subsidy.	两年时间，对再培训来说也够长了。 两年以后，员工可能不需要政府补贴便能拿到更高的工资，这似乎也合情合理。
But governments, fearing the expense of wage insurance if a lot of people exploit it, have not been willing to implement it on a large scale.	但是，政府担心如果很多人利用工资保险，其费用会非常高，所以不愿意大规模实施此计划。
For example, the US wage insurance program is confined to manufacturing workers over age 50 who are in competitively vulnerable industries and are deemed by the Secretary of Labor to have nontransferable skills.	比如，美国工资保险计划就仅限于 50 岁以上，所在行业竞争力极为低下的制造工人，这些人被劳工部视为不具备可转移技能。
Moreover, the benefit is capped at $5,000 per year.	此外，该福利的上限是每年 5,000 美元。
The program has practically been forgotten, and will expire next year unless it is renewed.	该计划事实上已经被人遗忘，而且除非到时更新，否则明年就要到期了。
With government deficits the norm, that appears unlikely.	而政府赤字已成定则，所以更新看起来可能性很小。
The way to regain lost momentum is to recognize that wage insurance is only one of several new ideas for insuring the emerging risks of this century.	要重获失去的动力，就得承认工资保险不过是本世纪为新出现的风险提供保险的数个新想法之一。
The weakness of the current wage insurance proposal is that it pays benefits only for a limited period and relies for its long-term effect on the retraining incentives that it creates.	当前的工资保险提议的弱点在于：该保险仅为一段有限的时间支付福利，并且依赖于对自己创造的再培训动力的长期效果。
In reality, however, losing a high-paying job may be a lifetime event, and the supposed retraining that wage insurance would encourage for a laid-off 50-year-old worker often may be ineffective.	但是事实上，丢掉高收入工作可能是一辈子的事情，而对一个被裁掉的 50 岁工人而言，工资保险计划所鼓励的再培训往往没有什么效果。
In my 2003 book, New Financial Order: Risk in the 21st Century, I proposed a different idea, which I called “livelihood insurance.”	我在自己 2003 年出版的《金融新秩序：管理 21 世纪的风险》一书中，提出了另外一个不同的想法，我称之为“生计保险 ” 。
As the name implies, livelihood insurance is designed to provide more than just a brief respite or a subsidy for retraining. It is aimed at dealing with long-term changes in the labor market, rather than assuring temporary wage levels.	如其名字所示，设计生计保险不仅仅是为了提供一个短暂的暂缓之计，也不只是为再培训提供补助，而是为了应对劳动力市场的长期变化���而非确保暂时的工资水平。
It would also rely on the market rather than a government program.	生计保险还应该依赖市场，而非政府计划。
With livelihood insurance, a private insurer would pay a stream of income to a policyholder if an index of average income in the insured person’s occupation and region declines substantially.	根据生计保险计划，如果被保险人所在职业和地区的平均收入指数大幅度下降，那么私有保险人就将持续向保单持有人支付收入流。
Moreover, this income stream would continue for as long as the index stays down, not just for a couple of years (or any other arbitrary period).	此外，指数的低水平持续多久，该收入流就该持续多久，而不仅仅是几年（或其它规定的时间期限 ） 。
In other words, this insurance policy would protect against lifetime income risks.	换言之，本保单可为一辈子的收入风险提供保护。
One reason why government-run wage insurance programs must have limited duration is that they involve so-called “moral hazard”: the risk that people will get lazy or would take easier, lower-paying jobs and continue to collect insurance that pays them the wage of a more demanding occupation.	政府经营的工资保险计划为什么一定要有时间限制，原因之一是这些计划涉及所谓的“道德危险 ” ， 即人们可能变懒的风险，或人们可能选择从事较为简单的，收入较低的工作，同时继续获取保险收入的风险（保险将支付给他们要求更高的职业所支付的工资 ） 。
But this would not apply to livelihood insurance, because its benefits are tied to the rise and fall of income indices, which are beyond the control of individuals.	这种情况不适用于生计保险，因为生计保险与收入指数的升降紧密相关，而这，不在个人的控制范围之内。
Livelihood insurance would also have another advantage.	生计保险还有另外一大优势。
Since the premium would be determined by the market, it would be higher in occupations that the market believes to be in danger from outsourcing or technical change.	由于保险费由市场来决定，所以市场认为外包或技术变革将给其带来危险的职业，保险费就相应要高。
This, in turn, would give workers a tangible warning and an incentive to anticipate job losses before they occur.	这反过来会给工人以实在的警告与刺激，让其在失业发生之前，便预见到其可能性。
This is not to say that wage insurance is a bad idea, or that it should not be implemented on a wider scale.	这并不是说工资保险就不好，也不是说工资保险不应该大规模实施。
Both wage and livelihood insurance appear to have important risk management functions.	无论是工资保险，还是生计保险，都具有重要的风险管理功能。
Indeed, for the future, it is imperative to think about many new ways, involving both government and the market, to ensure that we manage better the greatest personal risks now faced by workers around the world.	事实上，为了未来着想，我们必须要多想一些新办法出来，这些办法既要把政府包含在内，也要把市场包含在内，这样才能保证我们能更好地管理目前全世界工人所面对的最大的个人风险。
	
The Dollar’s Doldrums	美元的忧郁
BERKELEY – Donald Trump’s first year as US president has been, if nothing else, a bounteous source of surprises.	伯克利—如果说特朗普当美国总统的第一年有什么特点的话，那就是充满了惊奇。
One of the big ones in the circles I frequent is dollar weakness.	我时常“混迹其中”的圈子之一的一大惊奇是美元的弱势。
Between January 2017 and January 2018, the broad effective exchange rate of the dollar fell by 8%, wrong-footing many of the pundits.	从2017年1月到2018年1月，美元广义有效汇率下跌8 % ， 让很多专家大跌眼镜。
I include myself among the wrong-footed (others can decide whether I qualify as a pundit).	我把自己也包括在大跌眼镜的行列（至于我算不算专家，由你决定 ） 。
Tax cuts and interest-rate normalization, I expected, would shift the mix toward looser fiscal and tighter monetary policies, the combination that drove up the dollar in the Reagan-Volcker years.	我预计，减税和利率正常化将让政策组合向宽财政、紧货币变化，而这一组合在里根-沃尔克时代曾推高美元汇率。
Tax changes encouraging US corporations to repatriate their profits would unleash a wave of capital inflows, pushing up the dollar still further.	鼓励美国公司汇回海外利润的税制变化将释放一波资本流入，进一步推高美元。
New tariffs that made imports more costly and that shifted demand toward domestic goods would require offsetting effects in a near-full-employment economy in order to shift demand back to foreign sources.	让进口品变得更加昂贵的新关税将促使需求向本国产品倾斜，在接近充分就业的经济状态，这需要抵消效应以使需求重新偏向外国。
The most plausible such offset was, of course, appreciation of the real exchange rate, which could occur only through inflation or, more plausibly, a stronger dollar.	当然，最合理的抵消效应便来自真实汇率升值，而这只能通过通货膨胀或（也更合理）强势美元实现。
The markets, in their wisdom, rejected this logic for more than a year.	一年多来，市场智慧拒绝接受这一逻辑。
It is thus incumbent upon those who of us made such predictions to “mark our views to market,” as my Berkeley colleague Brad DeLong likes to say.	因此，我们这些做出这样的预测的人 — — 用我的伯克利同事德隆（Brad DeLong）常说的话说，必须“按市场情况决定观点 ” 。
Economic commentators are better at rationalizing past exchange-rate movements than at forecasting future trends.	经济评论员更擅长解释过去的汇率变动，而非预测未来趋势。
So, when it comes to explanations for the dollar’s decline over the past year, we are confronted by an embarrassment of riches.	因此，对于解释美元在过去一年中的贬值，我们面临着富人的“打脸 ” 。
The most popular explanation for dollar weakness is that Trump, through incompetence or misdirection, failed to deliver what he promised.	对弱势美元的最流行的解释是特朗普的无能和方向性错误导致其没有兑现他的承诺。
There was no across-the-board import tariff.	他没有实行全面的进口关税。
There was no abrogation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.	他没有取消北美自由贸易协定。
There was no $1 trillion infrastructure package.	他也没有实施1万亿美元基建计划。
But there were, in fact, deep tax cuts.	但深度减税真的存在。
There were, in fact, interest-rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.	美联储真的生息了。
And there were, in fact, tax changes creating incentives for the repatriation of profits.	税收变化真的产生了汇回海外利润的激励。
Other things equal, these developments should have propped up the dollar.	在其他条件保持不变的情况下，这些变化应该推高美元。
So there must be more to its weakening than just Trump’s failure to deliver.	因此除了特朗普没有兑现承诺之外，肯定还有其他因素令美元疲软。
Another popular explanation is that investors expected the real exchange rate to rise through inflation rather than currency appreciation.	另一个流行的解释是投资者预期真实汇率将通过通胀而非货币升值实现上涨。
The dollar weakened, in this view, because the Fed fell behind the curve and risked losing control of the inflation process.	根据这一看法，美元贬值是因为美联储落后于市场，有可能失去对通胀过程的控制。
Conceivably, this interpretation could prove correct.	这一解释很有可能令人信服地被证明是正确的。
But it is not correct yet.	但现在它还不对。
There was no surge in inflation between January 2017 and January 2018.	2017年1月—2018年1月没有发生通胀激增。
Currently, the fear in the markets is not that the Fed is behind the inflation curve but that it will raise interest rates even faster than expected in order to preempt overheating.	目前，市场的担忧不在于美联储落后于通胀曲线，而在于为了先发制人控制过热，它会比预期更快地升息。
And if higher interest rates are good for one thing, they’re good for the dollar.	而如果说利率的升高对什么有利的话，那就是对美元有利。
Beyond this, there are at least 17 other narratives to explain dollar weakness.	除此之外，还有至少17种其他叙事解释美元的弱势。
Some are insightful. Others are entertaining.	其中一些很有洞见，一些纯属娱乐。
Most, however, overlook the most plausible explanation, which is Trump-related uncertainty.	但大部分人都忽略了最合理的解释，那就是与特朗普有关的不确定性。
Investors have no way to forecast the impact of policies, because policies thought to be headed one way suddenly veer in the opposite direction.	投资者无从预测政策的影响，因为理应朝一个方向发展的政策突然朝相反的方向发展。
A big infrastructure bill turns out to be small.	巨大的基建支出最后变得很小。
Withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement turns into a possible decision to re-enter TPP.	退出跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（TPP）最后演变为有可能重新加入TPP。
Steve Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, seemingly abandons the United States’ strong-dollar policy but then re-embraces it.	财政部长努钦（Steve Mnuchin）好像已经放弃了美国的强势美元立场，但随后又重新回到这一立场。
Uncertainty is the order of the day, every day.	不确定性成为特朗普执政的日常。
And there’s nothing investors like less than uncertainty.	而投资者最不喜欢的莫过于不确定性。
This is especially true of investors in a currency whose strongest attraction is its safe-haven status.	特别是以安全港地位为最强吸引力的货币的投资者。
Investors traditionally flock to the dollar not simply because it is stable, but also because it tends to strengthen in a crisis, given that its issuer has impregnable defenses and possesses the deepest and most liquid financial markets in the world.	传统上，投资者对美元趋之若鹜不仅仅是因为它稳定，也是因为它会在危机期间升值，而这又是因为美元的发行人拥有牢不可破的防卫力量并拥有全世界深度最深、流动性最大的金融市场。
But now that issuer also has a president who is casting doubt on his country’s defense alliances and who is, consciously or not, encouraging his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, to build, or at least boast of, new offensive weaponry.	但如今，这个发行人的总统怀疑它的防务盟国，同时有意无意地鼓励其俄罗斯同侪普京发展或至少自吹自擂新进攻性武器。
It has a president who has encouraged the idea of a government shutdown, fueling doubts about the liquidity of the market in US Treasury bonds.	这个发行人的总统鼓励政府关门的思维，激发人们对美国国债市场流动性的怀疑。
More chaos in the White House would only depress the dollar further.	白宫的日益混乱只能进一步抑制美元。
Working in the other direction is the fact that some of the dollar-supportive measures that observers expected Trump to adopt, such as tariffs on steel imports, are now coming, like it or not.	另一方面，观察者们预期特朗普所实施的一些对美元起支持作用的措施，如钢铁进口关税，正在成为现实，不管你喜不喜欢。
It may be indicative that on March 1, when Trump announced his steel and aluminum tariffs and the stock market tanked, the dollar strengthened.	3月1日特朗普宣布征收钢铁和铝关税，股市处于低迷，而美元走强，这具有指标意义。
Uncertainty may continue to dominate, but it may also be that the dollar’s rise on March 1 was a harbinger of what is to come on foreign-exchange markets.	不确定性可能仍会唱主角，但3月1日的美元上涨也许是外汇市场未来走势的预兆。
	
France’s German Mirror	德国映照出的法国镜像
BERLIN – Berlin’s Tegel Airport, which still greets most of the passengers arriving in the capital of Europe’s leading economic power, is outdated and provincial.	柏林 — — 虽然柏林的泰格尔机场依然迎候着飞抵这个欧洲经济大国的多数旅客，但相关的设施却早已落后而破旧不堪。
The opening of Schönefeld Airport, transformed into an international hub, has been delayed for more than a year for technical reasons (a somewhat reassuring challenge to Germany’s reputation for efficiency).	完成向国际枢纽转型的舍内费尔德机场由于技术原因而推迟开放超过一年（这对德国以效率著称的声望构成了某种挑战 ） 。
Yet, despite the gray and chill of March in Central Europe, Berlin exudes confidence.	虽然早春三月的中欧阴沉而寒冷，但柏林仍然散发出自信的气息。
More than ever, the city is a work in progress – confused, not very beautiful, and overcharged with history.	此外，虽然在历史的重压下迷茫而并不美轮美奂，但柏林仍处在发展之中。
Berlin is a construction site that has managed to transform its multiple pasts into positive energy.	柏林是一个将多重过去成功转化为正能量的大工地。
“Diversity destroyed: Berlin 1933-1938” is the unifying theme of a series of exhibits marking the 80th anniversary of Hitler’s coming to power and the 75th of the Pogromnacht. At the Deutsches Historisches Museum on Unter den Linden, entire classes of young pupils and students flock to see the exhibit’s evocation of destruction by a criminal regime whose objects, from loudspeakers to uniforms and weapons, are displayed in an educational manner.	“柏林1933-1938：多样性的毁灭”是希特勒执政80周年暨水晶之夜75周年系列纪念展的统一主题。 在菩提树下大街的德国历史博物馆，整班的年轻学生蜂拥而来参观犯罪政权所展现的破坏力：从高音喇叭、制服到武器，犯罪政权曾经的历史罪证现在被用于教育目的。
Young Berliners cannot ignore where they come from.	年轻的柏林人不能忘记过去。
Yet, perhaps because the past still rings like a warning – and is still physically visible in the topography and architecture of the city today – Berlin is striking in its simplicity, its radiant modernity (symbolized by the glass dome of the Reichstag, a conception of the British architect Norman Foster), and, above all, its intensity.	但或许因为过去仍然警钟长鸣（而且在今天的城市建筑地貌中仍然依稀可辨 ） ， 柏林城的简单 、 （ 以英国建筑师诺曼·福斯特设计的国会大厦玻璃穹顶为代表的）容光焕发的现代感还有激情都令人忍不住赞叹。
That positive energy contrasts starkly with the decadent beauty of Paris, a city that is on a path of “museification.”	这种正能量与巴黎的颓废美形成了鲜明的对比，后者的一切正日趋“博物馆化 ” 。
Of course, if you can afford to live there, Paris remains a great place to be.	当然，巴黎在能负担得起开销的人眼中仍是好地方。
But Berlin is a better place to work, even if what you do is very poorly paid.	而柏林却是一片工作胜地，即使你的报酬很低。
The porter who brings my luggage to my hotel room is of Tunisian origin. He is a happy Berliner and a proud new German.	将行李送到我酒店房间的勤杂工来自突尼斯，他是个快乐的柏林人、骄傲的德国新移民。
And, even on a low salary, he can live and raise his children in the city itself.	并且即使薪酬很低，他也可以在柏林城里生活和抚养儿女。
Thanks to its moderate housing costs, Berlin has not become, like Paris, a ghetto for the rich.	适度的住房成本使柏林避免了像巴黎一样沦为有钱人的聚居地。
Unlike the French, who are handicapped by the high cost of housing, Germans’ purchasing power is more harmoniously distributed, creating more room for household consumption to contribute to economic growth.	与受困于高房价的法国人相比，德国人的购买力分配更加和谐，为家庭消费贡献于经济增长创造了条件。
Germany’s positive energy is, of course, the result of success translated into confidence, which Chancellor Angela Merkel incarnates with strength and simplicity.	德国的正能量无疑是成就转化为信心的结果，这一点在安格拉·默克尔总理身上得到简洁有力的体现。
Merkel has changed profoundly while in office.	默克尔在任职期间发生了深刻的改变。
Five years ago, she did not exude the natural authority that she now possesses.	五年前，她还不像现在这样散发出自然而然的权威感。
Today, like Pope Francis, she is clearly at ease with herself.	今天，她像弗朗西斯教皇一样达到了精神上的和谐。
Has there been a French president since François Mitterrand who was truly a match for a German chancellor?	弗朗索瓦·密特朗之后有哪任法国总统可以和德国总理相比？
If France has replaced Germany as “the sick man of Europe,” it is for political reasons, above all: vision, courage, and strength on the northern side of the Rhine, and vacillation, inertia, and weakness on the southern.	如果法国取代了德国“欧洲病夫”的位置，归根结底恐怕主要出于政治原因：莱茵河北岸展现的是远见、勇气和力量，而南岸却暴露出动摇、惯性和弱点。
Of course, given its excessively low salaries and adverse demographic trends, Germany will continue to face difficulties.	当然，鉴于工资过低且人口趋势不利，德国仍将继续遭遇困难。
But to emphasize only these problems, as some French do, is pure escapism.	但像某些法国人那样片面强调问题却纯粹是逃避现实的表现。
German demography cannot be described as the solution to French youth unemployment, as though one could rest on a slogan such as: “They lack young people, our young people lack jobs – what a perfect match!”	德国的人口问题不能作为法国年轻人失业的借口，就像一幅标语所说 ： “ 他们缺年轻人，我们的年轻人缺工作 — — 真是绝配 ！ ”
This widespread sentiment irresponsibly assumes that time is working in favor of France, regardless of whether it implements structural reforms.	这样的普遍情绪不负责任地假设无论是否进行结构改革，时间都会对法国有利。
France’s current direction is a source of deep concern in Germany, whose evolution should be seen in France as a source of inspiration – an example to be emulated, even if the country must not fall into self-flagellation.	即使不必过于自责，法国也应该仿效德国的榜样。 法国目前的走向在德国备受关注，而法国人应当从德国人走过的道路中汲取教训。
Yet today’s debate in France over the German model reminds one eerily of the discussions that followed France’s defeat in the Franco-Prussian War.	但今天法国对德国模式的讨论诡异地令人想起普法战争惨败后的情景。
In June 1871, just after the war ended, the French statesman Léon Gambetta declaimed: “Our adversaries have won, because they rallied to their side foresight, discipline, and science.”	1871年6月，​​战争刚刚结束，法国政治家列昂·甘贝塔就慷慨陈词 ： “ 我们的敌人赢了，因为他们拥有远见、纪律和科学 。 ”
Germany, it seems, can still rally those eternal values.	德国似乎仍能凝聚上述价值观。
The major difference now is that the European unification process rules out war – even economic war – between the two countries.	当前的主要差别是欧洲统一进程排除了两国交战、甚至是经济战的可能性。
On the contrary, in the mirror of Germany, the French must ask themselves fundamental questions.	相反，在德国这面镜子面前，法国人必须在根本问题上扪心自问。
Have they made the right choices in terms of leaders and policies in recent decades?	几十年来他们选择的领导人和政策究竟对不对？
The places of power in France do not encourage modesty.	法国的权力场不鼓励谦虚。
In his latest book, Days of Power, the former agriculture minister, Bruno Le Maire, writes condescendingly of the building that houses his Danish counterpart in Copenhagen, which he compares to low-income housing.	前农业部长布鲁诺·勒梅尔在其新著《任职的日子》中不屑地描述其丹麦同行在哥本哈根的住所，并将其比喻成低收入住房。
With too much pomp, too many stumbling blocks, and a dearth of dynamism, France today can and should learn from Germany.	今天的法国太讲排场、有太多掣肘、却鲜有活力，真应该学习德国的榜样。
	
What Greece Needs to Prosper	希腊繁荣需要什么
NEW YORK – Some economists overlook the modern idea that a country’s prosperity depends on innovation and entrepreneurship.	纽约—一些经济学家忽视了一个现代观点，即，一国的繁荣取决于创新和企业家精神。
They take the mechanistic view that prosperity is a matter of employment, and that employment is determined by “demand” – government spending, household consumption, and investment demand.	他们机械地认为，繁荣事关就业，而就业决定于“需求 ” — —政府支出、家庭消费和投资需求。
Looking at Greece, these economists argue that a shift in fiscal policy to “austerity” – a smaller public sector – has brought an acute deficiency of demand and thus a depression.	在希腊问题上，这些经济学家认为，财政政策转向“紧缩 ” — —即缩小公共部门 — — 导致了需求急剧萎缩，从而发生萧条。
But this claim misreads history and exaggerates the power of government spending.	但这一观点误解了历史，也夸大了政府支出的力量。
Much of the decline in employment in Greece occurred prior to the sharp cuts in spending between 2012 and 2014 – owing, no doubt, to sinking confidence in the government.	希腊就业率下降中有很大一部分发生在2012—2014年支出大幅缩减之前，毫无疑问，这是拜政府信心下降所赐。
Greek government spending per quarter climbed to a plateau of around €13.5 billion ($14.8 billion) in 2009-2012, before falling to roughly €9.6 billion in 2014-2015.	2009—2012年希腊政府每季度支出攀升至135亿欧元左右的高峰，然后在2014—2015年下降至96亿美元左右。
Yet the number of job holders reached its high of 4.5 million in 2006-2009, and had fallen to 3.6 million by 2012.	但有工作者人数在2006—2009年期间达到高峰（450万 ） ， 到2012年已下降至360万。
By the time Greece began to cut its budget, the rate of unemployment – 9.6% of the labor force in 2009 – had already risen almost to its recent level of 25.5%.	当希腊开始缩减预算时，其失业率 — — 占2009年劳动力比例为9.6 % — —几乎已经上升到当前水平（25.5 % ） 。
These findings weigh heavily against the hypothesis that “austerity” has brought Greece to its present plight.	这些事实极大地打击了“紧缩”导致希腊当前困境的假说。
They indicate that Greece’s turn away from the high spending of 2008-2013 is not to blame for today’s mass unemployment.	它们表明，希腊2008—2013年间支出由盛转衰并非今天大面积失业的原因。
Another finding casts doubt on whether austerity actually was imposed on Greece.	另一个发现质疑希腊实际上到底有没有实施紧缩。
Government spending has certainly fallen – but only to where it used to be: €9.6 billion in the first quarter of this year is, in fact, higher than it was as recently as 2003.	政府支出显然是下降了 — — 但只是下降到从前的正常水平：今年首季度政府支出为96亿欧元，事实上比2003年还要高。
So the premise of austerity appears to be wrong.	因此，紧缩这一前提似乎是错误的。
Greece has not departed from past fiscal norms; it has returned to them.	希腊并没有远离过去的财政范式；只是回到从前而已。
Rather than describing current government spending as “austere,” it would be more correct to view it as an end to years of fiscal profligacy, culminating in 2013, when the government’s budget deficit reached 12.3% of GDP and public debt climbed to 175% of GDP.	也许不应该将当前政府支出称为“严苛 ” ， 更准确的说法是结束了多年的财政挥霍（以2013年为定点，当时政府预算赤字达到了GDP的12.3 % ， 公债攀升至GDP的175 % ） 。
The “demand school” might respond that, regardless of whether there is fiscal austerity now, increased government spending (financed, of course, by debt) would impart a permanent boost to employment.	“需求学派”也许会说，不管现在有没有财政紧缩，政府支出增加（当然，资金来自债务）将给就业带来永久提振。
But Greece’s recent experience suggests otherwise.	但希腊最近的经验表明并非如此。
The huge rise in government spending from 2006 to the 2009-2013 period did produce employment gains, but they were not sustained.	从2006年到2009—2013年期间，政府支出大幅增加，确实带来了就业增加，但并未得到持续。
The real sticking point is that the government would have to issue bonds to finance its extra spending.	真正的症结在于政府必须发行债券为增加的支出融资。
Assuming a limit to foreign investors’ willingness to buy these bonds, Greeks would have to buy them.	假设外国投资者购买这些债券的兴趣有限，则剩下的必须由希腊人购买。
In an economy unequipped for growth, household wealth relative to wages would soar, and the labor supply would shrink, causing employment to contract.	在一个增长无力的经济中，家庭财富相对工资将出现飙升，而劳动力供给将下降，导致就业萎缩。
So spending more is not the remedy for Greece’s plight, just as spending less was not the cause.	因此，增加支出并不是解决希腊困境的妙方，正如减少支出并非其根源。
What is the remedy, then?	那么，药方现在在哪里呢？
No amount of debt restructuring, even debt forgiveness, will suffice to achieve prosperity (in the form of low unemployment and high job satisfaction).	债务重组乃至债务豁免都不足以实现繁荣（以低失业和高职业满意度衡量 ） 。
Such measures would only help Greece to revive government spending.	这些措施只能帮助希腊重新增加政府支出。
Then the economy’s stultifying corporatism – clientelism and cronyism in the public sector and vested interests and entrenched elites in the private sector – would gain a new lease on life.	然后，希腊经济中思维迟钝的社团主义 — — 公共部门的官官相护和任人唯亲以及私人部门根深蒂固的精英 — — 将获得新的喘息机会。
The European left may advocate that, but it would hardly be in Europe’s interest.	欧洲左派也许支持这一点，但这绝不符合欧洲的利益。
The remedy must lie in adopting the right structural reforms.	药方必须在于实施正确的结构改革。
Whether or not the reforms sought by the eurozone members raise the chances that their loans will be repaid, these creditors have a political and economic interest in the monetary union’s survival and development.	不论欧元区成员国所寻求的改革是否能提高其贷款得到偿还的机会，货币联盟的生存和发展符合这些债权人的利益。
They should also be ready to help Greece with the costs of making the necessary changes.	它们还应该准备好帮助希腊承担做出必要改变的成本。
But it is Greece itself that must take charge of its reforms.	但希腊的改革必须由希腊自己做主。
And there are encouraging signs that Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is willing to take up that cause.	令人鼓舞的信号表明，希腊总理齐普拉斯愿意担任这方面的领导。
But he will need a sense of the required reforms.	但他需要采取必要改革的责任感。
Greece must dismantle corporatist arrangements and practices that obstruct whatever innovation and entrepreneurship might emerge.	希腊必须打破阻碍创新家和有活力的企业家出现的社团主义安排和行为。
Nurturing an abundance of imaginative innovators and vibrant entrepreneurs requires embracing a vision of venturesome lives of creativity and discovery.	培养大量有想象力的创新家和有活力的企业家需要有创造力和发现的冒险精神。
	
What Happened to India?	印度发生了什么？
CHICAGO – Emerging markets around the world – Brazil, China, India, and Russia, to name the largest – are slowing.	芝加哥—全球各新兴市场国家 — — 以巴西、中国、印度和俄罗斯为首 — — 正在减速。
One reason is that they continue to be dependent, directly or indirectly, on exports to advanced industrial countries.	原因之一是它们仍直接或间接地依赖于向工业化国家的出口。
Slow growth there, especially in Europe, is economically depressing.	工业化国家的增长减速，特别是欧洲，具有抑制经济的作用。
But a second reason is that they each have important weaknesses, which they have not overcome in good times.	但第二个原因是它们各自有着重大弱点，并且没能在繁荣期克服这些弱点。
For China, it is excessive reliance on fixed-asset investment for growth.	中国的问题是过度依赖固定资产投资带动增长。
In Brazil, low savings and various institutional impediments keep interest rates high and investment low, while the educational system does not serve significant parts of the population well.	在巴西，低储蓄和各种制度性障碍导致利率高企、投资不足，教育制度也无法给相当多的人口提供良好教育。
And Russia, despite a very well educated population, continues to be reliant on commodity industries for economic growth.	俄罗斯尽管拥有教育程度较高的人口，但仍然需要依赖商品维持经济增长。
Hardest to understand, though, is why India is underperforming so much relative to its potential.	不过，最难以理解的事情是印度的表现为何会大大低于其潜力。
Indeed, annual GDP growth has fallen by five percentage points since 2010.	事实上，2010年以来，印度年GDP增长率降低了5个百分点。
For a country as poor as India, growth should be what Americans call a “no-brainer.”	像印度这样的穷国，增长应该是很容易的事情，用美国人的话说 ， “ 闭着眼睛”都能增长。
It is largely a matter of providing public goods: basic infrastructure like roads, bridges, ports, and power, as well as access to education and basic health care.	只消提供公共品就行了：基本基础设施（公路、桥梁、港口和电力）以及教育和基本卫生服务。
And, unlike many equally poor countries, India already has a very strong entrepreneurial class, a reasonably large and well-educated middle class, and a number of world-class corporations that can be enlisted in the effort to provide these public goods.	与其他差不多穷的国家不同，印度已经拥有了强大的创业家阶层、规模足够大且教育程度高者的中产阶级以及众多可以动员起来提供公共品的世界级企业。
Satisfying the demand for such goods is itself a source of growth.	满足公共品需求本身就是增长的动力之一。
But, also, a reliable road creates tremendous additional activity, as trade increases between connected areas, and myriad businesses, restaurants, and hotels spring up along the way.	非但如此，一条可靠的公路可以引来大量额外经济活动，如彼此通路区域之间的贸易增长和各种沿路开办的企业、餐厅和饭店。
As India did away with the stultifying License Raj in the 1990’s, successive governments understood the imperative of economic growth, so much so that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) contested the 2004 election on a pro-development platform, encapsulated in the slogan, “India Shining.”	随着20世纪90年代取消无用的许可证制度，印度各届政府十分理解经济增长的重要性，2004年大选时，印度人民党（BJP）便以促发展为平台，提出了“让印度放光芒”的口号。
But the BJP-led coalition lost that election.	但BJP领导的联盟在大选中失利。
Whether the debacle reflected the BJP’s unfortunate choice of coalition partners or its emphasis on growth when too many Indians had not benefited from it, the lesson for politicians was that growth did not provide electoral rewards.	不管人民党的失败是因为选错了合作伙伴，还是因为在太多印度人没有从中获益时过早地强调发展，政客们得到的教训都是一样的 — — 增长带不来选举胜利。
In any event, that election suggested a need to spread the benefits of growth to rural areas and the poor.	无论如何，那次大选表明，需要把增长得好处带给农村地区和穷人。
There are two ways of going about that.	办法有两个。
The first, which is harder and takes time, is to increase income-generating capabilities in rural areas, and among the poor, by improving access to education, health care, finance, water, and power.	第一个办法比较费时费力：通过普及教育、卫生、金融、和水电增强农村地区和穷人的收入能力。
The second is to increase voters’ spending power through populist subsidies and transfers, which typically tend to be directed toward the politically influential rather than the truly needy.	第二个办法是通过民粹主义补贴和转移支付增加选民的消费力，但补贴和转移通常会流向影响力较大而不是真正需要的地方和人群。
In the years after the BJP’s loss, with a few notable exceptions, India’s political class decided that traditional populism was a surer route to re-election.	BJP失败后的几年中，除了少数显著例外，印度政客们认为传统民粹主义对连任更有利。
This perception also accorded well with the median (typically poor) voter’s low expectation of government in India – seeing it as a source of sporadic handouts rather than of reliable public services.	这种感觉也与中位选民（通常属于穷人阶级）对印度政府期望较低一致 — — 他们认为，印度政府只会零星地做一些施舍，成不了可靠的公共服务提供者。
For a few years, the momentum created by previous reforms, together with strong global growth, carried India forward.	几年来，先期改革所造成的势头以及强劲的全球经济增长给印度带来了进步。
Politicians saw little need to vote for further reforms, especially those that would upset powerful vested interests.	政客们认为不再需要为进一步改革费心了，特别是那些可能让手握重权的既得利益集团不满的改革。
The lurch toward populism was strengthened when the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance concluded that a rural employment-guarantee scheme and a populist farm-loan waiver aided its victory in the 2009 election.	国大党领导的团结进步联盟（United Progressive Alliance）认为，农村就业保障机制和民粹主义农场贷款豁免是其2009年大选获胜原因之一，这强化了印度的民粹主义倾向。
But, while politicians spent the growth dividend on poorly targeted giveaways such as subsidized petrol and cooking gas, the need for further reform only increased.	但是，尽管政客将增长红利以定向馈赠 — — 比如油价和燃气价格补贴 — — 的方式花在了穷人身上，进一步改革的需求却在不断增强。
For example, industrialization requires a transparent system for acquiring land from farmers and tribal people, which in turn presupposes much better land-ownership records than India has.	比如，工业化要求建设运输系统，建设运输系统要求从农民和部落民手中征地，而征地有要求印度目前不具备的完善土地所有权记录。
As demand for land and land prices increased, corruption became rampant, with some politicians, industrialists, and bureaucrats using the lack of transparency in land ownership and zoning to misappropriate assets.	随着土地需求和土地价格升高，腐败逐渐横行，某些政客、企业家和官僚利用土地所有权的不透明中饱私囊。
India’s corrupt elites had moved from controlling licenses to cornering newly valuable resources like land.	腐败的印度精英阶层不再控制许可证，而转向了控制土地等新兴宝贵资源。
The Resource Raj rose from the ashes of the License Raj.	许可证制度已经寿终正寝，资源统治方兴未艾。
India’s citizenry eventually reacted.	印度人民最终觉醒了。
An eclectic mix of idealistic and opportunistic politicians and NGOs mobilized people against land acquisitions.	理想主义政客、机会主义政客和非政府组织形成了一个折中主义群体，动员人们反对土地兼并。
With investigative journalists getting into the act, land acquisition became a political land mine.	随着调查记者的加入其中，土地兼并成了一颗政治地雷。
Moreover, key institutions, such as the Comptroller and Auditor General and the judiciary, staffed by an increasingly angry middle class, also launched investigations.	此外，不少以愤怒的中产阶级为成员主题的重要机构，比如国家审计署（Comptroller and Auditor General）和司法部，也开始了调查。
As evidence emerged of widespread corruption in contracts and resource allocation, ministers, bureaucrats, and high-level corporate officers were arrested, and some have spent long periods in jail.	随着关于合约和资源分配腐败横行的证据浮出水面，政府部长、官僚和企业高管纷纷被捕，一些人被判处长期徒刑。
The collateral effect, however, is that even honest officials are now too frightened to help corporations to navigate India’s maze of bureaucracy.	但是，这样做也有副作用 — — 诚实的官员噤若寒蝉，不再敢引导企业与印度迷宫般的官僚机构打交道。
As a result, industrial, mining, and infrastructure projects have ground to a halt.	结果，工业、矿产和基础设施工程陷入了停滞。
Populist government spending and the inability of the supply side of the economy to keep pace has, in turn, led to elevated inflation, while Indian households, worried that no asset looks safe, have taken to investing in gold.	民粹主义政府支出以及经济的供给端无法跟上需求反过来导致了通胀高企，而印度家庭找不到安全资产，只能投资于黄金。
Because India does not produce much gold itself, these purchases have contributed to an abnormally wide current-account deficit.	由于印度本身黄金产量不高，家庭对黄金的高需求就转变为异常高的经常项目赤字。
Not much more was required to dampen foreign investors’ enthusiasm for the India story, with the rupee falling significantly in recent weeks.	光是这条便已足以打消外国投资者对印度的热情，因此，最近几周卢比出现了狂跌。
As with the other major emerging markets, India’s fate is in its own hands.	与其他主要新兴市场国家一样，印度的命运掌握在自己手中。
Hard times tend to concentrate minds.	艰难时世有利于人心齐。
If its politicians can take a few steps to show that they can overcome narrow partisan interests to establish the more transparent and efficient government that a middle-income country needs, they could quickly re-energize India’s enormous engines of potential growth.	如果印度政客可以迈出几小步，证明他们能够克服狭隘门户之见，建立中等收入国家所需要的更透明、更高效的政府，那么他们将能很快地重新点燃印度强大的潜在增长引擎。
Otherwise, India’s youth, their hopes and ambitions frustrated, could decide to take matters into their own hands.	否则的话，希望和梦想破灭的印度青年一代将会揭竿而起，自己决定自己的未来。
	
What Happened to Mohamed al-Hanashi?	穆罕默德·阿尔-哈纳什遭遇了什么？
NEW YORK – Mohammed al-Hanashi was a 31-year-old Yemeni citizen who was held at Guantánamo Bay without charge for seven years.	发自纽约 — — 穆罕默德·阿尔-哈纳什，31岁，一位没有受到任何指控就被关在关塔那摩战俘营长达七年的也门公民。
On June 3, while I was visiting Guantánamo with other journalists, the press office there issued a terse announcement that al-Hanashi had had been found dead in his cell – an “apparent suicide.”	在今年6月3日，当我同其他记者一道参观关塔那摩的时候，那里的新闻办公室公布了一则简短的公告：阿尔-哈纳什被发现死在他自己的牢房内 — — 一起“显而易见的自杀事件 ” 。
Because my commercial flight was canceled, I got a ride back to the United States on a military transport.	因为我原本要搭乘的民用航班被取消，只好乘坐军用航班飞回美国。
I happened to be seated next to a military physician who had been flown in to do the autopsy on al-Hanashi.	而恰巧坐在我旁边的是一位军医，正是他为阿尔-哈纳什做的尸检。
When would there be an investigation of the death, I asked him?	于是我问，何时才会进行针对哈纳什死亡的调查？
“That was the investigation,” he replied.	“这就是调查 。 ” 他回答道。
The military had investigated the military.	看来是军方自己对自己展开了调查。
This “apparent suicide” seemed immediately suspicious to me.	听他这样一说，这起“显而易见的自杀”在我来看来就迅速变得十分可疑。
I had just toured those cells: it is literally impossible to kill yourself in them.	我刚刚参观了这些牢房：如果身处其中的话，你根本就很难杀死自己。
Their interiors resemble the inside of a smooth plastic jar; there are no hard edges; hooks fold down; there is no bedding that one can use to strangle oneself.	牢房内部看上去就好像一个光滑的塑料瓶内里，没有锋利的边缘，没有弯钩，甚至没有任何床上用品可以用来勒死自己。
Can you bang your head against the wall until you die, theoretically, I asked the doctor?	于是我问这位军医，理论上来讲，一个囚犯能一直用头撞墙直到把自己撞死吗？
“They check on prisoners every three minutes,” he said.	“他们每三分钟就来查看一下囚犯 ， ” 他告诉我。
You’d have to be fast.	看来想要这样自杀的话，动作还必须够快。
The story smelled even worse after a bit of digging. Al-Hanashi, it turned out, had been elected by the detainees to serve as their representative.	如果你继续向下挖掘这个问题的话，这就更像一桩疑案：据证实，哈纳什已在狱中被选为在押者代表。
(The Geneva Conventions call for this process but the US did not give it any formal recognition).	（ 《 日内瓦公约》要求进行类似程序，但美国官方并未承认 ） 。
As their designated representative, al-Hanashi knew which prisoners had claimed to have been tortured or abused, and by whom.	而作为代表，哈纳什很清楚哪些囚犯曾受过虐待和折磨，而施暴者又是何人。
On January 17, al-Hanashi, according to his fellow prisoner Binyam Mohamed (who has since been released), was summoned to a meeting with the Admiral of Guantánamo and the head of the Guard Force there.	据哈纳什的狱友宾亚姆·莫哈迈德（随后获释）所说，1月17日，哈纳什被召去，同管辖关塔那摩的海军少将兼看守部队最高长官开了个会。
He never returned to his cell.	接着他就再也没能回到自己的牢房，而是被带到了精神治疗病房。
He was taken to the psychiatric ward, where, according to another prisoner who had been there, he was kept until he died.	根据另一位当时也被关在特别牢房的在押者回忆，哈纳什一直被关在那里，直到死去。
Can you kill yourself in the psych ward?	一个人如何能在一个精神病房里自杀？
According to Cortney Busch of Reprieve, a British organization that represents Guantánamo detainees, there is video running on prisoners in the psychiatric ward at all times, and there is a guard posted there continually, too.	根据来自“解脱行动 ” （ 一个代表关塔那摩在押人员的英国组织）的调查员考特尼·布斯克的报道，精神治疗病房内有24小时监控录像，并安排了一名警卫进行不间断监视。
The day after al-Hanashi died, the nurse and psychologist had shown a group of journalists of which I was a part an oddly defensive display of how hunger-striking prisoners are bound in restraint chairs when being “enterally fed” (that is, force-fed).	在哈纳什死后第二天，监狱的护士和心理医生向包括我在内的一群记者进行了一场奇特的医学防御演示，关于绝食的囚犯是如何被固定在椅子上进行“肠道喂食 ” （ 实际上就是强制喂食 ） 。
Al Hanashi, the press office at Guantánamo noted, had formerly been a hunger striker.	在关塔那摩新闻办公室的记录里显示，哈纳什就曾是一个绝食者。
It is worth considering how easy it would be to do away with a troublesome prisoner being force-fed by merely adjusting the calorie level.	有一点值得我们考虑：除掉一个令人讨厌的囚犯有多么简单，既然他被“强制喂食 ” ， 那么需要做的仅仅是改变他体内卡路里的水平。
If it is too low, the prisoner will starve, but too high a level can also kill, since deliberate liquid overfeeding by tube, to which Guantánamo prisoners have reported being subjected, causes vomiting, diarrhea, and deadly dehydration that can stop one’s heart.	如果卡路里值过低，囚犯会被饿死，但卡路里值过高同样能够杀死他，因为如果有意将过量的液体通过导管输入人体内，就像关塔那摩的犯人据报曾遭受的那样，会最终导致呕吐、腹泻，以及可令人心跳停止的致命脱水症状。
I have been putting questions to Lt. Commander Brook DeWalt, the head spokesman for the Guantánamo press office, about how al-Hanashi died, for eight weeks now.	八周以来，我一直在向海军少校布鲁克·德瓦尔特，这位关塔那摩新闻办公室的首席发言人询问哈纳什的死因。
According to the Yemeni embassy in Washington, al-Hanashi’s body was repatriated in mid-August.	根据也门驻美大使馆的消息，哈纳什的遗体已经于8月中旬遣送回也门国内。
Al Jazeera has reported that the Yemeni government announced only what the US had – that al-Hanashi had died from “asphyxiation.”	卡塔尔半岛电视台报道说，也门政府只宣布了美国的一家之言��也就是声称哈纳什死于“窒息 ” 。
When I noted to DeWalt that self-strangulation was impossible, he said he would get back to me when the inquiry – now including a Naval criminal investigation – was completed.	当我提醒德瓦尔特，哈纳什根本不可能将自己勒毙时，他说等整个调查 — — 如今更包括一份海军犯罪调查 — — 结束之后就会回复我。
I have yet to receive an answer.	但我至今还没能收到任何回应。
The Yemeni government, too, notes that they have yet to receive the coroner’s report from the US.	而也门政府也说他们至今还没有收到来自美国的验尸报告。
An investigation by the military of the death of its own prisoners violates the Geneva Conventions, which demand that illness, transfer, and death of prisoners be registered independently with a neutral authority (such as the ICRC), and that deaths be investigated independently.	由军方自己对其内部囚犯来展开死亡调查的行为，显然违背了《日内瓦公约》的要求：囚犯的病患、移交和死亡都要由某个中立的职权机构进行登记（例如国际红十字会 ） , 而对死亡案例也需进行独立调查。
If governments let no outside entity investigate the circumstances of such deaths, what will keep them from “disappearing” whomever they take into custody, for whatever reason?	如果连政府都禁止其他第三方机构介入调查这类死亡案例的话，那又有什么能制止政府用任何理由去“消灭”任何被关押的人呢？
I sent DeWalt a copy of the relevant section of the Geneva Conventions and asked how the US military’s handling of al-Hanashi’s death conforms to it.	我给德瓦尔特发了一份《日内瓦公约》相关条款的文本，并询问他美国军方是如何根据公约来处理哈纳什的死亡的。
Actually, I sent it twice. Again, no answer.	实际上，我发了两次：结果一样，石沉大海。
Was al-Hanashi suicidal?	阿尔-哈纳什有自杀倾向吗？
Binyam Mohamed told the Associated Press that al-Hanashi was a positive person (and, one can assume, a natural leader) who would never consider suicide.	宾亚姆·莫哈迈德告诉美联社，哈纳什是一个乐观积极的人 ， （ 可以想象，他也是一位天生的领导者）一个永远都不会想要自杀的人。
He had been in custody for seven years without a lawyer, and killed himself just two weeks after having finally been assigned one?	他在没有任何律师的情况下被关押了7年，却在刚刚被分配了一个之后仅仅两周时间就结束了自己的生命？
That lawyer, Elizabeth Gilson, probably knows al-Hanashi’s state of mind before he died, but the US government will not allow her to talk about it.	那位名叫伊丽莎白·吉尔森的律师很可能清楚哈纳什死前的心理状况，但美国政府却不会允许她去谈论这些。
What happened to Mohamed al-Hanashi, and why?	究竟哈纳什遭遇了什么，这些遭遇因何而起？
The fact that no one can answer this question yet means that even in Barack Obama’s America, as in Stalin’s Russia or Ahmadinejad’s Iran, people can simply be disappeared without trial.	事实上这个没人能回答的问题意味着，即使是奥巴马治下的美国，仍然好像斯大林时代的苏联或艾哈迈迪·内贾德统治下的伊朗一样，人民凭空“消失 ” ， 连审判过程都不必经过。
The world’s law-abiding governments and ordinary citizens should call and email DeWalt, the Pentagon, and the White House press office to demand answers.	世界上所有守法政府和普罗大众都应当致电或发邮件质问德瓦尔特，五角大楼以及白宫新闻办公室，要求他们给出答案。
A young man with a great deal of potentially compromising information died under suspicious circumstances in US custody.	一个知晓众多潜在性危险信息的年轻人在美军监狱中离奇死亡。
The facts concerning his case must be independently verified.	而和他的死亡有关的一切事实，都必须得到独立的查证。

Ireland and the Austerity Debate	爱尔兰和紧缩争论
DUBLIN – Both sides of the austerity debate that is now gripping economists and policymakers cite Ireland’s experience as evidence for their case.	都柏林—如今，让经济学家和决策者深陷其中的紧缩争论的双方都在引用爱尔兰的经验作为论据。
And, however much they try to position the country as a poster-child, neither side is able to convince the other.	而不管他们如何尽力地将爱尔兰树立为榜样模范，都不能让对方就范。
Yet this tug-of-war is important, because it illustrates the complex range of arguments that are in play.	但这场拔河十分重要，因为这说明了观点角逐的复杂程度。
It also demonstrates why more conclusive economic policy making is proving so elusive.	这还说明了为何难以出现决定性的经济决策。
Here is a quick reminder of Ireland’s sad recent economic history.	让我们先来快速回顾一下爱尔兰近期的悲惨经济史。
Lulled into complacency and excess by ample supplies of artificially cheap financing, Irish banks went on a lending binge.	爱尔兰银行因为供应充足的认为廉价金融而得意洋洋，不知节制地进入了信贷款黄。
Irresponsible risk-taking and excessive greed outpaced prudential regulation and supervision.	不负责任的冒险和过度贪婪压倒了审慎监管和监督。
The banking system ended up fueling massive speculation, including a huge run-up in real-estate prices, only to be brought to its knees when the bubbles popped.	最后，银行系统助长了全民投机，包括房地产价格的飙升，而当泡沫破裂时，爱尔兰也轰然倒下。
Unlike the many Irish households that lost jobs and part of their wealth, the banks were deemed to be “too big to fail,” so Ireland’s political elites intervened with state funding.	与许多失去了工作和部分财富的爱尔兰家庭不同，银行被认为“太大而不能倒 ” ， 因此爱尔兰政治精英用国家资金出手干预。
But, by under-estimating both the domestic and international aspects of the problem, the authorities transformed a banking problem into a national tragedy.	但是，由于当局在国内和国际两个角度都低估了问题的严重性，银行问题演变成了一场国家悲剧。
Rather than restoring the banks to financial health and ensuring responsible behavior, the Irish economy as a whole was dragged down.	爱尔兰经济并未让银行恢复财务健康、保证其做出负责任的行为。 整个爱尔兰经济都受到了拖累。
Growth collapsed; unemployment spiked.	增长崩盘；事业飙升。
Lacking opportunities, emigration increased – a vivid reminder of how economic crises have wreaked havoc on the country’s demographics throughout its history.	由于缺少机会，移民人数大增 — — 生动地再次展示了历史上一再发生的经济危机给爱尔兰人口带来的浩劫。
Investors withdrew in droves from what was once deemed the “Celtic Tiger.”	投资者纷纷逃离昔日的“凯尔特之虎 ” 。
The government had no choice but to request a bailout from the “troika” – the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank, and the European Commission – thereby transferring an important component of national economic governance to an ad hoc, fragile, and sometimes feuding group of institutions.	政府别无选择，只能从“三驾马车 ” （ IMF、欧洲央行和欧盟委员会）寻求帮助，也因此将国民经济治理的重要部分移交给了临时组建的、脆弱的、时不时互相扯皮的机构集团。
While other struggling eurozone members also turned to the troika, Ireland stands out in at least two notable ways.	其他陷入麻烦的欧元区成员国也转向三驾马车寻求帮助，但至少从两个方面看，爱尔兰特别引人关注。
First, two democratically-elected governments have steadfastly implemented the agreed austerity programs with little need for waivers and modifications – and thus without the associated political drama.	首先，两届民选政府坚定不移地实施了谈定的紧缩计划，几乎没有要求不执行和修改的需要，因此也没有出现相应的政治闹剧。
Second, despite enduring considerable pain, Irish society has stuck with the program, staging few of the street protests that have been common in other austerity-hit countries.	其次，尽管经历了巨大的痛苦，但爱尔兰社会坚持了方案，几乎没有出现其他受紧缩影响的国家所经常出现的街头抗议。
All of this puts Ireland in the middle of three important issues raised in the austerity debates: whether orthodox policy, with its heavy emphasis on immediate budget cuts, can restore conditions for growth, employment gains, and financial stability; whether the benefits of eurozone membership still outweigh the costs for countries that must restructure their economies; and how a small, open economy should strategically position itself in today’s world.	所有这些让爱尔兰处于紧缩争论所引出的三个重要问题的中间地带：正统政策 — — 非常强调马上削减预算 — — 是否能为增长、就业改善和金融稳定重新创造条件？ 对一些国家来说，欧元区成员国的好处是否仍能压倒经济重组的成本？
	小型开放经济应该如何在当今世界中给自己定位？
Austerity’s supporters point to the fact that Ireland is on the verge of “graduating” from the troika’s program.	紧缩支持者指出一个事实：爱尔兰快要从三驾马车方案中“毕业”了。
Growth has resumed, financial-risk premia have fallen sharply, foreign investment is picking up, and exports are booming.	增长重现曙光、金融风险溢价大幅下降、外国投资增加、贸易走向繁荣。
All of this, they argue, provides the basis for sustainable growth and declining unemployment.	他们认为，所有这些为可持续增长和失业下降创造了条件。
Ireland, they conclude, was right to stay in the eurozone, especially because small, open economies that are unanchored can be easily buffeted by a fluid global economy.	他们的结论是，爱尔兰留在欧元区是正确的，特别是因为失去锚的小型开放经济容易被全球经济大潮吞噬。
“Not so fast,” says the other side.	“还早着呢 ， ” 另一方反驳说。
The critics of austerity point to the fact that Irish GDP has still not returned to its 2007 level.	紧缩批评者指出一个事实：爱尔兰GDP仍没有回到2007年的水平。
Unemployment remains far too high, with alarming levels of long-term and youth joblessness.	失业率仍然太高，长期和年轻人失业状况令人警觉。
Public debt remains too high as well, and, making matters worse, much more of it is now owed to official rather than private creditors (which would complicate debt restructuring should it become necessary).	公共债务也依然太高，更加糟糕的是，相比以前，如今多得多的部分持有在官方而不是私人债权人手中（这会导致不得不进行债务重组时局面更加混乱 ） 。
The critics reject the argument that small, open economies are necessarily better off in a monetary union, pointing to how well Switzerland is coping.	批评者还反驳了小型开放经济留在货币联盟中会更好的观点，并以瑞士为例。
And they lament that eurozone membership means that Ireland’s “internal devaluations,” which involve significant cuts in real wages, have not yet run their course.	他们还哀叹，欧元区成员资格意味着爱尔兰“内部贬值 ” （ 包括大规模削减真实工资）尚未见效。
The data on the “Irish experiment” – including the lack of solid counterfactuals – are not conclusive enough for one side to declare a decisive victory.	“爱尔兰实验”数据（包括缺少扎实的对照）不足以让任何一方取得决定性的胜利。
Yet there is some good analytical news.	但也不乏出色的分析性消息。
Ireland provides insights that are helpful in understanding how sociopolitical systems, including economically devastated countries like Cyprus and Greece, have coped so far with shocks that were essentially unthinkable just a few years ago.	爱尔兰提供的洞见有助于理解社会政治系统（包括经济遭受重创的塞浦路斯和希腊等国家）是如何应对几年前无法想象的冲击的。
On my current visit, most of the Irish citizens with whom I have spoken say that the country had no alternative but to follow the path of austerity.	从我最近对爱尔兰的访问看，我所接触的大部分爱尔兰人表示该国别无选择，只能走紧缩之路。
While they appreciate the urgent need for growth and jobs, they believe that this can be achieved only after Ireland’s finances are put back on a sound footing.	他们认同增长和就业的迫切需要，但认为这些只有在爱尔兰金融恢复稳定后才能实现。
They also argue that, given the banks’ irresponsibility, there is no quick way to promote sustained expansion.	他们还指出，由于银行的不负责任，无法快速推进持续扩张。
They are still angry at bankers, but have yet to gain proper retribution.	他们对银行家仍然充满了愤怒，但还没有对他们进行合理的惩罚。
Ireland’s accumulation of wealth during its Celtic Tiger period, when the country surged toward the top of Europe’s economic league table, has also been an effective shock absorber.	在凯尔特之虎时期 — — 在这段时间里，爱尔兰在欧洲经济竞赛中独拔头筹 — — 所积累的财富也是有效的冲击吸收器。
This, together with fears about being left out in the geopolitical cold (despite the country’s historical links with Britain and America), dampens Irish enthusiasm for economic experiments outside the eurozone.	这，以及对被遗弃于地缘政治寒带（尽管爱尔兰历史上与英国和美国关系紧密）的恐惧，抑制了爱尔兰人在欧元区之外做经济实验的热情。
Indeed, Irish society seems remarkably hesitant to change course. Right or wrong, Ireland will stick with austerity.	事实上，爱尔兰社会似乎对转变道路极为犹豫。
Efforts to regain national control of the country’s destiny, the Irish seem to believe, must take time.	不管对错，爱尔兰人认为，重新获得对国家命运的掌握需要时间。
In some of Europe’s other struggling countries, however, citizens may well prove less patient.	但是，其他一些受困欧洲国家的人民似乎没有那么有耐心。
	
What is Full Employment?	什么是充分就业？
CAMBRIDGE – In an important sense, the US economy is now at full employment.	美国剑桥—在某种很重要的意义上，美国经济目前处于充分就业状态。
The relatively tight labor market is causing wages to rise at an accelerating rate, because employers must pay more to attract and retain employees.	相对较紧的劳动力市场正在让工资加速增长，因为雇主必须提高待遇吸引和留住雇员。
This has important implications for policymakers – and not just at the Federal Reserve.	这给决策者 — — 不仅仅是美联储 — — 带来了重要影响。
Consider this: Average hourly earnings in May were 2.3% higher than in May 2014; but, since the beginning of this year, hourly earnings are up 3.3%, and in May alone rose at a 3.8% rate – a clear sign of full employment.	请考虑：5月平均时薪比2014年5月高了2.3 % ； 但是，自今年年初以来，时薪增加了3.3 % ， 光是5月就增加了3.8 % — —这是充分就业的明确信号。
The acceleration began in 2013 as labor markets started to tighten.	工资加速增长始于2013年劳动力市场开始趋紧时。
Average compensation per hour rose just 1.1% from 2012 to 2013, but then increased at a 2.6% rate from 2013 to 2014, and at 3.3% in the first quarter of 2015.	2012—2013年，平均时薪只增长了1.1 % ， 2013—2014年加快到2.6 % ， 2015年首季度达到了3.3 % 。
These wage increases will soon show up in higher price inflation.	这一工资增长很快就会表现在物价通胀中。
The link between wages and prices is currently being offset by the sharp decline in the price of oil and gasoline relative to a year ago, and by the strengthening of the dollar relative to other currencies.	目前，工资和物价的联系因为石油和汽油价格的相对于一年前急剧下跌以及美元相对于其他货币升值而被抵消。
But, as these factors’ impact on the overall price level diminishes, the inflation rate will rise more rapidly.	但是，随着这些因素对总体物价水平的影响的消失，通胀率将以更快的速度升高。
Accelerating wage growth implies that the economy is now at a point at which increases in demand created by easier monetary policy or expansionary fiscal policy would not achieve a sustained rise in output and employment.	工资增长加速意味着经济目前处于由宽松货币政策或扩张性财政政策所制造的需求增长无法带来产出和就业持续增长的状态。
Instead, this demand would be channeled into higher wages and prices.	相反，这一需求将传导给更高的工资和物价。
There are of course other definitions of full employment.	当然，充分就业还有其他定义。
Some would say that the United States is not at full employment, because 8.7 million people – about 6% of those who are employed – are looking for work.	一些人认为美国尚未达到充分就业，因为870万人 — — 相当于被雇用人数的6 % — —正在找工作。
There are millions more who would like to work but are not actively looking, because they believe that there are no available jobs for people like themselves.	数百万想工作的人没有在积极找工作，因为他们认为像自己这样的人找不到工作。
And an additional 6.7 million are working part-time but would like to work more hours per week.	还有670万人想每周工作更长时间的人正在做兼职。
In many cases, these unemployed and underemployed individuals are experiencing real hardship.	在许多例子中，这些失业和半失业个人正在经历名副其实的困境。
By that indicator, the US economy is not at full employment.	从这个指标看，美国并未达到充分就业。
But, for the Fed, it is, in the sense that excessively easy monetary policy can no longer achieve a sustained increase in employment.	但是，对美联储来说，美国已经达到充分就业，因为过度宽松的货币政策已不再带来就业的持续增加。
At the same time, other types of policies that change incentives or remove barriers can lead to increased employment and higher real incomes, without raising wage and price inflation.	与此同时，其他改变激励或消除壁垒的政策类型可以带来就业增加和真实收入上涨而不会导致工资和物价通胀。
Consider, for example, the high rate of non-employment among men aged 25 to 54, a group too old to be in school and too young to retire.	比如，考虑25—54岁男性的无就业（non-employment）率。 这一群体已经离开校园，但又没有达到退休年龄。
More than 15% of men in this age group are not employed.	其中超过15%的人没有被雇用。
Among those in this age range who have less than a high school education, 35% are not employed.	其中文化程度在高中以下的，有35%没有被雇用。
Programs to provide market-relevant education and training should be able to raise employment among this group.	提供市场相关教育和培训的计划应该能够提高该群体的就业情况。
Or consider the employment experience of men and women over age 65.	或者考虑65岁以上男性和女性的就业经验。
This group is eligible for Social Security (pensions) and Medicare (health insurance), and the majority are retired.	该群体有资格获得社会保障（退休金）和医疗保险（Medicare ） ， 其中大部分人都已经退休。
But experience shows that the decision to retire or to work fewer hours is influenced by the compensation that members of this group receive.	但经验表明退休或减少工作时长的决定受到该群体成员能获得多少报酬的影响很大。
And this amount partly reflects the fact that employed people who collect Social Security and Medicare are subject to the payroll tax that finances them.	而这一数字部分反映了一个事实：有社会保障和医疗保险的受雇人群受到为这些收入提供资金的工资税的影响。
The payroll tax paid by employees is 6.65% (employers pay the same rate), and is in addition to the personal income tax.	雇员支付的工资税率为6.65 % （ 雇主也支付相同税率 ） ， 这一税种在个人所得税之外额外征收。
Moreover, because of the complex rules that govern the level of Social Security benefits, the older worker who pays this payroll tax is likely to receive no extra benefits.	此外，由于决定社会保障福利水平的规则十分复杂，支付这一工资税的年长工人有可能根本无法获得额外社会保障福利。
For many older workers, the choice is not whether to work, but how much.	对许多年长工人来说，面临的选择不是工不工作，而是工作多少。
We now have less than full employment in the sense that the payroll tax encourages older workers to work fewer hours than they otherwise would.	工资税鼓励年长工人工作更少时间，从这个意义上讲，我们还没有达到充分就业。
The Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”) also reduces hours worked, in two different ways.	平价医疗法（Affordable Care Act，即“奥巴马医改 ” ） 也从两个不同方面降低了工作时长。
First, for some individuals, working fewer hours reduces incomes enough to entitle them to a larger government subsidy for health insurance.	首先，对一些个人来说，减少工作时长所导致的收入降低足以是他们有资格获得更大的政府医疗保险补贴。
Second, some employers are being incented to reduce the number of working hours for individual employees, because, above a specified number, Obamacare imposes a larger burden on them.	其次，一些雇主获得激励减少个体雇员的工作时长，因为超过一定时常，奥巴马医改就会给它们带来更大的负担。
Or consider minimum-wage legislation, which reduces employers’ willingness to hire low-skilled workers.	或者考虑最低工资立法，该理发降低了雇主聘用低技能工人的意愿。
As the minimum wage is increased, employers’ incentive to substitute equipment or more skilled employees strengthens.	随着最低工资的提高，雇主用设备或熟练雇员的激励也增强了。
This reduction in the demand for low-skilled workers could be offset by taking into account the hourly equivalent of transfer payments when calculating the minimum wage.	这降低了低技能工人的需求，但可以通过在计算最低工资时考虑等价每小时转移支付来抵销。
For example, someone who receives $8,000 a year in transfer payments (such as food stamps, housing assistance, and the Earned Income Tax Credit) might be deemed to have received the equivalent of $4 an hour toward meeting the minimum wage.	比如，某人每年获得8,000美元转移支付（如食品券、住房补贴和工作所得税收优惠 ） ， 他有可能被认定为获得了相当于4美元时薪，这将被算入他的最低工资。
That individual’s combined income would be achieved with a lower cost to the employer, increasing the individual’s ability to find employment.	因此，在计算总收入时，雇的成本将有所降低，这增加了他找工作的能力。
I could easily extend this list.	我还可以轻松地继续扩展这一清单。
The basic point is that employment can be increased, and unemployment decreased, by removing barriers to job creation and reducing marginal tax rates.	基本要点是就业可以通过消除就业创造壁垒和降低边际税率增加，失业也可以通过这两个办法减少。
By contrast, increasing demand by prolonging easy monetary policy or expanding fiscal spending is likely to result in rising inflation rather than rising employment.	相反，通过延长宽松货币政策或扩张性财政政策增加需求有可能导致通胀抬头而非就业增加。
	
What Is Resilience?	什么是恢复力
CANBERRA – “Resilience,” like love, is difficult to define.	堪培拉 — “ 恢复力”就像是爱情，难以定义。
Yet everyone – from United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to government agencies, company boards, and community groups – is talking about how to build or maintain it.	但所有人 — — 从联合国秘书长潘基文到政府机构、公司董事会和社会团体 — — 都在谈论如何建立和保持恢复力。
So, is resilience a useful concept or just a fleeting buzzword?	那么，恢复力是一个有用的概念，还是仅仅是一个昙花一现的流行词？
To answer that question, we need to start with a different one: How much do you think you can change without becoming a different person?	回答这个问题需要从一个不同的问题开始：你认为在不变成另一个人的前提下，你可以变化多少？
How much can an ecosystem, city, or business change before it looks and functions like a different kind of ecosystem, city, or business?	一个生态系统、城市或企业在成为不同类型的生态系统、城市和企业的情况下可以变化多少？
All of these are self-organizing systems.	所有这些都是自我组织的系统。
Your body, for example, maintains a constant temperature of approximately 37 degrees Celsius.	比如，你的身体温度恒定在37摄氏度左右。
If your body temperature rises, you start to sweat in order to cool down; if your temperature falls, your muscles vibrate (shiver) to warm up.	如果体温上升，你就会出汗降温；如果你的体温下降，你的肌肉颤动（发抖）暖身。
Your body relies on negative feedbacks to keep it functioning in the same way.	同样地，你的身体依靠负反馈保持运转。
That is basically the definition of resilience: the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance, re-organize, and keep functioning in much the same way as before.	这就是恢复力的基本定义：系统吸收干扰、重新组织并保持像从前一样运转的能力。
But there are limits, or thresholds, to a system’s resilience, beyond which it assumes a different way of functioning – a different identity.	但一个系统的恢复力存在极限或者阈值，过之则意味着不同的运转方式 — — 不同的身份。
Many coral reefs that were once home to a rich diversity of fish, for example, have become algal or turf ecosystems with very few fish.	比如，许多曾经是多种鱼类栖身之所的珊瑚礁变成了鲜有鱼类踪迹的海藻和海洋植物生态系统。
Two main thresholds dictate this change in coral reefs.	两个关键阈值控制着珊瑚礁的变化。
The more nutrients that enter the water (run-off from nearby land), the more the algae are favored, until, at some point, they take over.	水中的营养素越多（来自附近陆地 ） ， 对藻类就越有利，直到在某一个点上它们取代了珊瑚礁。
Likewise, if too many herbivorous fish are removed, algae gain a competitive advantage over the corals.	类似地，如果食草鱼类大量消失，海藻也会赢得相对珊瑚的竞争优势。
These two thresholds interact: the more nutrients there are, the less fishing is needed to “flip” the system into the algal state; and the fewer fish there are, the less nutrients are needed.	这两大阈值相互作用：营养越丰富，将系统“转换”为海藻世界所需要的鱼类数量就越少；而鱼类数量越少，所需要的营养也越少。
Moreover, thresholds can move as the environment changes.	此外，阈值可能随环境变化而变化。
In the coral reef example, both the nutrient and fish thresholds fall as sea temperatures rise and the oceans become more acidic.	在珊瑚礁的例子中，营养和鱼类数量阈值对着海洋温度上升和海水酸性增加而下降。
So, as climate change proceeds, smaller incremental rises in nutrient levels and drops in fish stocks will flip coral reefs to algal states.	因此，随着气候的变化，较小的营养水平上升和鱼类数量下降也会触发珊瑚礁转换为海藻世界。
Thresholds also occur in social systems: think of fads or, more seriously, riot behavior in crowds.	社会系统也存在阈值：比如时尚或者更严重的群体暴动。
In business, the debt/income ratio is a well-known threshold, one that can move in step with exchange rates.	在商业领域，债务/收入比率是一个广为人知的阈值，会随着汇率的变化而变化。
Threshold effects have also been identified in labor supply, transport services, and other determinants of companies’ well-being.	阈值效应还可以存在于劳动力供给、通勤服务和其他公司福利决定因素上。
Given the importance of threshold effects, how can a system’s resilience be maintained?	既然阈值效应如此重要，系统如何保持其恢复力呢？
For starters, making a system very resilient in one way can cause it to lose resilience in other ways.	首先，让一个系统在某一方面具有超强恢复力会导致它其他方面失去恢复力。
So we have to understand and enhance general resilience – a system’s capacity to cope with a variety of shocks, in all aspects of its functioning.	因此我们必须理解并增强总体恢复力 — — 系统应对各种 — — 全方位影响其运转的 — — 冲击的能力。
From research on a variety of systems, the following attributes have been shown to confer general resilience:	从关于各种系统的研究中我们得出，下列因素决定着总体回复力：
· A high degree of diversity, especially response diversity (different ways of doing the same thing, often mistakenly thought of as “redundancy”).	· 高度的多样性，特别是反应多样性（用不同的方法做同一件事，常被误解为“冗余性 ” ） 。
· A relatively modular structure that does not over-connect its components.	· 相对模块化的结构，各成分之间不会过度连接。
· A strong capacity to respond quickly to change.	· 强大的快速响应变化的能力。
· Significant “openness,” allowing emigration and immigration of all components (closed systems remain static).	· 高度“开放 ” ， 各组成成分可流进流出（封闭系统是静态的 ） 。
· Maintenance of adequate reserves – for example, seed banks in ecosystems or memory in social systems (which speaks against just-in-time supply services).	· 维持重组的储备 — — 比如生态系统中的种子银行和社会系统中的记忆（与即时供给服务相对 ） 。
· Encouragement of innovation and creativity.	· 鼓励创新和创造力。
· High social capital, particularly trust, leadership, and social networks.	· 高度的社会资本，特别是信任、领导力和社交网络。
· Adaptive governance (flexible, distributive, and learning-based).	· 适应性治理（灵活、分布式且以学习为基础 ） 。
These attributes comprise the essentials of a resilient system.	这些因素构成了高恢复力系统的基础。
But resilience itself is neither “good” nor “bad.”	但恢复力本身没有“好 ” “ 坏”可言。
Undesirable systems, such as dictatorships and saline landscapes, can be very resilient.	不良的系统 — — 比如独裁和盐碱地 — — 可能恢复力很强。
In these cases, the system’s resilience should be reduced.	在这些例��中，系统恢复力应该被削弱。
Moreover, it is impossible to understand or manage a system’s resilience at only one scale.	此外，不可能在一个规模水平上理解和管理一个系统的恢复力。
At least three must be included – the focal scale and at least one below and one above – for cross-scale connections most often determine a system’s longer-term resilience.	至少需要包括三个规模水平 — — 核心规模和及其上下各一个规模 — — 跨规模联系是最普遍的决定系统长期恢复力的因素。
Most losses in resilience are unintended consequences of narrowly focused optimization (like an “efficiency” drive) that fails to recognize feedback effects on the focal scale that stem from changes produced by such optimization at another scale.	大部分恢复力损失来自狭隘优化的意外后果（比如追求“效率 ” ） ，此类优化无法识别来自另一规模的这类优化所造成的变化引起的对核心规模的反馈效应。
Resilience should not be confused with resistance to change.	恢复力不能和变化抵抗力混淆。
On the contrary, trying to prevent change and disturbance to a system reduces its resilience.	相反，试图阻止对某系统的变化和干扰会降低其恢复力。
A forest that never burns eventually loses species capable of withstanding fire.	从不着火的森林最终会失去能抵御火灾的物种。
Children who are prevented from playing in dirt grow up with compromised immune systems.	被禁止玩泥巴的儿童长大后免疫系统功能偏低。
Building and maintaining resilience requires probing its boundaries.	建立和维持恢复力需要探索系统的边界。
If a shift into a “bad” state has already happened, or is inevitable and will be irreversible, the only option is transformation into a different kind of system – a new way of living (and making a living).	如果向“坏”状态的变化已经发生，或者这一变化不可避免且将不可逆转，那么唯一的选择是变为不同类型的系统 — — 新的生存方式（和谋生之道 ） 。
Transformability and resilience are not opposites.	可变性和恢复力并不是对立的。
In order for a system to remain resilient at one scale, parts of it at other scales may have to transform.	一个系统要维持某个规模水平的恢复力，其在其他规模水平上的一些部分就必须变化。
In Australia, for example, the Murray-Darling basin cannot continue as a resilient agricultural region if all parts of it continue doing what they are doing now.	比如，在澳大利亚，如果穆雷-达令（Murray-Darling）盆地的所有部分继续今天的作为，那么它就不可能继续成为高回复力的农业区。
There simply is not enough water.	那里没有足够的水。
So some parts of it will have to transform.	其中一些部分必须变化。
Of course, the need for transformation to create or maintain resilience may also affect the highest scale: If some countries and regions are to remain (or become) resilient social-ecological systems with high human well-being, it may be necessary to transform the global financial system.	当然，变化从而创造或维持恢复力的需要也可能影响最高规模：如果一些国家和地区要维持（或变成）高恢复力社会-生态系统，与此同时保持人类高福利，那么全球金融系统就必须变化。
Transformation requires getting past denial, creating options for change, and supporting novelty and experimentation.	变化需要否定部分，创造出变化的选择，并支持创新和实验。
Financial support from higher levels (government) all too often takes the form of help not to change (bailouts of too-big-to-fail banks, for example), rather than help to change.	来自更高水平（政府）的金融支持总是以有助于不变化的形式出现（比如援助太大而不可倒的银行 ） ， 而不是以有助于变化的形式出现。
Resilience, in short, is largely about learning how to change in order not to be changed.	简言之，恢复力大体上是关于如何以变化防止被变化的东西。
Certainty is impossible.	确定性是不存在的。
The point is to build systems that will be safe when they fail, not to try to build fail-safe systems.	要点是建立倒闭时仍安全的系统，而不是建立不会倒闭的系统。
	
What is the Deficit Endgame?	财政赤字何去何从？
REYKJAVIK – No one yet has any real idea about when the global financial crisis will end, but one thing is certain: government budget deficits are headed into the stratosphere.	雷克亚未克 — — 没有人知道全球金融危机什么时候才会结束。 但有一点是肯定的：政府的财政赤字将达到一个惊人的水平。
Investors in the coming years will need to be persuaded to hold mountains of new debt.	在接下来的日子里，投资者将被迫购买大量的新发国债。
Although governments may try to cram public debt down the throats of local savers (by using, for example, their rising influence over banks to force them to hold a disproportionate quantity of government paper), they will eventually find themselves having to pay much higher interest rates as well.	虽然政府可以将债务转嫁到本国储户的头上（例如，政府利用自身的影响力来迫使银行持有大量的国债。 ） ， 但他们最终也会发现，为此会支付利息也是可观的。
Within a couple years, interest rates on long-term US Treasury notes could easily rise 3-4%, with interest rates on other governments’ paper rising as much, or more.	在接下来的几年中，美国政府长期债券的利率很快就会升到3-4 % ， 其他国家还会更高。
Interest rates will rise to compensate investors both for having to accept a larger share of government bonds in their portfolio and for an increasing risk that governments will be tempted to inflate away the value of their debts, or even default.	利率的升高主要有来自两个方面：一是补偿对投资人大量持有政府债券。 二是补偿国债通货膨胀后的损失，以及违约偿还的风险。
In research that Carmen Reinhart and I have done on the history of financial crises, we find that public debt typically doubles, even adjusting for inflation, in the three years following a crisis.	根据我和卡门·莱因哈特对历史发生上的已经金融危机研究后得出的结果：在金融危机发生后的三年中，即使除去通货膨胀的因素，国债也会翻倍。
Many nations, large and small, are now well on the way to meeting this projection.	现在很多国家都在朝着这个模式发展。
China’s government has clearly indicated that it will use any means necessary to backstop growth in the face of a free fall in exports.	中国政府明确表示，他们会使用一切手段，阻止出口下滑的趋势。
The Chinese have $2 trillion in hard currency reserves to back up their promise.	当然，他们有2万亿美元的外汇储备作为保证。
President Barack Obama’s new budget calls for a stunning $1.75 trillion deficit in the United States, a multiple of the previous record.	美国总统巴拉克·奥巴马最新推出了财政预算，高达1万7千5百亿美元，是以往最高时期的几倍。
Even those countries that are not actively engaged in a fiscal orgy are seeing their surpluses collapse and their deficits soar, mainly in the face of falling tax revenues.	即使那些没有陷于金融危机的国家也会发现，由于税收所得的下降，外汇储备正在崩溃，财政赤字激增。
Indeed, few governments have submitted remotely realistic budget projections, typically relying on overly rosy economic scenarios.	实际上，几乎没有政府会提交符合现实的财政预算报告，通常都描述一个过于乐观的 经济前景。
Unfortunately, in 2009, the global economy will not be a bed of roses.	不幸的是，2009年的经济将不再是“鲜花烂漫 ” 。
Income in the US and euro-area both appear to have declined at an annualized rate of roughly 6% in the fourth quarter of 2008; Japan’s GDP fell at perhaps twice that rate.	如果按年计算的话，08年的第4季度，美国和欧元区国家财政收入几乎都下滑了6 % ， 日本更惨，可能是上者的两倍。
China’s claim that its GDP grew at a 6% rate, during the end of last year, is suspect.	中国公布的数字显示，去年底的GDP增长了6 % ， 这个数字令人怀疑。
Exports have collapsed throughout Asia, including Korea, Japan, and Singapore. Arguably India, and to a lesser extent Brazil, have been holding out a bit better.	在整个亚洲，出口已经开始崩盘，涉及的国家包括韩国，日本和新加坡，印度或许也能算上。 巴西受害的程度低一些，情况会好一点。
But few emerging markets have reached a stage at which they can withstand a sustained collapse in the developed economies, much less serve as substitute engines of global growth.	但新兴市场的经济发展不可能抗得住来自发达国家那边所承受如此的损失，目前，他们还没有能力带动整个经济走向好转。
With the credit crisis still making it difficult for many small and medium-size businesses to obtain even the minimal level of financing necessary to maintain inventories and conduct trade, global GDP is on a precipice in 2009.	随着信贷危机的加深，中小企业很难获得贷款，连维持他们日常的存货和运营所需的最低水平资金都没有保证。
There is a real possibility that global growth will register its first contraction since World War II.	在2009年，全球的GDP已经处于悬崖边上，有可能出现自从二战以后的首次负增长。
In all likelihood, a slew of countries will see output declines of 4-5% in 2009, with some. having true depression level drops, of 10% or more.	如此说来，2009年许多国家经济会下滑4-5 % ， 一些国家甚至会下降10%甚至更多，进入实际的经济萧条期。
Worse yet, unless financial systems spring back, growth could disappoint for years to come, especially in “ground zero” countries such as the United States, Britain, Ireland and Spain. US long-term growth could be particularly dismal, as the Obama administration steers the country toward more European levels of welfare assistance and income redistribution,	更为糟糕的是，除非金融系统转好，否则经济的增长会在许多年内都不可能发生，尤其是在“零汇率”的国家，例如美国，英国，爱尔兰和西班牙等。 随着奥巴马的社会福利改革及收入再分配的方案，美国也将会越来越倾向于欧洲的模式，长期的经济形势会变得更糟。
Countries with European-style growth rates could handle debt obligations of 60% of GDP when interest rates were low.	目前，利率还维持低水平，欧洲模式国家的债务已经占GDP的60 % 。
But, with debts in many countries rising to 80% or 90% of GDP, and with today’s low interest rates clearly a temporary phenomenon, trouble is brewing.	而对于那些那些债务高达GDP80%甚至90%的国家来说，问题会变的越来越严重。
Many of the countries that are piling on massive quantities of debt to bail out their banks have only tepid medium term growth prospects, raising real questions of solvency and sustainability	更不用说目前明显偏低利率维持时间不会太长，很多国家为了拯救银行系统已经背负了大量的债务，将来，偿还债务的能力和经济的稳定性也会是个大问题。
Italy, for example with a debt-to-income ratio already exceeding 100%, has been able to manage so far thanks to falling global rates.	意大利就是一个例子，债务和收入的比例已经超过100 % ， 有幸的是下滑的全球利率，目前还暂时能维持。
But as debts mount, and global interest rates rise, investors will become rightly nervous about the risk of debt restructuring.	不过随着债务的增加，全球利率的回升，投资者对债务重组的风险也肯定会越来越担心。
Other countries, such as Ireland, Britain, and the US, started with a much stronger fiscal position, but may not be much better off when the smoke clears.	爱尔兰，英国和美国等国家的经济底子还算厚一些，不过在“警报”解除之前，情况也好不到哪里去。
Exchange rates are another wild card.	汇率也是一个要考虑的因素。
Asian central banks are still nervously clinging to the dollar. But with the US printing debt and money like it is going out of style, it would appear the euro is set to appreciate against the dollar two or three years down the road, if the euro is still around, that is.	亚洲国家的中央银行正紧张地盯着美元的汇率，但随着美国增发国债和大量印制钞票，以上的做法看来有些过时。 欧元对美元的汇率在最近两三年内一直在升值，欧洲国家的做法好象看起来更为正确 ， 。
As debt mounts and the recession lingers, we are surely going to see a number of governments trying to lighten their load through financial repression, higher inflation, partial default, or a combinations of all three.	随着债务的增加和持续的经济萧条，我们相信，越来越多的国家会采取金融紧缩，高通货膨胀以及债务部分免除等三种方法，也可能是以上方法的组合。
Unfortunately, the endgame to the great recession of the 2000’s will not be a pretty picture.	不幸的是，结束2000年危机的方式将不会是很乐观的。
	
What is the West?	西方究竟为何物？
PARIS -- Everyone everywhere has by now heard about the “clash of civilizations.”	巴黎 - - 世界各地的人们现在都已经听说了所谓的“文明的冲突 ” 。
This Samuel Huntington concept has become universal.	亨廷顿的这一概念已经家喻户晓。
In the 1950’s, the French economist, Alfred Sauvy had a comparable success with the expression “third world.”	五十年代，法国经济学家索维创造了“第三世界”一词也同样人人皆知。
One reason these phrases gain wide acceptance is their lack of clear definition.	这些词语之所以为大众所接受是因为它们定义模糊。
The “clash of civilizations,” basically the West against the rest, is supposed to describe the world as it is.	“文明的冲突”基本上是西方对抗世界其他部分，它本应描述世界的本来面目。
In reality, the West is vague enough to include a vast array of areas without describing their unifying characteristics.	在现实中，西方是含糊不清的，包括大量领域而并不确定其统一的特征。
So what exactly is West?	那么究竟为何西方呢？
What does Westernization mean?	西方化是什么？
Why is Japan considered Western and China not?	为何认为日本是西方而中国不是？
Where does Shanghai stand?	上海属于哪里？
Is Russia part of the West?	俄国是西方的一部分吗？
From these uncertainties, we can conclude that the West is not a geographic entity.	从这些不确定性中，我们可以得出结论说西方并非一个地理性的实体。
It probably first established itself as a mindset when the Greeks, 25 centuries ago, perceived themselves as Western versus the Oriental Persians.	希腊人在2500年以前把他们自己视为是与东方波斯人对立的西方。 大概在那个时候西方作为一种心态而建立起来。
Since the West has lost any clear territorial basis since then, the phrase “the West” has become a universal not a local notion.	由于西方从那时以来已经失去了明确的领土范围 ， “ 西方”一词已经成为普世而非地域概念。
To be Western or Westernized, above all, is a mindset which does not coincide with any continent, nor with any specific nation or religion.	是否西方首先是一种心态，而这一心态并不与任何大陆吻合，也并不与任何具体国家或地区吻合。
Huntington’s mistake, it seems, was to contain the West inside national borders: there is no map of the West.	亨廷顿的错误好像在于把西方局限在国家边界之内，而西方并没有边界。
No map can work when some Asian nations are Western (Japan, Taiwan), when non-Western groups (Muslims in Europe) live in supposedly Western countries, when some Eastern countries are partially Westernized and some Western countries (Russia) are not fully Westernized. Eventually it looks easier to define the mental borders of the West than its territorial borders.	某些亚洲国家(日本和台湾)属于西方，非西方人群(欧洲的穆斯林)生活在本应属于西方的国家，某些东欧国家部分被西方化而某些西方国家(俄国)并没有完全西方化。 在这些情况下，地图是无济于事的。
	最终，确定西方的心理边界要比确定领土边界好像更为容易一些。
I believe that the West is a mindset defined by three fundamental traits that cannot easily be found in the so-called Eastern civilizations: a passion for innovation, a capacity for self-criticism, and gender equality.	我相信西方是一个由三个基本特征确定的心态，在东方文明中不大容易找到这种心态。 这些特征是对创新的热情、自我批评的能力以及性别平等。
‘What is new?’ -- a personal greeting since the Hellenistic age – captures the essence of the Western mind.	从古希腊时代以来人们的问候语就是“有什么新消息吗 ” 。 这一句话总结了西方心态的要害。
The non-Westerner, however, would rather place tradition above innovation.	但是非西方人更加愿意把传统置于创新之上。
But innovation as a fundamental value explains the scientific breakthroughs of the West versus the East. It explains unavoidable conflicts with conservative non-Western societies and it also explains what we should call ‘the Westernization of the West.’	但是创新作为一种基本价值观可以解释与东方相比西方取得了科学突破。 它也说明西方与传统非西方社会不可避免的冲突，同时也说明了我们应该称作的“西方的西方化 ” 。
The West keeps destroying its own traditions, including its religions. The economist Joseph Schumpeter defined this process as one of “creative destruction.”	西方不断破坏自身的传统，包括其宗教。 经济学家熊彼德把这一过程成为“创造性破坏 ” 。
The term could be applied to all walks of life in the West.	这一名词可以适用于西方所有阶层。 西方保守派在创造性破坏上并不比西方自由派差劲。
Western conservatives are no less prone to creative destruction than Western liberals: conservatives, indeed, are well known for inventing traditions. Take the 19th century British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, who invented most of the supposedly ancient traditions around the British monarchy.	保守派实际上因创造传统而著名。 例如，十九世纪英国首相迪斯雷利就创造出了大多数本应该是有关英国君主制度悠久的传统。
Innovation in the West seems to be a never-ending, self-transforming process.	西方的创新好像是一个没有尽头、自我转变的进程。
Self-criticism, even more than innovation, is a defining characteristic of the West.	自我批评与创新相比更加能够确定西方的特征。
In most if not all non-Western civilizations, pride and self love exclude self-criticism or at least the criticism of one’s civilization as such.	非西方文明中面子和自恋排除了自我批评，至少不会自我批评自身的文化。
A true Muslim or Chinese scholar cannot be defined as a true Chinese or a true Muslim by being critical of his own world.	一个真正的穆斯林或者中国学者由于对自身文化的批评而难以被称为一个真正的中国人或者穆斯林。
Not so in the West.	西方就不是如此。
The Western scholar remains perfectly legitimate when putting to death Western values: there is no Chinese or Muslim Nietzsche claiming that his own God is dead.	西方学者宣布西方价值观死亡完全正当，而中国或者穆斯林世界中就没有向尼采那样的人说他自己的上帝已经死了。
Is there a Chinese or a Muslim Montaigne ready to write that the “Indian savages” may be wiser than us, as Montaigne did in 16th century France?	中国或者穆斯林世界中有没有人像16世纪法国的蒙田那样那样说“印第安野人”或许比我们更加明智呢？
Of course there must be some Chinese or Muslim Montaigne or Nietzsche, but they would not be considered beacons of their civilizations.	当然肯定会有像蒙田或者尼采那样的中国人或者穆斯林，但是他们不会被视为自身文明的灯塔。
Self-criticism, not self-love, and cultural relativism are the nuts and bolts of the Western mindset.	自我批评而非自恋以及文化相对主义是西方心态的根基。
The same goes with gender equality.	在性别平等上也是如此。
This has not always been so. In the ancient Greek, Jewish, and Christian religions, women were perceived as inferior to men.	情况并不总是这样。 在古希腊、犹太和基督教地区，妇女被视为低人一等。
But this notion has been contentious in the West for centuries. Nowadays, gender equality has become the norm.	但是很多世纪以来这一观点一直引发争议。 如今，性别平等已经成为通例。
This is not the case in most non-Western civilizations.	在非西方文明中并非如此。
Some would argue that gender equality is a consequence of the modernization process, not of Westernization.	有人会说性别平等是现代化进程的结果，而非西方化的结果。
This may be true, but the status of women is clearly one issue that puts non-Western Muslims into opposition to the West.	这种说法不无道理，但是妇女的地位问题明显把非西方的穆斯林与西方世界对立起来。
If we accept the above definition of the West as a mindset, this leaves open three major questions: can the East be modernized without being Westernized?	如果我们接受以上西方作为一种心态的定义就会带来三个大问题。 它们是：东方在不被西化的情况下能否现代化？
Where do we draw the line between West and East?	我们如何区分东方和西方？
Will the West remain Western?	西方世界会保持西方吗？
So far, there is no case in history of non-Western modernization; the discourse on Asian values, initially started in Singapore, is basically a political discourse.	目前为止，历史上还没有非西方的现代化。 有关亚洲价值观的讨论最初起源于新加坡，这基本上是一个政治性讨论。
It is after retooling their mindset towards innovation and self-criticism that Asian countries have become modern.	亚洲国家只是在把它们的心态转向了创新以及自我批评之后才变得现代化。
This does not make them less Asian.	这并不让这些国家不那么亚洲化。
Contemporary Koreans or Japanese remain fully Korean or Japanese but are closer to a Westerner than they would be to their own ancestors.	当代的韩国人和日本人还依旧完全是韩国人和日本人但是要比祖先相比更加靠近西方。
Similarly, a modern Egyptian or a modern Saudi will be more on par with a French or an American than they would be with an ancient Arab.	同样，现代埃及人或者沙特人比古代阿拉伯人更加接近法国人或者美国人。
Does this Westernization make the Egyptian or the Saudi less authentic Arabs?	这一西方化是否让埃及人或者沙特人不再是正宗的阿拉伯人呢？
Such a debate does take place within all Eastern societies, which leads us to the real clash of civilizations: all societies today are fragmented between Westernizers and non-Westernizers.	所有的东方社会都存在这一辩论，从而把我们带到了真正的文明冲突，也就是当今所有社会都分裂为西方化人士和非西方化人士。
This clash within civilizations on what modernization means is more significant than Huntington’s alleged conflict between geographical entities.	这一文明内部有关现代化含义的冲突要比亨廷顿所谓的地理实体之间的冲突更加显著。
The controversy on the essential meaning of modernization, also known as an identity crisis, does impact Western countries as well.	有关现代化基本含义的争议也被称作身份认同危机同样也影响到西方国家。
Vast groups who live in the West, Western and non-Western fundamentalists, fight the unending Westernization process in the name of tradition.	生活在西方的大量西方和非西方原教旨主义者以传统的名义与西方化进程进行永无休止的斗争。
Many would like to stop the engine by using various guises like ecology or identity, but a Western society where you could not start your day by asking ‘What's new?’ would not be Western any more.	许多人想要通过使用生态或者身份认同的伪装来停止熄火，但是如果你早上第一句话不是“有没有新消息”的话，西方社会也就不再是西方了。
	
What Lies Ahead in 2011?	2011年将迎来什么？
NEW YORK – The global economy ends 2010 more divided than it was at the beginning of the year.	发自纽约 — — 相对于2010年初，今年年末的全球经济更为分化。
On one side, emerging-market countries like India, China, and the Southeast Asian economies, are experiencing robust growth.	一方面，印度，中国这样的新兴市场国家以及东南亚经济体都在蓬勃增长。
On the other side, Europe and the United States face stagnation – indeed, a Japanese-style malaise – and stubbornly high unemployment.	而另一方面，欧美却面临着滞胀（其实就是一种日本式的经济萎靡）以及挥之不去的高失业率。
The problem in the advanced countries is not a jobless recovery, but an anemic recovery – or worse, the possibility of a double-dip recession.	发达国家当前的问题并不是一场缺乏就业的复苏，而是一场贫血的复苏 — — 或者再更悲观地说：一种二次衰退的可能性。
This two-track world poses some unusual risks. While Asia’s economic output is too small to pull up growth in the rest of the world, it may be enough to push up commodity prices.	这一两极发展的状况也因此引发了某些特殊风险：虽然亚洲经济尚不足以带动世界其他地区的增长，但在推高商品价格方面却已绰绰有余了。
Meanwhile, US efforts to stimulate its economy through the Federal Reserve’s policy of “quantitative easing” may backfire.	与此同时，美国试图通过美联储的“量化宽松”政策来刺激国内经济的做法可能会弄巧反拙。
After all, in globalized financial markets, money looks for the best prospects around the world, and these prospects are in Asia, not the US. So the money won’t go where it’s needed, and much of it will wind up where it’s not wanted – causing further increases in asset and commodity prices, especially in emerging markets.	毕竟在全球金融市场中资金总是向那些最繁荣的地区流动，而这些区域目前是在亚洲而不是美国。 因此资金是不会向那些急需它的地方流动的，而是涌向那些不需要它的地方 — — 这会导致资产和商品价格进一步升值，在新兴市场尤甚。
Given the high levels of excess capacity and unemployment in Europe and America, quantitative easing is unlikely to trigger a bout of inflation.	考虑到欧美地区巨量的过剩产能以及极高的失业率，量化宽松政策不太可能引发通胀。
It could, however, increase anxieties about future inflation, leading to higher long-term interest rates – precisely the opposite of the Fed’s goal.	但它会增加人们对未来通胀的忧虑，导致长期利率进一步升高 — — 这与美联储的愿望恰好倒了过来。
This is not the only, or even the most important, downside risk facing the global economy.	而这并不是世界经济所面对的唯一或是最重要的危机。
The gravest threat comes from the wave of austerity sweeping the world, as governments, particularly in Europe, confront the large deficits brought on by the Great Recession, and as anxieties about some countries’ ability to meet their debt payments contributes to financial-market instability.	最严重的威胁来自于席卷全球的紧缩浪潮，这是因为以欧洲国家为首的各国政府都面对着大萧条所带来的巨额赤字，而对某些国家还债能力的忧虑则导致了金融市场的不稳定。
The outcome of premature fiscal consolidation is all but foretold: growth will slow, tax revenues will diminish, and the reduction in deficits will be disappointing.	对这种不成熟的财政巩固措施所导致的结果其实已经早有预言：增长将放缓，税收将减少，而赤字削减的效果却不如人意。
And, in our globally integrated world, the slowdown in Europe will exacerbate the slowdown in the US, and vice versa.	同时在我们这个一体化的世界上，欧洲经济的放缓将加剧美国经济的下滑，反之亦然。
With the US able to borrow at record-low interest rates, and with the promise of high returns on public investments after a decade of neglect, it is clear what it should do.	随着将贷款利率降低到历史最低水平，以及在十年的迷失之后重拾对公共投资的高回报承诺，美国终于知道了自己应当如何做为。
A large-scale public-investment program would stimulate employment in the short term, and growth in the long term, leading in the end to a lower national debt.	一个大规模的公共投资计划应能在短期内刺激就业，并推动长期增长，最终减低国家债务水平。
But financial markets demonstrated their shortsightedness in the years preceding the crisis, and are doing so once again, by applying pressure for spending cuts, even if that implies reducing badly needed public investments.	但金融市场不但在危机袭来的前几年暴露了自己的短视，如今又再次重蹈覆辙，逼迫政府削减支出，而这则意味着急需的公共投资将大幅减少。
Moreover, political gridlock will ensure that little is done about the other festering problems confronting the American economy: mortgage foreclosures are likely to continue unabated (legal complications aside); small and medium-sized enterprises are likely to continue to be starved of funds; and the small and medium-sized banks that traditionally provide them with credit are likely to continue to struggle to survive.	此外，政治僵局也将导致美国政府在另一个不断恶化的经济难题上难有作为：抵押贷款赎回权取消（mortgage foreclosures，意指贷款人因无法偿还而被银行收回房产）的风潮将愈演愈烈（先不管其同时引发的法律纠纷 ） ， 中小企业依旧无法得到贷款，而那些往常贷款给他们的中小型银行则将继续挣扎在死亡线上。
In Europe, meanwhile, matters are unlikely to be any better.	与此同时，欧洲的状况也没有转好的迹象。
Europe has finally managed to come to the rescue of Greece and Ireland. In the run up to the crisis, both were governed by right-wing governments marked by crony capitalism or worse, demonstrating once again that free-market economics didn’t work in Europe any better than it did in the US.	欧洲最终出手拯救的两个国家 — — 希腊和爱尔兰 — — 都是在一个与大资本勾肩搭背的右翼政府领导下滑向危机的，这再一次证明了自由市场理论不但在美国一败涂地，在欧洲也行不通。
In Greece, as in the US, a new government was left to clean up the mess.	与美国类似，希腊组建了一个新政府来收拾这个烂摊子。
The Irish government that encouraged reckless bank lending and the creation of a property bubble was, perhaps not surprisingly, no more adept in managing the economy after the crisis that it was before.	而爱尔兰那个鼓励银行滥发贷款并制造了地产泡沫的政府则在危机之后现出了不懂管理经济的原形。
Politics aside, property bubbles leave in their wake a legacy of debt and excess capacity in real estate that is not easily rectified – especially when politically connected banks resist restructuring mortgages.	抛开政治因素不谈，地产泡沫给爱尔兰政府留下了一大堆债务和一个产能过剩的房地产行业，而这些东西是不那么容易被消除的 — — 尤其是当那些在政治上抱团的银行拒绝进行抵押贷款重组的时候。
To me, attempting to discern the economic prospects for 2011 is not a particularly interesting question: the answer is bleak, with little upside potential and a lot of downside risk.	对于我本人来说，预测2011年的经济并不是个特别有趣的问题：答案必定是黯淡的，既难寻上升之潜力，又充斥着下滑的风险。
More importantly, how long will it take Europe and America to recover, and can Asia’s seemingly export-dependent economies continue to grow if their historical markets languish?	更重要的是，欧美究竟要花费多少时间才能复苏，而当这些传统出口目的地一蹶不振之时，亚洲的出口导向型经济又能增长多久？
My best bet is that these countries will maintain rapid growth as they shift their economic focus to their vast and untapped domestic markets.	我的最佳方案是这些亚洲国家都将重点转向庞大且尚未开发的国内市场，并以此维持快速增长。
This will require considerable restructuring of their economies, but China and India are both dynamic, and proved their resilience in their response to the Great Recession.	这需要他们对本国的经济结构进行重大改革，但中印两国都充满活力，使之在面对这场大萧条时拥有更大的回旋余地。
I am not so bullish on Europe and America.	我对欧美的前景都不太乐观。
In both cases, the underlying problem is insufficient aggregate demand.	他们所面临的根本问题其实就是累计总需求不足。
The ultimate irony is that there are simultaneously excess capacity and vast unmet needs – and policies that could restore growth by using the former to address the latter.	而最大的讽刺莫过于一方面产能过剩，另一方面却有巨大的需求无法的到满足 — — 而利用前者来应对后者的政策对恢复增长是有帮助的。
Both the US and Europe, for instance, must retrofit their economies to address the challenges of global warming. There are feasible policies that would work within long-term budget constraints.	比如说，欧美两地都必须对自身经济进行革新以应对全球变暖的挑战，即便处于长期的预算限制之下，还是有可行的政策可供施展的。
The problem is politics: in the US, the Republican Party would rather see President Barack Obama fail than the economy succeed.	问题还是出在政治上，在美国，共和党宁愿不要经济振兴也要看着奥巴马出丑。
In Europe, 27 countries with different interests and perspectives are pulling in different directions, without enough solidarity to compensate.	在欧洲，27个国家都有着不同的利益诉求和观点，危机之下各自突围，连足够的凝聚力都没有。
The bailout packages are, in this light, impressive achievements.	由此看来，那个紧急援助计划的出台已经是很了不起的成就了。
In both Europe and America, the free-market ideology that allowed asset bubbles to grow unfettered – markets always know best, so government must not intervene – now ties policymakers’ hands in designing effective responses to the crisis.	无论是在欧洲还是美国，纵容资产泡沫任意疯长的自由市场理念 — — 所谓市场万能，政府切勿干预 — — 如今变成了套在政策制定者身上的枷锁，使之无法制定有效的危机应对策略。
One might have thought that the crisis itself would undermine confidence in that ideology.	有人会觉得危机本身的出现将动摇这一理念的公信力。
Instead, it has resurfaced to drag governments and economies down the sinkhole of austerity.	但事实上，它却重新得势，又把各国政府和经济体拖入了紧缩的泥潭。
If politics is the problem in Europe and America, only political changes are likely to restore them to growth.	如果欧美的问题是政治，那只有政治变革才能使它们重新走上增长之路。
Or else they can wait until the overhang of excess capacity diminishes, capital goods become obsolete, and the economy’s internal restorative forces work their gradual magic.	或者它们可以选择等到过度产能减少，资本货物被抛弃，经济内部的恢复性力量逐渐滋长的那一刻。
Either way, victory is not around the corner.	但无论选择哪一条道路，胜利都不会立刻到来。
	
India’s Outrage	印度之怒
NEW DELHI – Last year ended for India on a note of public outrage that has burdened the country with anger, frustration, and pessimism.	新德里—印度的去年以公共愤怒收尾。 这场愤怒让印度背上了怨气、沮丧和悲观。
The cause, as all the world knows, was the fatally brutal rape of a young woman on a moving bus, after which she and her male companion – himself beaten nearly to death – were thrown, naked, into the street on a freezing night.	其原因早已全世界皆知 — — 一名女性在公交车上被野蛮的强奸夺取了生命，和她在一起的男伴也遭到了几乎致命的殴打，在寒冷的夜晚被剥光了衣物扔下街头。
The savagery and wanton cruelty of the attack shocked the country to its core.	这一轻薄而野蛮的袭击恶行震入了印度的骨髓。
But there is more behind the spontaneous protests that have choked the great central vistas of Delhi (to such an extent that the government was forced to change the venue for meetings with visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin).	但在万人空巷的德里自发游行背后，有很多东西值得我们反思（游行达到了什么样的规模呢？ 政府被迫改变与来访的俄罗斯总统普京举行会晤的地点。
	）
The anger that has poured onto the streets of Delhi and many other Indian cities was fueled by a great accumulated discontent – at the bestial rape and murder of that still-unnamed woman, yes, but also at pervasive public and private corruption, the absence of governance and accountability, and much more.	在德里和其他许多印度城市街头挥洒的愤怒的背后是极深的积怨 — — 不仅是对这位不知名女性所遭受的强奸和杀害的愤怒，也包括对无处不在的公私腐败、治理和问责的缺乏以及其他诸多问题的愤怒。
Years of pent-up rage are now flowing out.	多年的积怨如今终于爆发。
Of course, the government deserves – and has received – no quarter.	当然，政府不值得原谅，也没人原谅它。
The government failed to prevent the crime, then failed again when its unresponsive, inefficient, and crooked police force was unable to respond appropriately.	政府没能预防犯罪在先，犯罪发生后，在腐败低效的警方没能恰当响应的情况下，政府又没能拿出措施。
A wholly moribund and sclerotic administration simply did not know where its duty lay.	一个完全僵化、行将就木的政府根本不知道自己的责任在哪里。
When protests erupted, the government, in a fit of blind idiocy, set the police upon peaceful protesters, men and women, with long batons, water cannon, and tear gas.	游行爆发后，政府又像抽风一样把警察派向示威群众，用警棍、水枪和催泪弹对付走上街头的男男女女。
This heavy-handedness of course resolved nothing. Citizens’ fury deepened into grim resolve; the government’s repressive impulse was challenged and defeated.	如此笨拙的应对措施解决不了任何问题，群众的愤怒开始向暴行深化；政府的抑制措施根本无法阻挡。
Since then, tokenism has replaced leadership.	此后，装门面取代了领导力。
Not one government official had the courage, skill, or decency to rise to the occasion.	政府之中没有一位官员有勇气、能力和人格魅力出现在示威群众跟前。
The opposition, too, floundered, doing no more than simply faulting the ruling establishment.	反对派也在胡乱挣扎，除了大肆指责执政党外拿不出任何策略。
After an unconscionably long delay of seven days, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh finally broke his incomprehensible silence about the rape.	在经历了冷漠无情的七天后，总理辛格终于打破了令人费解的沉默。
But his public statement offered no answers and no balm – indeed, nothing but platitudes.	但他的公开讲话并不构成强奸案的答案，也起不了镇抚人心的作用 — — 事实上，这全是一番陈词滥调。
Then, humiliatingly, Singh inquired, sotto voce, of those surrounding him: “Was it all right?”	接着，辛格做了令人汗颜的动作：他轻声问随从说 ： “ 这么说对吗 ？ ”
A torrent of electronic wrath burst forth.	这在电子世界中掀起了怒波。
Protest placards could be seen all over the country: “No!	全国各大论坛随处可见示威标语 ： “ 不！
Prime Minister, it is not all right.”	总理，这么说不对 。 ”
Clearly, Machiavelli was correct: for a political leader, the people’s contempt is worse than their hatred.	显然，马基雅维利是对的：对政治领袖来说，人民的轻视比人民的愤怒更糟糕。
Then, in another mindless act, the victim, struggling for life, was flown to a hospital in Singapore.	接着，政府又干了一件蠢事，生命垂危的受害者被飞机送到了新加坡的医院。
No one would or could say why.	没人知道为什么要这样。
It was there that she died – some say that she arrived already brain-dead.	后来她死在了新加坡 — — 也有人说到达新加坡时她已经陷入了脑死亡。
Her body was then hurriedly flown back to India, where it was quietly, almost surreptitiously, cremated.	随后，她的遗体又被匆忙运回印度，悄悄地 — — 甚至可以说是偷偷地 — — 火化了。
If the government feared her alive, it was petrified of her dead.	如果说政府害怕她活着，那么她的死足以令政府恐惧。
All of India was shamed by this callous and inhuman folly.	全体印度人都因为这场野蛮残忍的蠢事而蒙羞。
As a result, India’s Congress-led government has irretrievably lost the public’s confidence; the establishment’s authority has evaporated.	结果，国大党领导的印度政府已经彻底失去了公众信心；执政者的权威已经蒸发殆尽。
A blunt question is now being asked frequently and openly: “Is this India’s Tahrir Square?”	如今，一个尖锐的问题被公开地频繁提及 ： “ 这会是印度的解放广场吗 ？ ”
Even if it is not, how can an internally roiled India respond adequately to its many external tests, the severity of which was underscored recently by Pakistani troops’ killing of two Indian soldiers along the Line of Control in Kashmir.	即使答案是否定的，内部阵脚已乱的印度如何充分地应对诸多外部考验，比如最近发生的巴基斯坦军方在克什米尔控制线附近杀害两名印度士兵的事件？
Meanwhile, as India flounders, Northeast Asia has been astir choosing new leaders, who have now been installed in China, Japan, and North and South Korea.	在印度苦苦挣扎的同时，东北亚 纷纷选出了新领导人，中国、日本、朝鲜和韩国都完成了权力交接。
With an assertive China, ongoing regime change in Myanmar, a troubled Bangladesh, a constitutionally stymied Nepal, and continuing ethnic tensions in Sri Lanka, India’s eastern challenges are many and mighty.	咄咄逼人的中国、体制转变方兴未艾的缅甸、麻烦重重的孟加拉国、宪政问题缠身的尼泊尔、种族冲突不断的斯里兰卡 — — 在印度的东面可谓强敌四伏，挑战重重。
But they are even more severe to India’s west, with Pakistan heading into elections (one hopes) in the spring of 2013, and NATO troops withdrawing from Afghanistan.	而西面的情况甚至更为严峻，巴基斯坦（有望）即将在2013年春迎来大选，北约将从阿富汗撤军。
Indian diplomacy faces a time of trial in both countries.	印度外交将同时面临这两个国家的考验。
Farther west, too, India’s statecraft is in question.	进一步向西看，印度的国基也存在问题。
Where does India, which remains dependent on Middle Eastern energy, stand on that region’s many crises?	仍需依赖中东能源的印度在中东诸多危机中立场如何？
How will it address the nuclear issue in Iran – a country with which it has close historical, cultural, and economic ties – or the civil war in Syria, the rise of Salafism in Egypt, and the Israel-Palestine standoff?	印度如何处理与之存在密切历史、文化和经济关系的伊朗的核问题，或是叙利亚内战问题、埃及沙拉菲主义崛起问题以及以巴冲突问题？
Moreover, India no longer appears to be the vigorous economic dynamo that was the darling of global investors only five years ago.	此外，印度已不再是强大的经济发动机，而五年前，它还是全球投资者梦想的地方。
Already some say that the “I” in BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) should now stand for Indonesia.	有人说，金砖国家（BRICS，巴西、俄罗斯、印度、中国和南非）中的“I”现在应该是印度尼西亚。
India is running high current-account and fiscal deficits; food-price inflation is in the double digits; and the rupee has weakened.	印度存在巨大的经常项目和财政赤字；食品价格通胀率高达两位数；卢比也在贬值。
As for trade with China, The Economist points out that “for every dollar’s worth of exports to China [principally raw materials], India imports three.”	至于与中国的俄贸易 ， 《 经济学人》指出“印度每向中国出口1美元（主要是原材料 ） ， 都要进口3美元 。 ”
Can outrage turn to catharsis?	愤怒���导致动乱吗？
Clearly, the current government is unable to bring about any of the necessary changes.	显然，现任政府拿不出任何必须的改变。
A possible answer lies in an early election: a new mandate for an India that is in desperate need of renewal.	可能的答案在于提前大选：渴望涅槃的印度需要一个新指挥官。
	
What McCain and Obama Ignore	麦凯恩和奥巴马无瑕顾及之处
PRINCETON – Barack Obama worked for three years as a community organizer on Chicago’s blighted South Side, so he knows all about the real poverty that exists in America.	普林斯顿 - - 奥巴马曾经在芝加哥破烂不堪的城南当过三年的社区组织者，所以他完全了解美国真实的贫困状况。
He knows that in one of the world’s richest nations, 37 million people live in poverty, a far higher proportion than in Europe’s wealthy nations.	他知道，在世界上最为富有的国家中有三千七百万人生活在贫困之中。 这一比例要远远高于欧洲富国。
Yet Obama’s campaigning has focused on “Main Street” and tax cuts for the middle class, bypassing the issue of what to do about poverty.	但是奥巴马竞选集中谈论的是大众百姓以及中产阶级减税，却忽略了如何应对贫困。
It’s not as if Obama has no policies for helping the poor.	这并非是奥巴马没有扶贫规划。
Go to his Web site, click on “The Issues” and then on “Poverty.”	到他的网站上，点击“议题 ” ， 然后再点击“贫困 ” 。
There you will find a set of thoughtful proposals ranging from raising the minimum wage to establishing model “Promise Neighborhoods” that will attempt to turn around areas with high levels of poverty and low levels of educational achievement by providing services such as early childhood education and crime prevention.	在那里你可以找到一整套规划，内容遍及提高最低工资到建立模范“保证邻里”项目等。 这些都试图通过提供类似早期幼儿教育以及阻止犯罪等服务项目来整治高贫困以及低教育地区。
(Go to John McCain’s Web site, and you won’t even find “poverty” among the list of issues to click on – although “Space Program” is there.)	(你到麦凯恩的网站上就找不到“贫困”议题可以点击，然而“空间计划”却赫然在目。 )
So why isn’t Obama speaking up about an issue on which he has so much more first-hand experience than his opponent, and better policies, too?	在贫困问题上，奥巴马比麦凯恩更有切身体会和更好的政策。 那么，为何奥巴马没有大声疾呼呢？
Perhaps not enough of the poor vote, or they will vote Democratic anyway.	也许是因为贫困人口选票不够多，或者是因为反正他们会投票给民主党。
Moreover, his researchers presumably have told him that independent middle-class voters are more likely to be won over by appeals to their wallets than to concern for America’s poor.	而且，他的研究人员据说告诉他，收入问题要比关心美国的贫困人口更会赢得独立中产选民的支持。
If America’s poor don’t rank high among voters’ concerns, it is no surprise that the poor abroad are virtually invisible.	如果贫困问题并非为选民关注，那么，外国的贫困问题几乎视而不见也就不足为奇了。
Again, Obama has both the background – with his family ties to Kenya – and a promising policy, to increase America’s foreign assistance to $50 billion by 2012, using the money to stabilize failing states and bring sustainable growth to Africa.	同样，奥巴马家族与肯尼亚有渊源，他也就有这一问题的背景，他也有令人鼓舞的规划。 他的规划就是到2012年把美国的对外援助增加到五百亿美元，用这笔钱来稳定摇摇欲坠的国家并且带给非洲可持续增长。
(Currently, of all the OECD donor nations, only Greece gives a lower percentage of its gross national income than the United States does.)	(目前，在所有经合组织成员中，只有希腊的外援占国民总收入的比例比美国的低。 )
But when Obama’s running mate, Joe Biden, was asked, in his debate with his Republican counterpart, Sarah Palin, what proposals an Obama-Biden administration might have to scale back as a result of the $700 billion Wall Street bailout, the only specific proposal he mentioned was the increase in foreign assistance.	但是，奥巴马的竞选搭档拜登在与共和党副总统候选人佩林的电视辩论中被问到奥巴马和拜登政府如何削减开支来应付七千亿美元的华尔街救市计划时，他提到的唯一具体建议就是增加外援。
McCain has never gotten down to specifics about how much foreign aid he would like the US to give.	在美国给予多少外援时，麦凯恩从来都是语焉不详。
Both candidates refer to deaths of American military personnel in Iraq, but there has been less attention to the war’s civilian causalities.	两个候选人都谈到了在伊拉克的美军阵亡，但是对于战争中的平民死亡却较少谈论。
In her debate with Biden, Palin actually attacked Obama for saying that, in her words, “All we’re doing in Afghanistan is air-raiding villages and killing civilians.”	在与拜登的辩论中，佩林攻击奥巴马的言论，用她的话来说就是“我们在阿富汗所做的一切就是空袭村庄以及杀害平民 ” 。
She called that comment “reckless” and “untrue,” because, “That’s not what we’re doing there.	她称这一言论“鲁莽”以及“不真实 ” ， 因为 ， “ 那不是我们在那里干的事。
We’re fighting terrorists, and we’re securing democracy.”	我们在与恐怖分子作战，而且我们在保护民主 ” 。
Of course, killing civilians is not all that the US and its NATO allies are doing in Afghanistan, and if Obama implied that it was, his rhetoric was careless.	当然，杀害平民并非美国及其北约盟国在阿富汗所从事的所有事情。 而且如果奥巴马暗示那就是他们的所作所为，那么他的言论就是没有头脑。
But what is extraordinary about Palin’s comment is that, despite being a strong proponent of the sanctity of human life, in criticizing Obama she did not pause to deplore the serious loss of innocent human life that American air strikes in Afghanistan have caused.	但是佩林评论的惊人之处在于，尽管她强烈支持人命不可侵犯，但是在批评奥巴马的时候她并没有停下来哀悼美国空袭在阿富汗造成的巨大平民死亡。
Afghanistan’s president, Hamid Karzai, has repeatedly expressed outrage at American air strikes that have killed civilians – most recently in August, when he said that 95 Afghans, including 50 children, were killed in the bombing of a village.	阿富汗总统卡尔扎伊多次对美军空袭造成平民死亡表示愤怒。 最近的一次发生在八月，95名阿富汗人，包括五十名儿童在空袭村庄中死亡。
The global ethical challenge that has been most prominent in the campaign is climate change.	竞选中最为主要的全球性伦理问��是气候变化问题。
Here, the candidates’ goals are virtually identical: they both support a cap-and-trade system to make deep cuts in US greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050.	在这一问题上，候选人的目标几乎是一致的。 他们都支持限额-交易机制，从而到2050年大幅度削减美国的温室气体排放。
Obama wants the goal to be an 80% reduction and McCain says 66%, but, since the next president will leave office no later than 2016, that difference is irrelevant.	奥巴马想要削减80 % ， 麦凯恩则为66 % 。 但是，由于下一任总统最晚也要在2016年离任，所以，这一区别也就微不足道了。
Interestingly, one ethical issue on which neither candidate has campaigned has been shown to have the potential to move voters.	有趣的是，有一个两党候选人在竞选中都还没有涉及到的一个伦理问题却有可能会打动选民。
A group called Defenders of Wildlife has been running an ad graphically highlighting Palin’s support for shooting wolves from aircraft.	一个名为野生动物守护者的团体投放了一则广告，用图表的方式突出表现了佩林支持从飞机上射杀狼。
A study of Republicans, Democrats, and independents showed that viewing the ad led to greater support for Obama.	一项对共和党、民主党以及独立党派的研究显示看过这则广告的人大部分会转而支持奥巴马。
According to Glenn Kessler, the head of HCD research, which conducted the study with the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion, whereas recent ads from both parties have had little impact among voters, “This is the first ad in over a month that seems to have broken through.”	与穆伦堡学院民意研究所共同进行该项研究的HCD研究的主管Glenn Kessler指出。 尽管两党候选人最近投放的广告在选民中很少产生影响 ， “ 这是一个月来第一个似乎打动选民的广告 。 ”
Consistent with that finding, an historic ballot initiative in California to ban cruel forms of animal confinement on factory farms, including the battery cage system of keeping hens, is also showing strong support.	与这项发现相符的是，在历史上加利福尼亚对制止工厂化农场囚禁动物的残酷方式，包括笼养鸡只的系统进行的投票表决也获得了相当高的支持率。
	
What Monetary Policy Does China Need?	中国需要何种货币政策？
China’s remarkable growth has been financed recently by a rapid expansion of money and bank credit that is producing an increasingly unsustainable investment boom.	最近，中国货币和银行信贷的快速扩张为其引人注目的经济增长提供了资金，而这正在产生一个愈发难以持久的投资激增。
This renews concerns that the country may not be able to avert a replay of the painful boom–and-bust cycle such as the one it endured in the mid-1990’s.	这重新引发人们的担忧，那就是中国可能无法避免重演其在九十年代中期所经历的痛苦的经济繁荣破灭循环。
Monetary policy is usually the first line of defense in such situations.	在这种情况下，货币政策往往是第一道防线。
But China’s monetary policy has been hamstrung by the tightly managed exchange-rate regime.	但是中国的货币政策却被严格管理的汇率体系所削弱。
This regime prevents the central bank – the People’s Bank of China (PBC) – from taking appropriate policy decisions to manage domestic demand, because interest-rate hikes could encourage capital inflows and put further pressure on the exchange rate.	这一体系阻止中央银行即中国人民银行作出适当的政策决定来管理国内需求，因为利率提升可能会鼓励资本流入并且进一步对汇率造成压力。
There is, of course, a vigorous ongoing debate about China’s exchange-rate policy.	当然，有关中国的汇率政策一直争论不休。
China’s rising trade surplus has led some observers to call for a revaluation of the renminbi to correct what they see as an unfair competitive advantage that China maintains in international markets.	中国上升的贸易顺差让某些观察家呼吁对人民币重新估价，以便修正他们所认为的中国在国际市场中维持的不公平的竞争优势。
Others argue that the stable exchange rate fosters macroeconomic stability in China.	其他人则提出，稳定的汇率促进中国的宏观经济稳定。
But this debate misses the point.	但是，这一论点不得要领。
What China really needs is a truly independent monetary policy oriented to domestic objectives.	中国需要的是切实独立的、面向国内目标的货币政策。
This would enable the PBC to manage domestic demand by allowing interest rates to rise in order to rein in credit growth and deter reckless investment.	这将会让人民银行通过允许利率上升来管理国内需求，从而限制信贷增长以及抑制盲目投资。
An independent monetary policy requires a flexible exchange rate, not a revaluation.	独立的货币政策要求灵活的汇率，而非重新估价。
But what could take the place of the stable exchange rate as an anchor for monetary policy and for tying down inflation expectations?	但是，什么东西可以取代作为货币政策以及压制通货膨胀预期的依靠的稳定汇率呢？
We recommend a low inflation objective as the anchor for monetary policy in China.	我们建议采用低通货膨胀目标作为中国货币政策的出发点。
Theoretical research and the practical experiences of many countries both show that focusing on price stability is the best way for monetary policy to achieve the broader objectives in the charter of the PBC: macroeconomic and financial stability, high employment growth, etc.	理论研究以及多国实际经验都表明，致力于价格稳定是货币政策实现人民银行职能中更为广泛的目标的最佳途径。 这些目标包括宏观经济和金融稳定以及高就业增长等等。
The low inflation objective need not involve the formalities of an inflation-targeting regime, such as that practiced by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, and is similar in approach to that recommended for the United States by US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke.	低通胀目标并不需要包括以通胀为指标的体系中的手段，欧洲央行和英格兰银行就采用这些手段，而且，美联储主席伯南特也建议美国采取类似的手段。
How could such a framework be operated effectively in an economy in which financial sector problems have weakened the monetary transmission mechanism?	中国金融体系问题已经削弱了货币转变机制，这样的一个框架如何在这种经济体中有效运作呢？
This is a key concern because, notwithstanding recent reforms, the banking system remains fragile.	这是一个关键性的顾虑，因为最低程度的金融体系改革应当足以落实低通胀目标。
Nevertheless, we believe that a minimal set of financial sector reforms – essentially making banks’ balance sheets strong enough to withstand substantial interest-rate policy actions – should suffice to implement a low inflation objective.	这些改革基本上可以将银行的资产负债表强化到足以抵御根本性的利率政策行动的程度。
Although full modernization of the financial sector is a long way off even in the best of circumstances, the minimal reforms that we recommend could strengthen the banking system sufficiently in the near term to support a more flexible exchange rate anchored by an inflation objective.	即使在最佳情况下实现金融体系的现代化还都是遥远的事情。 尽管如此，我们建议的最低程度的改革应当可以在近期内有力地加强银行体系，从而支持通胀目标所包含的更为灵活的汇率。
Indeed, price stability, and the broader macroeconomic stability emanating from it, would provide a good foundation for pushing forward with other financial sector reforms.	事实上，价格稳定，以及由此带来的更大程度的宏观经济稳定将会为推动金融体系的其他改革提供良好的基础。
The framework we suggest has the important benefit of continuity.	我们建议的框架具有连续性的重要益处。
The PBC would not have to change its operational approach to monetary policy.	人民银行将不必改变其针对货币政策的运作手段。
Only a shift in strategic focus would be needed to anchor monetary policy with a long-run target range for low inflation.	只需要改变战略关注点就可以在长期指标范围内为低通胀制定货币政策。
Monitoring of monetary (and credit) targets would still be important in achieving the inflation objective.	监控货币以及信贷指标在实现通胀目标上仍将十分重要。
Furthermore, it should be easier to adopt the new framework when times are good – like now, when growth is strong and inflation is low.	而且，时机妥当的时候采纳新的框架将会较为容易。 当前，增长强劲而通胀较低，正是好时机。
There is some risk that appreciation of the exchange rate if greater flexibility were allowed could precipitate deflation.	现在还有一种风险，那就是如果允许更大的灵活性会引起汇率上升从而加快通货紧缩。
What this really highlights, however, is the importance of framing the debate about exchange-rate flexibility in a broader context.	但是，这一情形实际上突出将汇率灵活性放在更大的范围内进行辩论的重要性。
Having an independent monetary policy that could counteract boom-and-bust cycles would be the best way for China to deal with such risks.	具有独立的、能够抵御从繁荣到破灭循环的货币政策是中国应付此类风险的最佳途径。
Contrary to those who regard the discussion of an alternative monetary framework as premature, there are good reasons for China to begin right now to build the institutional foundation for the transition to an independent monetary policy.	某些人认为现在讨论替换性的货币框架为时尚早。 与此相反，中国有很好的理由现在就为向独立的货币政策过渡建立机制性基础。
Indeed, early adoption of a low inflation objective would help secure the monetary and financial stability that China needs as it allows greater exchange-rate flexibility.	实际上，低通胀可以允许更大的汇率灵活度，尽早采纳这一目标将会帮助中国所需要的货币和金融稳定。
	
What Money Can Buy	金钱可以买什么
CHICAGO – In an interesting recent book, What Money Can’t Buy: The Moral Limits of the Market, the Harvard philosopher Michael Sandel points to the range of things that money can buy in modern societies and gently tries to stoke our outrage at the market’s growing dominance.	芝加哥—在迈克尔·桑德尔（Michael Sandel）颇有意思的新书《钱买不到的：市场的道德边界 》 （ What Money Can’t Buy: The Moral Limits of the Market）中，这位哈佛大学哲学家提到了许多在现代社会中可以用金钱买到的东西，然后优雅地煽风点火哦，激发我们对市场主宰一切的愤怒。
Is he right that we should be alarmed?	我们真的应该引起警惕吗？
While Sandel worries about the corrupting nature of some monetized transactions (do kids really develop a love of reading if they are bribed to read books?), he is also concerned about unequal access to money, which makes trades using money inherently unequal.	桑德尔担心某些货币化交易的腐败性质（真的可以用悬赏开发孩子的阅读兴趣吗？ ） ， 但他也担心金钱获得渠道的不平等性，因为这导致了用钱进行的贸易具有内在不平等性。
More generally, he fears that the expansion of anonymous monetary exchange erodes social cohesion, and argues for reducing money’s role in society.	更一般地讲，阿担心匿名货币交换的扩张会侵蚀社会凝聚力，并呼吁减弱金钱在社会中的作用。
Sandel’s concerns are not entirely new, but his examples are worth reflecting upon.	桑德尔的担忧算不上最新鲜，但他举的例子值得我们深思。
In the United States, some companies pay the unemployed to stand in line for free public tickets to congressional hearings.	在美国，一些公司花钱雇失业者排队抢过会听证的公共入场券。
They then sell the tickets to lobbyists and corporate lawyers who have a business interest in the hearing but are too busy to stand in line.	接着，他们把入场券卖给游说集团和公司律师 — — 听证对事关后两者的利益，但他们又太忙，没有时间排队。
Clearly, public hearings are an important element of participatory democracy.	显然，公共听证是参与性民主的重要元素。
All citizens should have equal access.	所有公民都应该有平等的参与权。
So selling access seems to be a perversion of democratic principles.	因此出售参与权似乎是对民主原则的滥用。
The fundamental problem, though, is scarcity.	但是，根本问题出在稀缺上。
We cannot accommodate everyone in the room who might have an interest in a particularly important hearing.	我们无法协调可能在某个重要听证上存在利益的所有人。
So we have to “sell” entry.	因此，我们不得不“出售”参与权。
We can either allow people to use their time (standing in line) to bid for seats, or we can auction seats for money.	我们可以让人们牺牲时间（排队）换取听证席位，也可以将听证权拿来拍卖换钱。
The former seems fairer, because all citizens seemingly start with equal endowments of time.	前者比较公平，因为似乎所有公民的初始时间禀赋都是一样的。
But is a single mother with a high-pressure job and three young children as equally endowed with spare time as a student on summer vacation?	但是，可以说一位从事高压力工作还带着三个幼儿的单身母亲的闲暇禀赋和一位放暑假的学生是一样的吗？
And is society better off if she, the chief legal counsel for a large corporation, spends much of her time standing in line?	而作为某大公司首席法律顾问的这位单身母亲花时间排队能产生让社会变得更好的效果吗？
Whether it is better to sell entry tickets for time or for money thus depends on what we hope to achieve.	用时间还是用金钱换取入场券孰优孰劣取决于我们希望达到的目的是什么。
If we want to increase society’s productive efficiency, people’s willingness to pay with money is a reasonable indicator of how much they will gain if they have access to the hearing.	如果我们希望增加社会生产率，那么人们愿意付多少钱可以作为合理的指标显示他们可以从参与听证中获得多少好处。
Auctioning seats for money makes sense – the lawyer contributes more to society by preparing briefs than by standing in line.	货币拍卖听证席位是有用的 — — 律师准备总结陈词对社会的贡献大于排队。
On the other hand, if it is important that young, impressionable citizens see how their democracy works, and that we build social solidarity by making corporate executives stand in line with jobless teenagers, it makes sense to force people to bid with their time and to make entry tickets non-transferable.	另一方面，如果重点在于让年轻、敏感的公民体验他们身处其中的民主是如何运转的，以及通过让公司高管与失业年轻人一起排队培养社会凝聚力，那么就应该迫使人们牺牲时间换取不可转移的入场券。
But if we think that both objectives – efficiency and solidarity – should play some role, perhaps we should turn a blind eye to hiring the unemployed to stand in line in lieu of busy lawyers, so long as they do not corner all of the seats.	但如果我们两个目标 — — 效率和凝聚力都应该起作用，也许我们应该对繁忙的律师雇用失业者替自己排队的现象睁一只眼闭一只眼，只要他们被霸占所有席位。
What about the sale of human organs, another example Sandel worries about?	那么贩卖人体器官又该怎么看呢？ 这是桑德尔所担心的又一件事。
Something seems wrong when a lung or a kidney is sold for money.	卖肾或者卖肺听起来似乎总有那么一丝不对劲。
Yet we celebrate the kindness of a stranger who donates a kidney to a young child.	但对于捐献肾脏给年轻小孩的陌生人，我们总要赞扬他的善良。
So, clearly, it is not the transfer of the organ that outrages us – we do not think that the donor is misinformed about the value of a kidney or is being fooled into parting with it.	因此，显然，是器官的交易激怒了我们 — — 我们并不会去想捐献者被误导了肾脏的价值，或是受骗上当才接受取肾的。
Nor, I think, do we have concerns about the scruples of the person selling the organ – after all, they are parting irreversibly with something that is dear to them for a price that few of us would accept.	而我认为，我们也不会去想出售器官者所经历的犹豫 — — 毕竟他们所经历的是与宝贵之物的不可逆的分离，而他们所获得的代价是很少有人愿意能够的。
I think part of our discomfort has to do with the circumstances in which the transaction takes place.	我想，我们的不满部分是来自交易发生的环境。
What kind of society do we live in if people have to sell their organs to survive?	如果一个人得出售器官才活得下去，那么我们生活在其中的是怎样一个社会啊！
But, while a ban on organ sales may make us feel better, does it really make society better off?	但是，尽管禁止贩卖器官会让我们感觉好受些，这真的能让社会变得更好吗？
Possibly, if it makes society work harder to ensure that people are never driven to the circumstances that would make them contemplate selling a vital organ.	也许是，如果这能让社会变得更努力从而确保人们永远不会陷入被诱出售活体器官的境况中去的话。
But possibly not, if it allows society to ignore the underlying problem, either moving the trade underground, or forcing people in such circumstances to resort to worse remedies.	但也可能不是，如果社会并没有意识到基本问题，而是将器官贩卖行为转入地下并迫使出售器官者得不到更好医疗的话。
Then again, part of our unease probably has to do with what we perceive as an unequal exchange.	再一次，我们的不安可能部分来自我们对不公平交换的定义。
The seller is giving up part of her body in an irreversible transaction.	出售者在一次不可逆的交易中放弃了身体的一部分。
The buyer is giving up only money – perhaps earned on a lucky stock trade or at an overpaid job.	购买者只放弃了金钱 — — 这笔钱可能来自某次撞大运的炒股或薪酬过高的工作。
If that money had been earned by selling a portion of a lung, or represented savings painfully accumulated during years of backbreaking work, we might consider the exchange more equal.	如果这笔钱本身便来自出售一部分肺脏，或是多年来辛勤劳作、一分一厘苦苦储蓄而得，我们或许会觉得这样的交换会公平些。
Of course, the central virtue of money is precisely its anonymity.	当然，钱最核心的优点正在于其匿名性。
I need know nothing about the dollar bill I receive to be able to use it.	我不需要知道拿到的美元钞票的相关信息就可以使用它。
But, because money’s anonymity obscures its provenance, it may be socially less acceptable as a medium of payment for some objects.	但是，匿名性使得我们无从考证钱的来源，而对于某些目标，这会导致人们对钱作为支付中介的角色难以接受。
In both examples – congressional tickets and organ sales – Sandel suggests reducing money’s role.	在上述两例中 — — 国会入场券和贩卖器官 — — 桑德尔都建议减弱钱的作用。
But money has many virtues in facilitating transactions – hence its ubiquitous use.	但钱在促进交易和使用范围方面有着大量好处。
So, perhaps the more important message is that society’s tolerance for monetization is proportional to the legitimacy accorded to the distribution of money.	因此，也许更重要的问题在于社会对货币化的容忍度与源自金钱分配的合理性成正比。
The more people believe that it is the hardworking and the deserving who have money, the more they are willing to tolerate transactions for money (though some transactions remain beyond the pale).	人们越是认为多劳多能者才能多得，就越是愿意忍受金钱交易（尽管仍有某些交易超出了仍受界限 ） 。
But if people believe that the moneyed are primarily those who are well connected or crooked, their tolerance for monetary transactions falls.	但如果人们认为关系最多、人品最劣者往往最能致富，那么他们对货币交易的容忍度也会下降。
Rather than focusing on prohibiting monetary transactions, perhaps a more important lesson imparted by Sandel’s examples is that we should work continuously to improve the perceived legitimacy of money’s distribution.	不要将注意力放在禁止货币交易上。 也许桑德尔的例子给我们的更重要的教训是我们应该不断改善对金钱分配的合理性的感觉。
	
The Moral Limits of Markets	市场的道德局限性
TOKYO – Today, there are very few things that money can’t buy.	发自东京 — — 在今天这个社会，不能用钱来换取的东西已经少之又少了。
If you are sentenced to a jail term in Santa Barbara, California, and don’t like the standard accommodations, you can buy a prison-cell upgrade for about $90 per night.	如果你在美国加利福尼亚州的圣塔芭芭拉市被判入狱，却又不喜欢跟普通囚犯一样的监狱环境，那么只需支付90美元/天就可以享受升级版的监仓。
If you want to help to prevent the tragic fact that, each year, thousands of babies are born to drug-addicted mothers, you can contribute to a charity that uses a market mechanism to ameliorate the problem: a $300 cash grant to any drug-addicted woman willing to be sterilized.	如果你不忍看见每年有数千名婴儿由吸毒妇女生下的悲惨事实，就可以捐款给一个利用市场机制来缓解这一状况的慈善组织：他们向每个愿意接受绝育的吸毒妇女支付300美元。
Or, if you want to attend a US Congressional hearing, but don’t want to wait for hours in line, you can enlist the services of a line-standing company.	又或者，你希望旁听一场国会听证，却不愿花费几个小时排队轮候入场券。 那么你可以找一家排队公司。
The company hires homeless people and others in need of work to wait in line – overnight if necessary.	这些公司雇佣那些无家可归或者其他需要工作的人去排队 — — 有必要的时候甚至可以通宵。
Just before the hearing begins, the paying customer can take his or her line-stander’s place in the queue, and claim a front-row seat in the hearing room.	等到听证会就快开始之前，付了钱的顾客就可以和排队者交换个位置，并因此在听证厅里占据一个前排的座位。
Is there anything wrong with buying and selling these things?	买卖这些东西有什么不对的吗？
Some would say no; people should be free to spend their money to buy whatever someone else is willing to sell.	有些人说没问题；人们应当有自由去花钱购买别人愿意出售的一切东西。
Others believe that there are some things that money should not be able to buy.	其他人则相信有些东西是不应该被投入金钱交易的。
But why? What exactly is wrong with selling prison-cell upgrades to those who can afford them, or offering cash for sterilization, or hiring line-standers?	但这是为什么？ 购买升级监仓，给绝育吸毒妇女送钱或者雇佣排队者究竟有什么错呢？
To answer questions such as these, we need to pose a bigger question: What role should money and markets play in a good society?	要解答这类问题，我们需要提出一个更宏大的问题：在一个好的社会里金钱和市场究竟应该扮演一个什么角色？
Asking this question, and debating it politically, is more important than ever.	询问这一问题并在政治上进行讨论的重要性已经变得前所未有的紧迫。
The last three decades have witnessed a quiet revolution, as markets and market-oriented thinking have reached into spheres of life previously governed by non-market values: family life and personal relations; health and education; environmental protection and criminal justice; national security and civic life.	过去30年我们见证了一场平静的革命，市场和以市场为导向的思维已经延伸到了那些原本被非市场价值观所主宰的生活领域：家庭生活和私人关系，健康和教育；环境保护和刑事司法；国家安全和公民生活
Almost without realizing it, we have drifted from having market economies to becoming market societies.	几乎在无意识的情况下，我们从拥有市场经济漂流到了逐渐成为市场社会。
The difference is this: A market economy is a tool – a valuable and effective tool – for organizing productive activity.	不同之处在于：市场经济组织生产活动的一种 — — 有价值且富有成效的 — — 工具。
A market society, by contrast, is a place where almost everything is up for sale.	而相比之下市场社会则是一个几乎所有东西都可以用来出售的地方。
It is a way of life in which market values seep into social relations and govern every domain.	这是一种市场价值观渗入社会关系并主宰每一个领域的生活方式。
We should be worried about this trend for two reasons.	我们应当为此而感到忧虑，原因有二：首先，随着金钱在我们的社会中所占据的形象越来越高大。
First, as money looms larger in our societies, affluence – and its absence – matters more.	富有 — — 或者不富有 — — 就变得越发重要。
If the main advantages of affluence were the ability to afford yachts and fancy vacations, inequality would matter less than it does today.	如果富有的主要好处只不过在于能否支付得起游艇或者奢华假期，那么不平等在今时今日的重要性就不会那么大。
But, as money comes to govern access to education, health care, political influence, and safe neighborhoods, life becomes harder for those of modest means.	但随着金钱开始主宰获取教育、医疗，政治影响力和社区安全的渠道，中下收入者的生活就变得越发艰难。
The marketization of everything sharpens the sting of inequality.	所有事物的全盘市场化因此导致不平等状况对人的刺痛感不断增加。
A second reason to resist putting a price tag on all human activities is that doing so can be corrupting.	第二个反对把所有人类活动都贴上价格标签的理由就是这样做可以是道德败坏的。
Prostitution is a classic example.	其中卖淫堪称一个经典例子。
Some object to it on the grounds that it typically exploits the poor, for whom the choice to sell their bodies may not be truly voluntary.	有些人反对卖淫，理由是这是典型的剥削穷人行为，因为那些选择去出卖自己肉体的人可能不是真正自愿的。
But others object on the grounds that reducing sex to a commodity is inherently degrading and objectifying.	而另一些人反对的理由则是将性降格成一种商品是本来就是有辱人格且将人物质化的。
The idea that market relations can corrupt higher goods is not restricted to matters of sex and the body.	这种市场关系可以腐蚀更高层次事物的理念可不仅仅局限在性和人的身体方面。
It also applies to civic goods and practices.	它同样也适用于公共产品和实践。
Consider voting. We don’t allow a free market in votes, even though such a market would arguably be “efficient,” in the economist’s sense of the term.	以投票为例，即便在经济学意义上把投票交给自由市场据说是“更为高效 ” ， 但我们也不会允许这样做。
Many people don’t use their votes, so why let them go to waste?	既然许多人不会使用自己的投票权，那么为什么要让这些选票白白浪费了呢？
Why not let those who don’t much care about an election’s outcome sell their vote to someone who does?	为什么不能让那些不在意选举结果的人把选票出售给其他在意的人？
Both parties to the transaction would be better off.	须知在这场交易中双方都会得益啊。
The best argument against a market in votes is that the vote is not a piece of private property; rather, it is a public responsibility.	但反对投票市场化的最有利论证则认为选票并不是一个私人财产，而是一项社会责任。
To treat a vote as an instrument of profit would be to degrade it, to corrupt its meaning as an expression of civic duty.	将选票当成赚钱工具就等于贬低和腐蚀了其作为一种公民责任表现方式的意义。
But, if a market in votes is objectionable because it corrupts democracy, what about systems of campaign finance (including the one currently in place in the United States) that give wealthy donors a disproportionate voice in elections?	然而如果因为腐蚀民主制度就可以反对一个选票市场，那么又该如何看待那些在选举中给予富有捐助者一个不相称的影响力的竞选筹款体制（包括美国当前这个 ） 。
The reason to reject a market in votes – preserving the integrity of democracy – may be a reason to limit financial contributions to political candidates as well.	反对选票市场的理由 — — 维护民主制度的完整性 — — 或许也是一个限制对政治候选人实施经济资助的理由。
Of course, we often disagree about what counts as “corrupting” or “degrading.”	当然，我们经常会在什么才算是“腐蚀”或“侮辱”上有不同意见。
To decide whether prostitution is degrading, we have to decide how human sexuality is properly valued.	为了认定卖淫是否是种侮辱，我们得定义如何合理地评估人类性活动的价值。
To decide whether selling prison-cell upgrades corrupts the meaning of criminal justice, we have to decide what purpose criminal punishment should serve.	为了认定升级监狱仓室是否侮辱了刑事司法制度，我们必须定义刑罚本身应当服务于什么样的目的。
To decide whether we should allow the buying and selling of human organs for transplantation, or hire mercenaries to fight our wars, we have to think through hard questions about human dignity and civic responsibility.	为了认定是否应该放开人类器官移植或者使用雇佣兵参战，我们需要深刻思考与人类尊严和公民责任有关的问题。
These are controversial questions, and we often try to avoid addressing them in public discourse.	这些都是些富有争议性的问题，而我们也常常试图避免在公共论述中提到它们。
But that is a mistake.	但这是不对的。
Our reluctance to engage morally contested questions in politics has left us ill-equipped to deliberate about one of the most important issues of our time: Where do markets serve the public good, and where do they not belong?	羞于在政治中提及存在道德冲突的问题使我们无力深刻思考我们时代中最重要的议题：市场究竟在哪些领域能促进公共福祉，而哪里又是市场不应涉足的地方？
	
What Next after Failed Sanctions on Iran?	制裁伊朗无效又当如何？
LOS ANGELES amp#45;amp#45; The approval of fresh sanctions on Iran marks the third time that the United Nations Security Council has been galvanized to stem the Islamic Republic’s feared uranium enrichment efforts.	联合国安理会行动起来制止伊朗令人担忧的铀浓缩行动以来已经第三次批准对伊朗实行新的制裁。
Unfortunately, the new sanctions are unlikely to be any more effective than the first two rounds.	不幸的是，新的制裁不大可能比前两次更有效果。
Consider the two earlier Security Council resolutions.	让我们来看一看前两次的安理会决议。
The December 2006 resolution curbed international assistance to Iran in mastering the nuclear fuel cycle.	2006年12月的决议限制国际社会帮助伊朗掌握核燃料循环技术。
The March 2007 resolution called for “vigilance and restraint” in the sale of heavy weapons to Iran and avoidance of new grants, financial assistance, or concessional loans.	2007年3月的决议则呼吁在向伊朗出售重型武器的时候要“审慎和克制 ” ， 并且避免新的赠款、财政援助或者减让性贷款。
Neither moved the country’s ruling mullahs.	而统治伊朗的毛拉们对它们则无动于衷。
Few expect a different outcome from the new sanctions, which authorize international interception of Iranian contraband and tightened monitoring of the regime’s financial institutions, along with travel limitations and asset freezes applied to people and companies involved in Iran’s nuclear program.	新的制裁授权国际社会拦截伊朗的违禁品，加紧监控该政权的金融机构并且对参与伊朗核子项目的人员和公司实施旅行限制和冻结资产，但是很少有人预计它们能够产生什么不同的结果。
The failure of targeted UN sanctions should come as no surprise.	联合国有针对性的制裁未能奏效并不出人意外。
The US has been on the sanctions treadmill for years.	美国多年来一直推动制裁。
Between 2003 and 2007 the US Treasury Department brought litigation against 94 companies for violating the ban against trade and investment in Iran. The State Department imposed sanctions 111 times against foreign entities that engaged in proliferation or terrorism-related activities with Iran.	2003年至2007年间，美国财政部对49家违犯禁令与伊朗贸易并在该国投资的公司提起诉讼。 美国国务院对参与伊朗扩散或者与恐怖主义有关活动的外国实体实行了111次的制裁。
And both departments have used their power to freeze financial assets or access to the US financial system.	这两个部门都使用了其权力来冻结金融资产或者禁止使用美国的金融系统。
The results amounted to little more than a pin prick.	而制裁却无济于事。
Iran’s nuclear programs continued to be financed by international commerce.	伊朗的核子项目继续得到国际贸易的资金。
In 1994, Iran exported $37 billion in goods; by 2007, the figure had nearly doubled, to $70 billion.	1994年，伊朗出口了370亿美元的商品；到2007年，这一数字几乎翻倍，达到700亿美元。
In roughly the same period, Iran’s imports also soared, from $22 billion in 1994 to $45 billion in 2006.	几乎在同一时期，伊朗的进口也大幅度增加，从1994年的220亿美元增加到2006年的450亿美元。
Evaluating two decades of US sanctions to curb Iran’s nuclear appetite, the US Congress’s Government Accountability Office recently concluded that the results are “unclear,” adding with candid obliqueness that “some evidence, such as foreign firms signing contracts to invest in Iran’s energy and Iran’s continued proliferation efforts, raise questions about the extent of the sanctions’ impact.”	美国国会政府职责办公室回顾了二十年来美国为限制伊朗的核子胃口而对其实施的制裁，最近得出结论说其效果“不明朗 ” ， 并且用客气的语调说 ： “ 外国公司签署合同投资于伊朗的能源、伊朗继续扩散等证据对于制裁效果的大小提出了疑问 。 ”
Not only have sanctions failed to halt Iran’s fuel cycle programs, but so have other avenues.	制裁不仅没有阻止伊朗的燃料循环项目，而且其他手段也无济于事。
The European Union’s multiple offers of political and economic inducements went nowhere, as did cajoling by the International Atomic Energy Agency.	欧盟提供多种政治和经济引诱毫无成效，而国际原子能机构的诱胁也是如此。
To be sure Iran offered, in 2005 and subsequently, to tether its program to international co-management, which arguably could have placed resident international monitors on site.	的确，伊朗曾经在2005年以及后来曾经提出将其核子项目处于国际共同管理之下，这样做无疑会将国际监督员派驻现场。
But both the international community and Iran failed to follow through, and now that opportunity has increasingly become moot as Iranian engineers gain confidence in their handiwork.	但是国际社会和伊朗都没有跟进，而且随着伊朗的工程师对其工作增加了信心，这一机会日益无用。
Some hope that the next US administration can stem Iran’s nuclear ambitions through bilateral diplomacy.	有些人希望，美国下届政府可以通过双边外交来阻止伊朗的核子野心。
But Europe’s negotiating experience raises doubts about that prospect, as Iran remains unequivocal about never abandoning its nuclear fuel cycle program.	但是欧洲的谈判经历对这一前景提出了疑问，而伊朗也对绝不放弃核燃料循环项目毫不含糊。
Assuming that concern over Iran’s nuclear “breakout” capacity mounts, this leaves the US and its allies with three options, each with its own risks.	假设对伊朗的核子突破能力的担忧不断增加，美国及其盟国就有三个选择，而每个选择都有各自的风险。
First, a naval blockade (reminiscent of the Cuban missile crisis) that halted both Iran’s oil exports and imports of refined fuel would cripple the country’s economy.	首先，海上封锁(这让人回想其古巴导弹危机)中断伊朗的石油出口以及提炼燃料的进口将会让该国的经济限于瘫痪。
But the US military would have to be able to prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, through which much of the world’s oil supply passes.	但是美国军队不得不将要防止伊朗关闭霍尔穆兹海峡，世界石油供应的很大部分都通过这一海峡。
A halt in Iran’s oil exports alone would dramatically upset international oil markets, and the Iranian leadership would likely dig in its heels to continue, if not accelerate, nuclear development.	仅仅是中止伊朗的石油出口就会大大打乱国际石油市场，而伊朗领导人将会坚持立场，如果不是加速、也会继续其核子发展计划。
Second, while a military strike would slow Iran’s nuclear program, facilities could be rebuilt in the absence of inspectors to find and destroy remnants, regime change, and/or military occupation.	第二，尽管军事打击可以减缓伊朗的核子项目，在没有监察员在场或者军事占领以寻找和销毁残余以及政权改变的情况下，各种设施可以重建。
Moreover, the attack shock could trigger Iranian vengeance regionally and elsewhere, with a global economic impact far exceeding that implied by a blockade.	而且，军事打击的冲击将会引发伊朗在该地区和其他地方实施报复，其对全球经济的影响要远远超过封锁。
This leaves an unsettling fallback option.	这样就只有令人不安的撤回选择了。
An Iran on the cusp of becoming a nuclear-armed state confronting a nuclear-armed Israel bringing its bomb out of the basement.	伊朗即将成为核武国家与具有核武器的以色列对峙。
In that event, there remains the hope that mutual nuclear deterrence will promote mutual common sense.	在这一情形下，人们还是希望相互间的核子威摄将会促进相互间的人类常识。
Absent a dramatic improvement in the Middle East’s grim political landscape, the failure of deterrence would bring the sum of all the fears of our nuclear age upon us.	在中东地区严峻的政治形势没有得到大幅度改善的情况下，威摄无力将会让核子时代的所有恐惧降临到我们头上。
	
What Next After the Gaza Withdrawal?	加沙撤离之后又会是什么？
The withdrawal of Israeli troops and the evacuation of Jewish settlers from Gaza, after 38 years of occupation, is the most recent proof of the limits of military power, even when that power is overwhelming.	在加沙长达38年的占领后，以色列军队的撤退和犹太定居点的撤离是军力限度的最新证明，即便军力再强大也不能例外。
Now is the time to take stock of the lessons learned from the years of occupation and resistance in order to understand what Israelis and Palestinians should do next.	现在应该汲取从多年占领和反抗运动中得来的教训，进而了解以色列和巴勒斯坦人应该怎么做。
To begin with, it is imperative to understand how much credit Palestinians can credibly claim for the Israeli withdrawal.	首先必须弄清巴勒斯坦人在以色列撤军中的贡献到底有多大。
True, Palestinian resistance and sacrifices were a contributing factor in Ariel Sharon’s decision to reverse a policy he had espoused for decades. But it would be a mistake to attribute the Israeli withdrawal exclusively to Palestinian militancy.	没错，巴勒斯坦人的抵抗和牺牲对阿里埃勒·沙龙在摒弃和平政策几十年后的重新回归作出了贡献，但将以色列撤军完全归功于巴勒斯坦的抵抗肯定是错误的。
After all, this bittersweet Israeli action was neither a clear result of military defeat nor a consequence of political negotiations.	毕竟，以色列实施这项苦乐参半的行动并非军事失败和政治谈判的明确结果。
But unilateralism is not a rational long-term and effective policy, for it will not lead to a genuine and lasting peace in the Middle East.	但单方政策绝非合理有效的长期政策，因为它带不来中东地区真正的持久和平。
Just as President Bush has discovered in Iraq, Sharon will also be forced to acknowledge the limits of his strategy.	正如布什总统在伊拉克学到的，沙龙也不得不承认自己政策的局限性。
Unilateralism seems very expedient to shortsighted politicians, for it obviates the need for what they perceive as the mess of actual negotiations – that is, meeting their counterparts face to face and discovering the human results of their policies.	单边政策似乎是目光短浅的政客们最喜欢的权宜之计，因为这样就能避开一团乱麻似的艰苦谈判¾具体地讲，就是与对手面对面地进行交锋，从而弄清不同政策可能产生的人文后果。
Going it alone also seems politically advantageous domestically, because leaders can decide how much and how far they want to carry out a particular policy.	自作主张也能在国内政治中拣到便宜，因为某项政策如何执行和执行到何种程度都由领导人自己决定。
To be fair, unilateralism is convenient not only for a reluctant Israeli prime minister who does not wish to make substantial compromises during negotiations; it is also attractive to hard-line Palestinians who regard multilateralism as a means of pressing them to make unpopular concessions.	公平地讲，单边主义不仅对不愿在谈判中做出实质性让步的以色列总理有利，还能够吸引持强硬态度的巴勒斯坦人，在他们眼中，多边主义不过是一种手段，迫使他们做出不受欢迎的让步。
In any case, the day after the completion of the Gaza withdrawal, Israelis and Palestinians will be confronted with important unresolved questions.	无论如何，加沙撤军完成后，以色列人和巴勒斯坦人还将面对重要的遗留问题。
There is no doubt that the evacuation of Jewish settlers in areas that Israelis consider part of their God-given territory represents a huge ideological reversal.	勿庸置疑，犹太定居者撤出以色列人心目中的神赐之地的确代表了观念上的逆转。
But after years of preaching and practicing one of Zionism’s main tenets, will the removal of settlements continue in the West Bank, or will this be a one-time exception?	但是在多年宣扬和实行犹太复国主义的主要原则后，撤除定居点的行动是将继续下去，还是将成为千古绝唱？
Palestinians, for their part, will be expected to answer questions – in deeds, not just in words – about their ability to build a modern pluralistic state.	巴勒斯坦人需要回答的问题是：他们是否有能力建立现代的多元化国家，实际上，这个问题仅仅用语言回答是远远不够的。
How will the Palestinian body politic deal with the growing power of the Islamic movements that undoubtedly will expect a significant share of power in post-withdrawal Gaza?	巴勒斯坦国将如何应对实力日益增强的伊斯兰运动，面对他们在撤军后的加沙不可忽视的权力要求？
The international community also will have to answer some key questions.	国际社会也需要回答一些重要的问题。
According to the Palestinian Economic Council for Reconstruction and Development (PECDAR), annual per capita income in Gaza continues to average roughly $700, while Israelis enjoy incomes averaging a $16,000 per capita.	据巴勒斯坦发展和重建经济理事会（PECDAR）统计，加沙地带的年人均收入继续维持在大约700美元，而以色列的人均收入却达到了16，000美元。
In the absence of relatively well-paying jobs, what will happen to the lines of unemployed Gazans?	由于缺乏相对高薪的职业机会，失业的加沙人未来又将如何？
The potential flight of employment seekers – a formidable force worldwide – is only one problem.	加沙人为了求职可能会背井离乡，这虽然是一个世界性的难题，但却仅仅是问题的一个方面。
More immediately, if Gazan families are not well fed, the recurrence of cross-border violence, if not the eruption of a third intifada, will only be a matter of time.	更直接的后果是如果加沙家庭的生活继续窘迫下去，那么爆发跨边界暴力，甚至是第三次就地起义都只是一个时间问题。
While the economic situation in Gaza is a critical issue, the future of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict will be determined mainly by the next steps in the peace process.	加沙的经济形势正处在危急关头，而巴以冲突的未来将主要取决于和平进程中的后续步骤。
Permanent-status issues concerning borders, the West Bank, Jerusalem, and refugees must be dealt with bilaterally.	与边界、西岸、耶路撒冷和难民相关的永久性地位问题必须通过双边努力才能得以解决。
Any serious observer of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict will no doubt acknowledge that there can be no unilateral solution to these issues.	巴以冲突的任何认真的观察者都无疑会承认：上述问题不可能找到单边的解决方案。
As for the peace process’s multilateral guarantors, the United States and its quartet partners – the European Union, the United Nations, and Russia – have failed to provide even the most basic facts regarding Israel’s withdrawal or how it relates to the “road map” agreed in 2003.	至于和平进程的多边担保人，美国及其四重奏表演的搭档，欧盟、联合国和俄国，甚至未能就有关以色列撤军的最基本事实或与2003年路线图计划的关系达成一致。
They cannot continue to sit on the sidelines.	他们再也不能冷眼旁观了。
Washington’s quixotic decision to call Israel’s unilateral move part of the road map has failed to convince many Palestinians.	华盛顿将以色列单边行动纳入路线图计划的幻想对多数巴勒斯坦人来讲根本没有说服力。
The prevailing opinion among Palestinians is that the road map will be put into deep freeze once the Israelis complete their Gaza withdrawal.	巴勒斯坦人中普遍流行的观点是：一旦以色列完成从加沙的撤军，路线图计划就会进入深度休眠的状态。
But the Palestinian and Israeli peoples, their leaders, and the international community must all respond to the challenges that will follow.	但巴勒斯坦���、以色列人、两国领袖和国际社会都必须对接踵而来的挑战做出反应。
Most importantly, the future of the conflict and the chances for genuine peace in the region will depend on understanding the limits of offensive military power, defensive resistance, and unilateralism.	最为重要的是，巴以冲突的未来和真正实现地区和平的机遇将会取决于人们是否了解进攻性军事力量、防御性自卫和单边主义各自的局限。
Serious face-to-face talks, in accordance to international law and with the help of the international community, are the only way forward.	取决于人们能否在国际社会的帮助下，按照国际法的规定进行认真的面对面谈判。 这才是解决问题的唯一出路。
	
What Next After the Likud Referendum?	利库德公决之后的巴以局势
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's proposal for a unilateral Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and part of the West Bank has been overwhelmingly defeated by a referendum within his own party, Likud, in what seems to be a humiliating defeat.	阿里尔•沙龙总理企图让以色列从约旦河西岸和加沙地带单方面撤离的提议被其所在政党"利库德集团"的公决所否定。
Yet this is likely to have little or no effect on Sharon's intention to carry through with the plan.	这次失败看似个奇耻大辱，但它似乎完全没有影响沙龙实施这项计划的意图。
At first, this seems surprising, since he said before the referendum that he would abide by its outcome.	乍一看这有点让人惊讶。 因为他在全党公决以前曾表示会遵守表决的结果。
But Sharon is 75 years old and probably within two years of retirement.	但沙龙已是75岁高龄，并且有可能在两年内退休。
He is determined that his plan becomes his political legacy.	他是决心要让这项计划成为其政治遗策。
Since there is no precedent for a party referendum, he can argue that the vote does not bind him.	由于从未有过党内公决的先例，他可以争辩说自己不受表决结果束缚。
Moreover, Sharon made sure that his main political rivals - notably former Prime Minister Benjamin (Bibi) Netanyahu - supported his plan.	此外，沙龙还确保了其主要的政治对手-特别是前总理本杰明•内塔尼亚胡-支持他的计划。
They are now in no position to challenge him as the champions of the opposition within Likud.	如此一来，他们现在就不能以利库德集团内部反对派的拥护者的身份对他发起挑战了。
So while some members may walk out, Sharon can easily hold on to control of the party.	因此，虽然有些党员可能弃他而去，沙龙也能轻易地控制党内的局面。
In addition, many Sharon supporters, torn by what they saw as the plan's combination of costs and benefits, stayed home or even voted against it, but still want Sharon as their leader.	另外，许多沙龙的支持者在这项计划所包含的成本和利益之间进退两难。 他们有的弃权，有的甚至投票反对，但仍然都希望沙龙担任他们的领导。
But Sharon is prepared to go even further in taking political risks to push through the withdrawal.	但沙龙已经准备好承担政治风险，进一步推进他的撤离计划。
Small right-wing parties in his coalition have already announced that his determination to do so will make them walk out of the government.	沙龙联合政府中的一些右翼小党派已经宣称如果沙龙决心实施这项计划就会使他们退出政府。
Sharon will then turn to the leader of the opposition, 80-year-old former prime minister Shimon Peres, to form a national unity government.	在那样的形势下，沙龙会转而寻求反对派领导人，80岁高龄的前首相西蒙•佩雷斯的支持，组建国家团结政府。
And Peres is ready to do so.	佩雷斯已做好了准备。
The passionate debate stirred up by Sharon's plan shows how truly revolutionary his proposal is.	沙龙的计划所引起的激烈辩论反映了他的建议多么具有革命性。
Having the army uproot Jewish settlements - with inevitable scenes of settlers resisting and being dragged off - will be a traumatic event for the country.	让军队拆除犹太人定居点-不可避免的引发定居者抗拒然后被拖走的场面-这会给这个国家造成创伤。
The plan also entails considerable strategic risks, which, probably more than the prospect of uprooted settlements, account for the large "no" by Likud members.	这项计划还会带来比拆除定居点更为巨大的战略风险，即引发利库德集团内部多数人的反对之声。
A key concern is the precedent of withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000.	2000年从黎巴嫩南部撤离的前车之鉴让人不由得对沙龙的撤离计划担忧。
Today, most Israelis believe that this step, though justified on strategic grounds in the face of constant attacks by the Lebanese group Hizbollah, convinced Palestinians that violence worked.	今天，大多数的以色列人认为上一次撤离虽然是在不断遭受黎巴嫩Hizbollah组织攻击之下的正确战略决策，但也让巴勒斯坦人相信暴力是有用的。
In the same manner, a withdrawal from Gaza, many people worry, will bring increased anarchy there and a rise in overall terrorist attacks.	同样，许多人担心从加沙地带撤离会加剧该地区的无政府状态和全面的恐怖袭击。
But convinced - as are most Israelis - that there is no Palestinian partner ready to negotiate seriously and implement its promises, the prime minister wants to prepare for an extended interim period.	但正如大多数的以色列人一样，沙龙首相也确信巴勒斯坦人并不准备进行认真的谈判并履行他们的承诺。 所以他要为一段延长的过渡期做准备。
Assuming that terrorist attacks against Israel are going to continue under any circumstances, he seeks to improve the country's strategic position to handle this war.	假定恐怖分子对以色列的袭击在任何情况下都会继续，他正寻求改善以色列控制这场战争的战略地位。
Combined with the long-completed security fence around the Gaza Strip and one being built near Israel's border with the West Bank, pulling out of the most exposed positions is intended to reduce casualties and the number of clashes with the Palestinians.	结合包围加沙地带的早已完工的安全屏障和正在以色列和约旦河西岸边界修建的屏障，以色列从最无掩护的地方撤退是为了减少伤亡和与巴勒斯坦人的冲突。
A secondary intention is to show the world that Israel is ready to withdraw from most of the remaining territories it captured in 1967 in exchange for real peace.	第二层意图则是向世界显示以色列准备从其在1967年占领的大多数领土撤退以换取真正的和平。
The United States and Britain have supported the withdrawal plan, while most other European countries have been critical.	美英两国对撤退计划表示支持，而大多数欧洲国家则持批评态度。
While demanding an Israeli withdrawal for years, the Palestinian leadership opposes Sharon's plan, arguing it is intended to create permanent borders.	虽然巴勒斯坦领导层长久以来一直要求以色列撤离，但他们此次却反对沙龙的计划，认为这是想要制造永久的边界。
Nevertheless, if implemented, Sharon's proposal would leave them in control of about 99 percent of the Gaza Strip and roughly 50 percent of the West Bank.	可无论如何，如果该计划得以实施，巴勒斯坦人将会控制约99%的加沙地带和约旦河西岸近50%的土地。
If it appears that the withdrawal will proceed and Sharon can assemble a government to implement it, the Palestinian side will then face a major challenge.	如果撤离会得以实施且沙龙有能力组建一个政府来实施该计划，那么巴勒斯坦方面就会面临一个巨大的挑战。
Will it be able to put together an effective governmental authority to rule the Gaza Strip, or will that area dissolve into bloody battles among Palestinian factions and a staging area for attacks into Israel that will bring reprisal raids?	他们有能力组建一个政府性的机构去管理加沙地带吗？ 抑或该地区会陷入巴勒斯坦血腥的派系斗争之中并成为发动会招致以色列报复性打击的恐怖袭击的基地呢？
A key issue in this mix is the division of power between the nationalist Fatah group and the Islamist Hamas organization.	这个问题的关键是民族主义的"法塔赫"组织和伊斯兰主义的"哈马斯"之间的权力分化。
Local Fatah officials want support from their leader, Yassir Arafat, to take firm control of the territory.	当地的"法塔赫"官员希望得到其领导人阿拉法特的支持以牢固地控制该领土。
But Arafat has shown a willingness to let groups act as they please, apparently believing that continuing unrest will bring international sympathy and intervention on his behalf.	但阿拉法特的表现却像是希望该组织内的不同利益集团自行其是，明显是希望继续的不安定局面会引来国际社会的同情和干预。
Yet Arafat himself will be 75 in a few months and is clearly reaching the end of his career.	而阿拉法特自己在几个月后就75岁，已经到了其政治生涯的尽头。
He has been the only leader his movement has ever known, having led Fatah for 40 years and the Palestinians as a whole for 35 years.	在领导了"法塔赫"40年及全体巴勒斯坦人35年之后，他是其所发起的运动中唯一一位被公众熟悉的领导者。
With no apparent successor, his departure from the scene will bring a massive and unpredictable shake-up in Palestinian politics.	在没有指明继任者的情况下，他的离开会给巴勒斯坦政局带来巨大的，不可预知的动荡。
The Israeli government's projection has been that both the withdrawal and the security fence will be completed by the end of 2005.	按照以色列政府的构想，撤离计划和安全屏障都会在2005年底完成。
Sharon's retirement is likely to come within another twelve months, with a new opposition leader having to be chosen as well.	沙龙极有可能在未来的12个月内退休，而同期的巴勒斯坦也存在领导人更替的问题。
Thus, while the Likud referendum seems to have left the Israeli-Palestinian dispute at yet another impasse, both sides are on the verge of enormous changes.	因此，虽然利库德的全党公决似乎使以巴争端陷入了另一个僵局，但双方的政局都处在巨变的边缘。
	
What Next for Europe?	欧洲何去何从？
In many ways, 2005 has been Europe’s annus horibilis.	在很多方面，2005年对于欧洲而言都是不堪回首。
It began well, when Spanish voters approved the draft European Union constitution, but it turned sour when French and Dutch voters spurned it soon after.	年初西班牙选民批准欧盟宪法时开局顺利。 但是，当法国和荷兰选民不久拒绝该宪法时，形势就急转而下。
Those votes partly reflected displeasure with domestic policies, and partly disappointment with the way governments conduct European affairs.	那些选民拒绝宪法，部分是由于不满国内政策，部分则是对政府处理欧洲事务的方式感到失望。
Governments promptly obliged with more of the same.	欧洲各国政府随即变本加厉。
Within days of the votes, they failed to agree on the EU budget for 2007-13.	投票几天后，它们未能就2007年到2013年的欧盟预算达成一致。
French and British leaders engaged in a heated quarrel that derailed the subsequent summit, before Britain assumed the rotating six-month EU presidency in July.	英国在七月就任欧盟轮值主席国前，法英两国领导人争吵不休，使得欧盟峰会不欢而散。
Normally, countries use their EU presidencies to display their ability to solve problems and move the Union forward.	通常，各国会利用轮值主席国的时机来展示其有能力解决问题并推动欧盟前进。
But, as of early December, Britain has remained dormant.	但是，直至12月初，英国却保持低沉。
Besides burying the draft constitution, it has largely sidestepped the budget issue.	除了终止欧盟宪法外，它还大体上绕过了预算问题。
Chances that it gets the budget approved this year are slim, and, unless the dispute is resolved soon, the Union will not have an operational budget by 2007.	今年内批准这一预算的机会渺茫，而且，除非马上解决争端，否则，到2007年欧盟将没有一个运营预算。
Even if a budget is adopted, there is no lack of depressing business for the Austrian presidency, which starts on January 1.	即使批准预算，当奥地利在1月1日就任轮值主席国之时，棘手的问题也会堆积如山。
The deepest problem is Europe’s inability to grow at more than a snail’s pace and to provide jobs to its citizens.	最为严重的问题是，欧洲经济增长迟缓，无法提供就业机会。
This is mostly due to the Big Three – France, Germany, and Italy – which produce 70% of Europe’s GDP.	这主要是由于欧盟三大国的问题，即法国、德国和意大利。 三国的国民生产总值占欧洲的70 ％ 。
The collective response, adopted in 2000, has been the “Lisbon Strategy,” which aims at making the EU “the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world” by 2010.	2000年采取的联合举动是所谓的“里斯本战略 ” ， 其目标是将欧盟在2010年前变成“世界上最富活力和竞争力的知识经济体 ” 。
More realistically, it is designed to provide governments with the incentive to undertake the reforms that stimulate economic growth and productivity.	出于更为现实的原因，这一战略激励各国政府实施改革，解决抑制经济增长和生产效率的问题。
That means facing down the myriad interest groups – from industry lobbies to trade unions and entrenched bureaucracies – that have (so far) successfully protected their turfs.	这就意味着抵制难以计数的从产业游说团体到工会乃至地位稳固的官僚组织等利益集团。 目前为止，它们成功地保护了它们的既得利益。
The strategy rests on peer pressure, naming and shaming governments that fail to make progress.	里斯本战略依赖于同等地位者的压力，点名未能取得进展的政府并使其蒙羞。
In practice, however, peer pressure has become peer collusion.	然而在实际上，这一压力成为串通。
When EU leaders met last spring to assess progress, they pitifully recognized that the Lisbon Strategy’s goal was unlikely to be met.	今年春季欧盟领导人开会评估进展之时，他们可怜地承认里斯本战略的目标难以实现。
The best that they could do now would be to dump the pretense of a strategy and carry on with the other business.	他们所能做的是放弃战略的托辞而着手其他事务。
Unfortunately, the host of the 2000 summit was José Manuel Barroso, then Prime Minister of Portugal and current President of the European Commission, who has staked his presidency on the Lisbon Strategy.	不幸的是，2000年欧盟峰会的东道主是当时的葡萄牙首相和现任欧盟委员会主席巴罗佐。 他将欧盟委员会主席的成败系于里斯本战略。
Expect him to push on hopelessly.	可以想见他知其不可为而为之。
One of the few good ideas contained in the Lisbon Strategy was to remove barriers to trade in services.	里斯本战略包含的少数明智之策是消除服务贸易壁垒。
Intra-European competition in services is restricted by innumerable national regulations that, for instance, strictly determine the requirements for becoming a hairdresser or a plumber.	欧盟各国内部难以计数的规章限制了各国间服务业竞争。 例如，有的规定成为理发师或水管工的条件要求。
One of the defining features of the past decades is the sharp increase in services productivity in the US; none of that happened in Europe.	过去十年最显著的特征是美国的服务业生产效率大幅提高，而欧洲则悄无声息。
Guess why.	猜一猜原因。
Because services account for 70% of European GDP, the potential impact from enhanced competition is substantial.	由于服务业占欧洲GDP的70 ％ ， 提高竞争后可能造成的影响剧烈。
But removing protection is always politically difficult.	但是，消除保护总归在政治上难以做到。
The European Commission submitted a proposal in 2005 – just as the constitution was being put up for a vote.	欧盟委员会在2005年欧盟宪法全民公决时提出一项建议。
Not surprisingly, the proposal was quickly shelved.	不出所料，这一建议立即被束之高阁。
Now, with countless private interest groups trying to water it down into irrelevance, the battle will be firmly on the EU’s agenda in 2006.	现在，众多的私营利益集团试图削弱这一建议使其无关痛痒。 这一斗争将无疑提上欧盟2006年的议事日程。
At the same time, Europe is again blocking progress in the Doha round of world trade talks, with the farmers’ lobby fighting to preserve its subsidies.	同时，由于欧洲农民抗争要求保留补贴，欧洲再一次阻挡世界贸易组织多哈回合谈判的进展。
Many governments are so fearful of their farmers that they see no other option than to hold their ground, no matter what.	众多国家政府惧怕农民，从而除坚持立场外别无他途。
Europe has agreed to a single trade policy.	欧洲有统一的贸易政策。
When disagreements run as deep as they do on agriculture, there can be no give-and-take of the kind that allows for successful negotiations.	如果分歧正如农业问题一般严重，则毫无妥协退让可言，惶论谈判成功。
There is little reason for optimism.	对前景也就毫不乐观。
And what next for the ECB, which has just nudged up interest rates by 0.25%, after 30 months on hold.	欧洲中央银行在30个月纹丝不动后新近将利率提升0.25 ％ 。 其前景如何呢？
Experts can disagree about whether the move was premature, but no one agrees with the many political leaders who have argued that the tiny hike will derail the timid resumption of economic growth.	专家对于升息是否过早可能见仁见智，但是并无人同意政治领导人的观点，即利率微升会破坏微弱的经济增长复苏。
The sharpness of political attacks on the ECB might trigger dangerous talk about restricting its independence.	对于欧洲央行尖锐的政治抨击可能引发有关限制其独立性的讨论。
While such a move is out of the question – it would require a change in the European Treaty – the noise is unhealthy.	尽管这一举措需要修改欧盟条约而不可能，但是这一噪音却并不健康。
It distracts the ECB, adds to the impression that Europe is bad, and, more importantly, will be used by ineffective governments as a scapegoat for their failings.	它干扰欧洲央行，增加了欧洲有害的印象，而且，更为重要的是，无能为力的政府可以此为其失策寻找替罪羊。
Expect more ECB-bashing.	将会有更多的对欧洲央行的抨击。
Is Europe stuck?	欧洲是否陷入泥潭？
The current team of leaders has been an enormous disappointment.	目前的欧洲领导人团队令人大失所望。
But as they fade away, there could be some light at the end of the tunnel.	但是随着他们的淡出，隧道尽头可能会出现亮光。
In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel is obviously more positive on Europe and more pro-reform than her predecessor, but she is tied up in a grand coalition.	在德国，默克尔总���与她的前任相比更为肯定欧洲并更为亲改革，但是她却受大联合政府的束缚。
In France, President Jacques Chirac, the epitome of a leader captured by his lobbies, is staggering impotently toward the end of his term in 2007.	在法国，作为被其游说集团俘虏的缩影，希拉克总统正虚弱无力地踟蹰迈向2007年任期届满。 继任者中的两位佼佼者德维尔潘和萨尔科齐都在政府任职。
The two frontrunners to succeed him, Dominique de Villepin and Nicolas Sarkozy, both in government, compete on a reformist agenda, but pre-election years do not encourage bold moves.	他们在改革议程上互不相让。 然而，大选前几年里并不鼓励大胆的举措。
Meanwhile, Italy must decide whether it replaces Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who displayed no interest in reform and European affairs, with the cautious Romano Prodi, the former European Commission President.	与此同时，意大利必须决定是否用前任欧盟委员会主席普罗狄更换对改革和欧洲事务毫无兴趣的总理贝鲁斯科尼。
Tony Blair, once an ardent pro-European (at least by Britain’s undemanding standards), might finally have to cede power to Gordon Brown, who is famously cold to European integration.	至少根据英国松软的标准，英国首相布莱尔曾经是热烈的亲欧洲派。 他可能最终让位给布朗，而布朗对欧洲联合冷漠众所周知。
Fortunately, Britain has always been an outsider.	幸运的是，英国素来是欧洲联合的局外人。
In the end, whatever light there is, it may not shine until 2007, after the French elections.	最终，在法国2007年总统大选前，无论有何光亮都不会闪烁。
	
What Next in Afghanistan?	阿富汗，下一步怎么办？
BERLIN – Afghanistan’s future does not look good.	柏林 — — 阿富汗前景不妙。
The Taliban are gaining military and political strength, and President Hamid Karzai is losing support at home and internationally due to his administration’s rampant corruption and the obvious fraud committed in his re-election.	塔利班在军事、政治上日益坐大，总统哈米德·卡尔扎伊在国内、国外渐失人心 — — 他的政府太过腐败，而他的再度当选则明显存在舞弊。
Weariness with the war is spreading in the United States, where President Barack Obama finds it difficult to decide about an increase in troops, as demanded by his own generals.	美国国内的厌战情绪不断蔓延，于是乎贝拉克·奥巴马总统增兵阿富汗的命令迟迟难以下达，尽管他的将军已一再敦促。
European NATO members with troops in Afghanistan would prefer to withdraw them today rather than tomorrow.	在阿富汗驻有军队的欧洲北约成员国则一门心思地想要早日抽身而出。
The West seems to have lost its orientation in the Hindu Kush – that “graveyard of empires,” as it was called after the British disaster in January 1842, when only one man survived an expedition 16,000.	西方国家似乎在兴都库什山区迷失了方向 — — 1842年1月，第一次英阿战争期间，一支1万6千人的英国远征军在此遭阿富汗军袭击，仅一人生还，这一带由此得名“帝国的坟墓 ” 。
What, many people are asking, is NATO really fighting for in Afghanistan?	许多人质疑，北约在阿富汗，究竟为什么而战？
Europe remains silent on that question and has only one aim: to get out.	欧洲对此质疑仍避而不答，心里只想着如何脱身。
In the US, the debate about the purposes being served in Afghanistan is at least still taking place.	在美国，至少还有人辩论，继续阿富汗战争意义何在。
Follow it, and you will conclude that, ultimately, the war is all about the American superpower’s military victory over the Taliban, so that it can finally withdraw its troops – for a second time.	细究下去，你将得出结论：说到底，阿富汗战争打到这个份上，作为超级大国的美国，其目的无非是从军事上彻底打败塔利班，好让自己的军队最终能够撤出来 — — 这将是美国第二次从阿富汗撤军。
The source or meaning of the conflict in Afghanistan is impossible to find in the country itself.	发生在阿富汗的战争有什么意义，答案不可能在阿富汗内部找到。
Afghanistan is the battlefield, but the causes of the wars that have devastated it since the mid-1970’s were and are still to be found beyond its borders.	阿富汗只是外部势力的角斗场而已，自20世纪70年代以来，这里爆发的历次战争，根源都在国外。
So an exclusively “Afghan solution” is not possible.	所以，想找到一种局限于阿富汗的“阿富汗解决方案 ” ， 只是痴人说梦。
Three dates are central to understanding today’s Afghan quagmire: 1989, 2001, and 2003.	要理解今日的阿富汗泥潭，有三个年份必须牢记：1989、2001和2003。
In 1989, when the Cold War ended, the Red Army had already withdrawn from the country, thereby admitting its defeat.	1989年，冷战告终，苏联从阿富汗撤军，实质上承认在苏阿战争中失败。 美国也随即撤出。
Following the Soviet Union, the US withdrew from the conflict, too, and at that moment, the second Afghan war started – a proxy war between regional neighbors over power in the Hindu Kush, disguised as a civil war.	于是阿富汗内战再度爆发 — — 说是内战，其实是一场代理人战争，是盘踞在兴都库什山区和武装力量和邻近的各部武装之间的一场混战。
Supported by Saudi Arabia, Pakistan sought strategic depth against its arch-enemy India with the help of militant religious students from Afghan refugee camps. These “Taliban” were created and equipped by the Pakistani secret service, the ISI.	为了寻求战略纵深以对抗世仇印度，巴基斯坦在沙特阿拉伯的支持下，以阿富汗难民营好战的宗教学生为班底拉起一支队伍 — — 由巴基斯坦三军情报局（ISI）一手组建和武装起来的“塔利班 ” 。
Iran defended its own interests and those of the Shia minority in the west of the country.	为了本国利益，也为了保护阿富汗西部地区的少数派 — — 什叶派穆斯林，伊朗也介入了阿富汗。
And in the north, the Tajik Northern Alliance and Abdul Rashid Dostum’s Uzbek militia were supported and equipped by Afghanistan’s northern neighbors and Russia.	在阿富汗北部，塔吉克族背景的北部同盟和阿卜杜勒·拉希德·杜斯塔姆领导的乌兹别克族武装背后则是阿富汗的北方邻国和俄罗斯。
In the shadow of this second Afghan war, Osama bin Laden established his terrorist organization in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan: Al Qaeda, which, on September 11, 2001, carried out its terrible terrorist attack on the US.	在阿富汗内战的背景下，奥萨马·本·拉登在塔利班统治下的阿富汗创建了恐怖组织 — — “基地组织 ” 。 该组织于2001年9月11日对美国发动了骇人听闻的恐怖袭击。
A month later, the current war in Afghanistan started.	一个月之后，目前的这场阿富汗战争开打。
In March 2003, George W. Bush launched his invasion of Iraq, not only squandering America’s military strength, but also connecting all the individual crises between the eastern Mediterranean and the Indus Valley.	2003年3月，时任美国总统的乔治·W·布什入侵伊拉克，这一决策非常愚蠢，不仅耗费了美国大量军力，而且促使地中海以东到印度河流域广大地区原先互不相干的几个冲突点连成了一片。
As a result of America’s foreign-policy folly, Iran became the central geo-political player in the entire region, linking the western and eastern part of this long belt of instability.	美国对外政策上的昏招令伊朗成为整个区域的地缘政治核心力量，成为连结起该区域东西地带不稳定因素的桥梁。
So, those who are grappling with the Afghan riddle today should consider, first and foremost, the regional realities: can the West afford to withdraw?	所以，我奉劝那些正为阿富汗焦头烂额的人们，首先好好思考一下这一地区的现实：西方国家能否承受从阿富汗撤军所要付出的代价？
If so, we should pull out of Afghanistan immediately.	如果能，我们就立即撤出阿富汗。
If not, we should stop discussing an “exit strategy.”	如果不能，我们就别再为讨论什么“推出战略”而白费唇舌了。
The cost of the West’s retreat from this troubled region is predictable, since we must deal with several threats that endanger Western security, and that would not disappear with withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan: terrorism, Islamist radicalism, nuclear threats (Pakistan, Iran), proxy wars and regional conflicts (Israel-Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kashmir), and looming disintegration (Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and in the longer term in the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Peninsula).	西方国家从这一混乱地区撤军的代价是可以预估的。 西方安全的几大威胁并不会随着从伊拉克和阿富汗撤军而消失：恐怖主义、伊斯兰极端势力、核威胁（巴基斯坦与伊朗 ） 、 代理人战争、地区冲突（巴以冲突、伊拉克、阿富汗和克什米尔地区）以及愈演愈烈的脱离国际秩序中���倾向（伊拉克、阿富汗、巴基斯坦，从长远来看还包括波斯湾以及阿拉伯半岛 ） 。
This means that we cannot talk about withdrawing our troops, but only of redrawing the battle line farther West.	这说明，西方国家完全撤军根本是不可能的，最多是向西收缩战线。
It is extremely doubtful that such a step would bring more security.	即便走向西收缩战线这一步棋，是否会使安全形势得到很大改善，也是极其值得怀疑的一件事。
On the other hand, the West’s strategy in Afghanistan up to now has also yielded little progress, only strengthening the Taliban day by day.	但另一方面，西方国家的阿富汗战略到目前为止也没有取得多大进展，反而一天天壮大了塔利班。
So what should we do?	如此进退维谷之际，我们应当怎么做？
First, we need to define a clear political goal: a stable status quo in Afghanistan that will prevent the country from again becoming a battlefield of regional interests and an organizational base for Al Qaeda.	首先，我们得树立一个明确的政治目标：在不打破现状的前提下稳定阿富汗局势，防止这个国家再次沦为地区博弈的战场，或者成为基地组织的庇护所和大本营。
Without a sufficient military presence, as well as improved and reinforced reconstruction efforts, this goal is not attainable.	要实现这一目标，需要充足的军力投入和更有效的重建努力，两者缺一不可。
Second, a renewed regional consensus on Afghanistan’s future would also help avoid further destabilizing nuclear-armed Pakistan.	其次，协调各方，就阿富汗的前途达成共识。 这也有助于遏止巴基斯坦进一步滑向内乱，要知道巴基斯坦可是拥有核武器的国家。
This requires that Pakistan’s and Iran’s interests be included in this consensus, as well as India’s, Saudi Arabia’s and probably also China’s. (The Kashmir conflict must, indirectly, play a role in this settlement, but the difficulties of including it should not be underestimated.)	这样一个共识必须照顾到巴基斯坦、伊朗、印度、沙特阿拉伯甚至中国的利益（克什米尔地区冲突必然会间接影响这一共识的形成，不过要把它纳入议程的难度不容低估 ） 。
Forging this consensus will not be an easy diplomatic task.	促成这一共识并不是一个轻松的外交使命，但它并非不可完成。
But it is feasible and should be the goal of a new conference on Afghanistan.	应召开一次新的阿富汗问题国际会议，把这个目标明确起来。
Third, a parallel effort at crisis containment – and perhaps even at finding solutions – is needed for the wider Middle East, Iraq, the Persian Gulf, and Iran.	第三，与此同时，需要在中东、伊拉克、波斯湾和伊朗也就是更广大的中东地区缓和危机，甚至寻求解决方案。
It’s an equation with very many known unknowns, but if we do not try at least to mitigate these issues, the known unknowns will continue challenging all partial solutions.	我们早已意识到，这一进程充满未知变数，但如果我们连试都不试，这些已经意识到的未知数必将继续挑战一切局部性的解决方案。
But the big question remains whether the US and its European allies still have the strength, perseverance and far-sightedness for such an undertaking.	说一千，道一万，根本的问题在于，美国及其欧洲盟友是否还有足够的实力、坚毅与远见来承担这一使命。
There are good reasons to doubt this.	人们有理由怀疑。
The alternative would be a chaotic and dangerous future in this large hot spot.	但如果我们不这样做，这个大“火药桶”就势必面临一个混乱而危险的前景。
Afghanistan may seem far away, but its chaos and violence are in fact just next door.	阿富汗看似遥远，但那里的混乱和暴力其实就是我们家门口的威胁。
	
What Now In the Middle East?	中东现在该怎么办？
The political and security situation in the vast region between the Indus Valley and the shores of the Eastern Mediterranean is a cause for grave concern.	从印度河到地中海东海岸之间地域广阔，政治和安全形势却不容乐观。
When the US intervened militarily in Iraq in 1991, the intention was to effect fundamental change in the entire region.	1991年，美军抱着给整个地区带来根本性变化的初衷入侵伊拉克。
Today it is clear that hardly any aspect of this policy has succeeded. Even the success of free elections in Iraq is threatening to divide rather than unite the country.	到今天，形势已经渐趋明朗，美国的政策没有在任何方面取得成功，即便的确在伊拉克成功地实现了自由选举，也没有因此带来伊拉克的团结，相反却使这个国家进一步四分五裂。
The existing power relations in the Middle East have indeed been permanently shaken and, indeed, revolutionized.	美军入侵的确从根本上动摇了中东现有的权力关系，带来了一场轰轰烈烈的权力革命。
The effect however, has not been a domino-like democratization; instead we are threatened with a domino effect of descent into chaos.	但想象中多米诺骨牌式的民主化进程并没有因此实现，恰恰相反，摆在我们面前的却是一连串的混乱局势。
The decision to go to war against Iraq to liberate Kuwait, back in 1991, marked the beginning of America’s role as the sole hegemonic military power in the region.	1991年做出对伊宣战、解放科威特的决定，标志着美国开始成为中东地区唯一的军事霸权。
The decision to go to war against Iraq for a second time, and then to occupy the country in March 2003, transformed this hegemony into direct US responsibility for the future of the Middle East.	第二次对伊宣战、并在2003年3月占领伊拉克，将美国的军事霸权演变成了对中东未来所承担的直接责任。
Two outcomes could flow from America’s adopted role as the decisive power in the Middle East.	美国成为中东霸主可能带来两种结果。
Were the US to succeed in using its military strength, it would create a new, democratic Middle East. But were it, despite its military might, to fail, it would create a power vacuum and destabilize the region.	如果美国成功地施展其军事力量，将会缔造出一个崭新、民主的中东；可如果军事霸权遭受失败，带来的必将是地区的动荡和权力的真空。
The second scenario – which was foreseeable from the outset – has now become a reality.	后一种情况从战争一开始就可以预见，现在果然变成了现实。
The very character of the war in Iraq has been transformed from a democratizing mission into a stabilizing mission high in casualties and in cost.	伊拉克战争的性质也从追求民主降格为制止动荡，伴随着大量的人员伤亡和财产损失。
Instead of the intended radical realignment of power relations in the region, the aim is now to simply maintain the status quo.	原本期待的地区权力关系的彻底调整终于没有实现，而当前的目标已经沦落为简单地维持现状。
The most the US can hope at this point is a withdrawal that saves face.	现在，既能安全撤军、又能保留些许颜面已经是美国所能期待的最佳选择。
The recent elections in America were a referendum on the war in Iraq.	不久前进行的美国选举实际上是关于伊拉克战争的全民公决。
Their result in fact set a timetable for the “Iraqisation” and US withdrawal – before the next presidential election.	选举的结果实际确定了“伊拉克自制”和美军撤退的具体计划，而所有这一切都要在下一届总统大选前完成。
Behind the all-too-foreseeable end of the American stabilizing mission lurks a civil war in Iraq, which threatens to turn into an Arab-Iranian proxy war for dominance in Iraq, the Gulf, Lebanon, the Palestinian territories, and beyond.	美国稳定行动的结果怎样已经毫无悬念，但在这毫无悬念的结果背后，一场伊拉克内战正在酝酿之中。 这场内战很可能演变为阿拉伯－伊朗为争夺伊拉克、波斯湾、黎巴嫩、巴勒斯坦和其余地区霸权而一手操纵的傀儡战争。
Moreover, there is an acute risk that the power vacuum created in Iraq will fuse the Israeli-Arab conflict, Iraq, and Afghanistan into one regional mega-crisis.	不仅如此，伊拉克的权力真空使得以巴冲突、伊拉克和阿富汗冲突演变成为大规模地区冲突的危险已经迫在眉睫。
In light of America’s impending withdrawal, the regional powers are reassessing their interests and objectives.	在美军即将撤离的背景下，各地区大国正在重新审视自己的利益和目标。
Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan, Turkey, and Israel will be the main players.	伊朗、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯、埃及、约旦、巴基斯坦、土耳其和以色列将会扮演主要角色。
With the Iraq war, the US has lost its unilateral-power position in the Middle East, and elsewhere.	对伊战争后，美国失去了它在中东及世界各地独一无二的霸主地位。
In the future, various global powers will be active in the Middle East – primarily the US, Russia, China, India.	从今以后，包括美国、俄国、中国、印度在内的各大强国将活跃在中东的历史舞台。
Let’s hope Europe is amongst them, because its security is defined there.	让我们共同期待欧洲也能在其中扮演重要角色，因为中东的局势也直接关系到欧洲的安全。
So at stake is no longer just Iraq, but rather the future of the entire region.	因此，这不仅关系到伊拉克的命运，而且关系到整个地区的未来。
We can count ourselves lucky if the emerging chaos can be contained in Iraq.	如果伊拉克即将到来的混乱局势能够得到控制，这将是我们共同的幸运。
Washington’s realization that Iraq can no longer be won or even stabilized unless the regional framework changes, has come late – perhaps too late.	当华盛顿最终认识到除非地区构架发生变化，否则伊拉克战争不仅没有战胜者，甚至就连最基本的局势稳定都将成为奢望的时候已经迟了¾或许是太迟了。
The US will have to find agreement with its allies and enter into direct talks with all the other players to try and achieve a new regional consensus.	美国必须与盟国达成一致，同其他国家展开直接对话，以图达成新的地区共识。
If this policy shift had taken place a year ago or even early last summer, the prospects would have been better.	同样的政策变化如果发生在一年前、甚至发生在去年夏天，前景都会比现在乐观。
And with every passing day, America’s position in the region is weakening further and the chances of a successful new political strategy become more remote.	随着时间一天天流逝，美国在中东的地位也一天天衰弱，新对策的成功前景也将因此变得更加渺茫。
The greatest danger stems from Iran, the clear beneficiary of the Iraqi power vacuum.	最大的威胁来自于伊朗，这个国家显然从伊拉克的权力真空中坐收渔翁之利。
Iran harbors hegemonic ambitions which it seeks to realize by means of its military potential, oil and gas reserves, its nuclear program, its influence over Shiites throughout the region, and its efforts to upset the status quo within the Arab Muslim world.	伊朗野心勃勃，要凭借自身的军事实力、油气储备、核能计划、遍布整个地区的什叶派影响和破坏阿拉伯穆斯林世界现有格局的计划来谋求自己在中东地区的霸权。
Yet Iran is also relatively isolated.	但伊朗也因此备受冷落。
Its only allies in the region are Syria and Hezbollah.	它在地区之内的唯一盟友是叙利亚和黎巴嫩真主党。
What’s more, it is threatened by a de-facto anti-Iranian coalition of all other regional powers, united by their fear of Iranian ascendancy.	不仅如此，伊朗还处在其他地区大国构造的反伊联盟的威胁之下，对伊朗强势地位的恐惧把这些国家紧紧联合在一起。
If the West – America and Europe – act swiftly, decisively, and with a joint strategy, there remains a chance to stabilize the situation.	如果以美国和欧洲为代表的西方世界能够迅速、果断地采取联合行动，稳定地区局势也并非毫无希望。
But to achieve this, it will be necessary to offset, or at least balance, the interests of the most important actors in the region.	但要想达到目的，该地区内多数重要角色的利益必须相互抵消、最低限度也要达到暂时的平衡。
This means a strategy based on political leverage not a threat of military intervention or regime change.	这意味着必须以政治力量对比为基础来制定策略，而不是单纯依靠武力侵略或政权颠覆的军事威胁。
In their stead must come, on the one hand, direct talks, security guarantees, and support in political and economic integration.	相反，各国之间必须开展直接对话、提供安全保障、并支持政治和经济领域的相互融合。
To be successful, this strategy also requires a realistic threat of isolation of those who continue to undermine regional stability, as well as substantial progress in the Arab-Israeli conflict.	要想获得成功，这一策略还需要孤立破坏地区稳定的力量，并在阿以冲突中取得实质性的进展。
A new Middle East policy will thus have to concentrate primarily on four aspects: 1) a comprehensive offer to Syria to detach the country from Iran and settle open conflicts; 2) an offer to Iran for direct talks about the perspective of a full normalization of relations; 3) a decisive and realistic initiative to resolve the Israeli-Arab conflict 4) a regional security architecture that centers on stabilizing Iraq and Afghanistan.	因此，新的中东政策必须关注以下几个方面：1)向叙利亚提供脱离伊朗、解决现有争端的综合方案；2)为伊朗制定实现全面关系正常化的方案，提供直接谈判机会；3)制定解决阿以冲突的切实可行的果断计划；4)建立以稳定伊拉克和阿富汗局势为核心的地区安全构架。
	
What Now?	现在怎么办？
More Europe!	加强欧洲一体化！
The rejection of the European Union’s Constitution by French and Dutch voters forces us to think well beyond that treaty.	法国与荷兰对欧盟宪法的反对迫使我们开始好好考虑一些条约之外的问题。
That much is clear from the current debate on the Community budget.	这在目前有关共同体预算的辩论中毫无涉及。
The naysayers’ victories show that sovereignty-based arguments that oppose any kind of European political union are on the march.	反对者的胜利表明以基于主权、反对任何形式的欧洲政治联盟的辩论已经启动。
Euroskeptics, it seems, are gaining ground everywhere, and a kind of xenophobia is on the rise.	欧洲怀疑论者的队伍看来正在各地壮大，并且一种惧外主义也日渐抬头。
But xenophobia and sovereignty were not the primary impulses that propelled the “no” votes.	但是，惧外主义和主权并非推动否决票的主要因素。
Above all, the “no” votes in France and Holland – and rising discontent in other member states, such as Germany – are the result of the inability of national governments and the Union to respond effectively to the problems that most concern citizens.	首先，法国和荷兰的否决票 — — 以及在其他成员国内不断升温的不满情绪 — — 是国家政府以及欧盟对大多数民众关心的问题未能有效反应的结果。
Not only anti-Europeans rejected the constitution; far from it.	反对欧盟宪法的不仅仅是反欧洲主义者，远远不止他们。
Many Europeans are, in fact, calling on the EU to act to reduce unemployment and to intervene decisively in the international arena.	事实上，许多欧洲人都呼吁欧盟采取措施以降低失业率并在国际领域内要果敢介入。
Many interpreted Europe’s internal division over the war in Iraq, with ordinary citizens overwhelmingly opposed to military intervention, as a sign of the Union’s weakness.	许多人将当时普通民众强烈抗议军事介入情形下欧洲内部在伊拉克战争问题上的分歧看作欧盟无能的一个信号。
But the answer to such doubt and dismay is more Europe, not less.	但是要消除这些怀疑和沮丧情绪，办法就是加强欧洲一体化，而非削弱。
The European Council’s summit on June 16-17 should give a clear sign that it recognizes this.	6月16-17日举行的欧洲理事会峰会应该给出一个明确信号，表示理事会已经认识到了这一点。
Most supporters of the Constitution believe that it will not only help build a citizens’ Europe, but also create better conditions for European economic development, and for the EU to act globally.	大多数欧盟宪法的支持者们相信，这部宪法将不仅仅有助于建立一个欧洲公民们的欧洲，也将为欧洲经济发展以及欧盟的全球行动创造更好的条件。
They are right.	他们是正确的。
It would be imprudent to assume that the French and Dutch “no” votes were not about discontent with Union policies; but that anger was directed against the French and Dutch governments, not Europe itself.	假定法国和荷兰的反对票与他们对欧盟政策的不满毫无关系是草率的。 只是他们将愤怒矛头直指法国和荷兰政府而并非欧盟本身而已。
The fact is that citizens in every EU member country are increasingly aware that national policies are determined by decision making at the European level, over which they have little influence.	事实上，每个欧盟成员国的公民越来越意识到，他们的国家政策现在由欧洲级别的决策来决定，而他们对此几乎无法施加任何影响。
The European Constitution has little to do with this, but referenda are never confined to the actual questions put to voters.	欧盟宪法与此无甚关联，但是公民投票从不仅限于那些需要投票决定的实质问题。
Instead, they provide opportunities for citizens to express what they feel about the choices their governments make, particularly within the EU framework.	相反，它们为公民提供了机会来表达他们对政府所作选择的看法，尤其是在欧盟框架内的决定。
The 2004 elections for the European Parliament had already shown that the level of discontent with the Union was high.	2004年欧洲议会选举已经表现出了人们对欧盟的不满程度。
Voters heavily punished almost all national governments.	投票者狠狠惩罚了几乎所有政府。
Yet nobody thought that that election had changed the course of Europe.	然而没有人想到那场选举改变了欧盟的进程。
Above all, the French and Dutch referendums confirmed that politics in the Union is now conducted “on the street,” and that it is no longer possible to “construct” Europe at a distance and by stealth.	首先，法国和荷兰的公投证实了欧盟内的政治现在是“在大街上”进行的，再也不可能保持一定距离暗暗“建造”欧洲了。
This means that EU governments must respond to popular anxieties and make the Union more transparent and democratic.	这意味着欧盟各国政府必须对普遍的民众忧虑做出反应，并使欧盟变得更加透明民主。
This would be a lot easier with the Constitution in place, but there are measures that can and should be adopted now to make that possible.	如果我们手里有一部宪法，这就容易多了，但是我们还需要采取能够采取同时也是必要的措施，以使之成为可能。
First, the community budget should be structured so that it has a significant impact on growth and employment (a return to the voluntarism of the Delors Packages, now applied to the Lisbon Strategy).	首先，应当制定一份对经济增长和就业率具有重大影响的共同体预算方案（重回德罗尔的唯意志论，其现在正适用于里斯本战略）
Second, European governments must show a real commitment to act together.	其次，欧盟各国政府必须做出一致行动的实际承诺。
A key opportunity presents itself with the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona Declaration to define a common position to support democratic change in the Mediterranean by ceasing to back the political status quo there.	巴塞罗那宣言十周年纪念为他们提供了一个重要机会来达成对统一立场的共识，即通过停止支持地中海地区的政治现状来支持当地的民主改革。
Finally, Council meetings should be open when legislative matters are at stake, so that citizens can know who voted for what and according to which criteria.	最后，当立法无法奏效的时候，就应该召开欧盟理事会会议，这样公民们就能知道谁该根据哪种标准为什么投票。
All of this can be decided at the next European Council, even before the constitutional problem is resolved.	所有这些将在欧盟理事会下届会议中决定，甚至还赶在宪法问题解决之前。
This kind of action is more likely to win back a skeptical citizenry than any information campaign, however well designed.	这样的行动比起任何精心策划的宣传活动都更有可能赢回持怀疑态度的公民们。
At the same time, it is necessary to solve the Constitutional deadlock.	同时，我们必须化解宪法所陷入的僵局。
As already proposed by the Convention, this would mean separating constitutional matters per se from Union policy.	正如公约所提议，这意味着将宪法问题本身与欧盟政策分离开来。
The real innovations are found in Part I and II of the proposed Constitution, in the definition of the normative and political identity of the Union, its competences, the new institutional balance – including the creation of a European Minister of Foreign Affairs – and, last but not least, the introduction of a Bill of Rights.	我们在被提议的宪法中的第一和第二部分中发现了真正的革新内容，表现在对欧盟政治身份及标准身份、权限，新体制平衡的定义中 — — 包括产生一名欧洲外交部长 — — 最后但却十分重要的一点是，引入了权利法案。
The part that was actually rejected and raises the most concerns among citizens of the member States is in Part III, which focuses on Union policies such as the Common Market, competition policy and the Common Agricultural Policy.	真正遭到拒绝以及在成员国公民中引起最多忧虑的在第三部分中，该部分将重点放于诸如统一市场、竞争政策以及共同农业政策等欧盟政策上。
So the first and second parts could be ratified without new negotiations and could form the basis for the new Treaty, so that the Treaty of Nice would still apply; and the debate on the European social model would continue.	因此，第一和第二部分无须新辩论就可通过并能为形成新条约打下基础，因此尼斯条约将继续适用；并且有关欧洲社会模式的辩论将持续下去。
It is essential to reaffirm the normative essence of the Constitutional Treaty to protect the greatest achievement of the Constitutional Convention.	最基本的是要再次重申宪法条约的规范本质以保护宪法公约所取得的伟大成就。
Diversity and inclusiveness, through the integration of European democracies with a common project, remains Europe’s great gift to the world.	在一个共同方案下，通过欧洲民主体制一体化进程所达成的多样性和包容性，使欧洲得以保持它对这个世界的伟大贡献。
It is what has made Europe an “international public good” to use former Brazilian foreign minister Celso Lafer’s felicitous turn of phrase.	正是这，使欧洲成为一个使用巴西前外交部长塞尔索·拉弗（Celso Lafer）那及其精巧措辞的“国际公共产品 ” 。
Such a Europe is better placed to contribute to a fairer international order than the narrow, bitter Europe the xenophobes have in mind.	这样一个欧洲最好还是致力于维护更为公平的国际秩序，而不是成为惧外主义者所希望的那个狭隘刻薄的欧洲。
For Europe to remain a promise for the world, it must thrive as a public good for all its citizens.	若要维持它对全世界的承诺，欧洲必须作为一个为其所有公民谋利的公共产品而繁荣发展。
Europe and Europeans cannot wait for a new treaty to show that the Union is able to fulfill that promise.	欧洲和欧洲人都不能干等着一个新条约的出现来表明欧盟有能力履行那个承诺。
	
What Nuclear Energy Renaissance?	核能的“文艺复兴”从何而来？
ZURICH – Repeatedly in recent years there have been calls for a revival of civilian nuclear power.	发自苏黎世 — — 这几年来不断有人呼吁要重振民用核能的雄风。
Yet that renaissance never seems to come.	但在我看来，这么一场民用核能的“文艺复兴时代”似乎还远未到来。
Indeed, of the more than 200 countries in the world, only 30 use nuclear power.	事实上，全世界200多个国家中采用了核能的只有区区30国。
In July 2010, a total of 439 nuclear power plants with a net installed capacity of 373.038 GW(e) were connected to various national electricity grids, about 1.2 GW(e) more than at the beginning of 2006.	截止到2010年7月，全球总共有439座核电站投入运作，净装机容量达373.038吉瓦（GW(e ) ， 电力学单位，1吉瓦=10亿瓦）并实现了联网，较2006初又增加了1.2吉瓦。
Roughly 16% of total energy needs (up to 25% in the highly industrialized countries) are now met by electric energy.	全球大概有16%的能源需求（发达国家为25 % ） 是由电来提供的。
Nuclear fission’s contribution to total electric energy has decreased from about 18% more than ten years ago to about 14% in 2008.	而相比于1998年之间的18 % ， 核能所占的份额在2008年已经下降到了14 % 。
On a worldwide scale, nuclear energy is thus only a small component of the global energy mix, and its share, contrary to widespread belief, is not on the rise.	从全球角度上看，核能如今只能算是能源多样性中的一个小的组成部分，更出乎人们意料的是，其所占的份额也没有上升。
During 2009, for example, nuclear power plants provided 2,560 TWh(e) (2,560 billion kWh) of electric energy, about 1.6% lower than during 2008 and almost 4% lower than during the record year of 2006, when 2,658 TWh(e) were produced.	比如说在2009年，核电站提供了2560太瓦时（TWh(e ) ， 电力学单位，1太瓦时=10亿千瓦时）的电能，比2008年降低了1.6 % ， 更比2006年的2658太瓦时下降了近4 % 。
Early results for the first four months of 2010 for the OECD countries, collected by the International Energy Agency indicate that so far the 2010 results are as low or lower than during the last year.	从国际能源机构搜集的经合组织国家2010年1~4月核能发电数据来看，各月数据都与去年同期持平或更低。
During the next five years, on average, roughly 10 new nuclear reactors are expected to become operational every year. But this assumes that all of them are constructed according to schedule, and the nuclear industry has rarely met its promised construction deadlines.	在未来五年内预计每年会有大概10座新反应堆投入运行，但这要求所有建设都按期完工，而核能行业却经常是不守时的。
According to the World Nuclear Association (WNA), 17 new reactors should have become operational between 2007 and 2009. But only five came onstream during this period – three in 2007 and two in 2009.	依照世界核能组织的数据，2007~2009年间本该有17座新反应堆投入运行，谁知最后只有5座得以发电 — — 2007年3座，2009年两座。
Moreover, four reactors were de-commissioned during 2009, and a larger number of reactors in Japan and Germany are not in use, owing to various technical stoppages.	此外，还有4座反应堆于2009年退役，日本和德国都有相当数量的反应堆由于各种技术原因而处于闲置状态。
At least one hundred older and smaller reactors will most likely be closed over the next 10-15 years.	在未来10到15年内，至少会有100座旧式或小型反应堆停止运行。
Furthermore, during the past 10 years, only about two-thirds of worldwide demand for nuclear fuel – about 68,000 tons of natural uranium equivalent are needed for 2010 – was met from resources obtained from mining.	更重要的是在过去10年间，铀矿的开采只能满足全世界核能发电燃料总需求量的2/3 — — 2010年度需求量约为6.8万当量吨天然铀。
The remaining 20,000 tons came from so-called secondary uranium sources – mainly inventories held by utilities and governments, re-processed nuclear fuel, and stockpiles of depleted uranium.	而剩下的2万当量吨缺口就由所谓的“二次铀资源”来满足 — — 主要是一些公营机构和政府的库存，再加工的核燃料以及贫化铀储藏。
The supply from these sources will drop by roughly 10,000 tons at the end of 2013, when the Megatons to Megawatt Program between Russia and the United States – which recycles highly-enriched uranium from Russian nuclear warheads into low-enriched uranium for nuclear power plants – comes to an end.	但上述这类物资的储备量将在2013年末下降到约1万吨，因为那时美俄两国之间的“兆吨到兆瓦”项目（回收俄罗斯核弹头的高浓缩铀并将其转化为民用发电的低浓缩铀）就走到尽头了。
Current projections indicate that uranium shortages in the coming years can be avoided only if existing and new uranium mines operate according to plan.	照目前的预测，未来铀资源短缺问题的解决只能依靠现有及新铀矿的按步骤开采。
Indeed, extrapolations of global supply that foresee an increase in uranium mining are based on claims about the ability to expand output in Kazakhstan.	事实上，当前对铀开采量增加的预期都是基于哈萨克斯坦的产能提升。
So far, uranium mining in Kazakhstan has increased roughly as expected, from 4,357 tons in 2005 to 8,521 tons in 2008 to 14,000 tons in 2009.	而迄今为止该地的铀矿产量增长都与预期相符，从2005年的4357当量吨到2008年的8521当量吨，再到2009年的1.4万当量吨。
But it remains to be seen if the uranium mining in this country can indeed increase further to 18,000 tons in 2010 and to 30,000 tons by 2018.	但该国铀矿产量是否能在2010年和2018年分别达到1.8万和3万当量吨？ 这还有待观察。
According to the WNA’s latest estimates, from July 2010, the expected uranium extraction figure for 2010 has actually been decreased to 15,000 tons.	按照世界核能组织的最新估算，从2010年7月开始，哈萨克斯坦的铀矿预计开采量将下降到1.5万吨。
The view that the amount of energy derived from nuclear power worldwide will continue its slow decrease during the coming years is further supported by the 2008 annual report of the Euratom Supply Agency, which coordinates the long-term uranium needs of nuclear power plants within the European Union.	全球核能发电量将在未来持续走低的观点也在欧洲原子能共同体供应机构（Euratom Supply Agency，负责协调欧盟境内各国核电站的长期铀需求）的2008年报中得到了印证。
According to the agency’s forecast, uranium demand in Europe will fall from 21,747 tons in 2010 to 17,378 tons by 2018 and roughly 16,000 tons by 2024.	据该机构估计，欧洲铀资源需求量将从2010年的2.1747万当量吨下降到2018年的1.7378当量吨，最终降低到2024年的约1.6万当量吨。
These numbers indicate that the EU, currently producing about 1/3 of the world’s nuclear electric energy, is heading for a reduction in nuclear-energy production of up to 20% over the coming 10 years.	这些数字显示欧盟 — — 这个目前占全球核能发电量1/3的区域 — — 有在未来十年内减少20%核能发电量的趋势。
One can also expect that the current worldwide economic crisis will not help to accelerate the construction of nuclear power plants and new uranium mines.	人们也同样可以预计当前的全球经济危机也无法加速反应堆的建设和新铀矿的开采。
In summary, the hard facts about nuclear energy are inconsistent with the possibility of a worldwide renaissance of nuclear energy.	总而言之，这些令人皱眉的数据都与核能的“文艺复兴”背道而驰。
Indeed, they point toward a continuing slow phase-out of civilian nuclear energy in most of the large OECD countries.	事实上，这些数据意味着在大多数经合组织大国，民用核能都将被逐步淘汰。
It thus seems unavoidable that energy consumers, especially in many rich countries, will have to learn to exchange their current worries about the distant future consequences of global warming for the reality of energy shortages during periods of peak demand.	而对于（尤其是富裕国家）的能源消费者来说，他们无可避免地要学会将自己对那些全球变暖的遥不可及的后果的忧虑，转化成用电高峰期能源短缺的现实认识。
Such shortages could result either in chaotic supplies and power outages or in a coordinated policy of energy rationing.	这些短缺要么将可能导致能源的混乱供应以及短缺，要么就是能源配给制度。
In the absence of nuclear-energy revival, most of us will be forced to reduce our direct energy consumption.	在核能复兴无望的情况下，大多数人将被迫减少自己的直接能源消费。
Let us hope that we can learn to adapt to simpler – though perhaps still satisfying – lifestyles.	让我们期望自己能适应那种更简单 — — 或许也同样舒适 — — 的生活方式吧。
	
What Reset Button?	重设按钮，什么重设按钮？
MOSCOW – The emergence of a Kremlin leader, President Dmitri Medvedev, without a KGB background, combined with the economic crisis, has inspired talk that when Barack Obama visits Moscow, America’s president will be seeing a country on the verge of a new political thaw, a revived perestroika .	发自莫斯科 — — 作为一个没有克格勃背景的克里姆林宫领导人，迪米特里·梅德韦杰夫总统的成功崛起在加上经济危机的影响，令外界不禁猜测当美国总统奥巴马正式踏上莫斯科之行时，呈现在美国人眼中的俄罗斯会是一个政治桎梏即将解禁的国度，一个重焕改革之光的国度。
But pushing the “re-set button” on US-Russia relations may be harder than Obama and his team imagined.	但对奥巴马和他的团队来说，启动全新美俄关系的“重设按钮”可比他们想象中要更难触动。
Russian (or Soviet) leaders opt for perestroika or a thaw only when forced to do so by dire conditions that threaten the regime’s survival.	事实上，俄罗斯（或者苏联）领导人只会在情况已经糟糕到威胁其生存的情况下才会选择改革。
An atmosphere of mortal fear, mutual suspicion, and hatred among the Communist elite was the catalyst for Nikita Khrushchev’s post-Stalin thaw.	前苏联领导人尼基塔·赫鲁晓夫在斯大林死后的改革就是由共产体制内精英之间的极端恐惧，互相猜忌和仇恨来作为改革催化剂的。
For Mikhail Gorbachev in the 1980’s, the catalyst for his perestroika was the USSR’s growing economic paralysis.	而对于1980年代的米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫来说，改革的催化剂则是苏联不断恶化的经济瘫痪局面。
For both men, the goal of clinging to power was a top priority.	对于上述两位领导人来说，想方设法攀附权力才是其首要目标。
Changing the system and easing their grip on power was a risky move that could undermine their authority.	而改革整个政治系统以及放松对权力的掌控则是一个极可能动摇其权威的危险行动。
But the risks of inertia seemed to be even higher. In the end, having opted for change, both were forced to leave their posts prematurely, against their will.	但整个政治系统的行为惯性似乎比他们的权力更强大，以致这两个迷恋权力的最高领导人最后都被过早地赶下了台。
As he revived centralized Kremlin control over Russian politics and public affairs, Vladimir Putin has been concerned primarily with minimizing challenges to state power, which he concentrated in his own hands.	而当弗拉基米尔·普京重新把决定俄罗斯政治和公共事务的大权集中在克里姆林宫的宫墙之内时，他的首要考虑则是如何把各方对他手中中央权力的挑战最小化。
To this end, he stripped the political system of competition, emasculated state institutions, marginalized the opposition, and basically eliminated public participation.	于是他废除了竞争性的政治体制，弱化国家机构的作用，排斥反对派并从根本上将公众屏蔽在政治生活之外。
His power-building project was facilitated by high oil prices, but came at the cost of a steady deterioration in the quality of governance and abandonment of the goal of modernization.	他的权力建构计划在高油价的帮助下大功告成，但却付出了政府管治水平不断下滑而国家现代化目标迟迟未能实现的代价。
With policymaking fully nontransparent and reduced to a very closed circle, and implementation delegated to an unaccountable bureaucracy, the inevitable result of Putin’s political model was pervasive corruption.	由于政府决策程序极端不透明且小圈子作业，而政策执行的任务又委派给了不可靠的官僚机构，因为普京政治模式所无法避免的结果就是深层次和大面积的腐败。
The desire to avoid public discontent and ensure social stability led to a suspension of reform.	与此同时对公众不满的压制和一定要保持社会稳定的思维则导致整个改革进程停滞不前。
Instead of creating incentives that would unleash public energies, the government pushed citizens farther and farther from politics and policymaking, thereby deepening social apathy and atomization.	对此政府不但没有设法去释放公众参与政治生活的能量，反而不断把公众与政治和政策制订领域隔离得越来越远，并因此加深了社会冷漠和分散化。
Moreover, the opportunity provided by the oil boom was wasted.	此外由高油价带来的改革契机则被浪费殆尽。
Indeed, today Russia risks lagging even further behind the developed countries.	事实上今天的俄罗斯已经面临着被发达国家抛离得越来越远的危险。
Its economy remains undiversified and uncompetitive, and its contribution to global technological progress is minuscule.	其国内经济结构单一而且缺乏竞争力，而对全球技术进步的贡献甚至微不足道。
Worse still, economic growth based on exports of natural resources has proved unsustainable.	更严重的是，通过出口自然资源来支撑的经济发展已被证明是不可靠的。
When oil prices were high and growing, the government could compensate for poor performance by throwing money at problems.	当油价保持在高位并不端攀升之时，政府可以通过大洒金钱来掩盖低劣的执政能力。
Today, with oil prices dramatically reduced, this largesse is no longer available, and economic experts agree that the growth potential of Russia’s petro-economy has been exhausted.	而在今时今日油价戏剧性回落之后，这种慷慨疏财之举就再也行不通了。 经济专家们更一致认为，俄罗斯石油经济的发展潜力已经被过早地耗尽了。
Despite all this, the situation is not sufficiently dire to push Russia’s leaders to open at least some channels of genuine public participation and yield any of their power.	但即便如此，情况还是没有坏到要让俄罗斯领导人对民众开放哪怕寥寥几条参与政治的渠道并下放权力的地步。
The price of oil, at around $70 a barrel, may be half of what it was a year ago, but up from around $40 earlier this year.	目前70美元一桶的原油价格可能只是一年前的一半，但至少也比年初的40美元一桶有所提升了。
Nor does the Russian economy’s contraction and the expected deepening of poverty (the World Bank’s report released in late June was grimmer about Russia than its previous report) presage an immediate catastrophe.	而即便俄罗斯正面临着经济紧缩和贫困问题恶化（世界银行在6月底发布的报告对俄罗斯的评语也比前几份要更为严厉 ） ， 这也并不预示着改革的催化剂将立刻到来。
And, unlike in the late 1980’s and 1990’s, Russia is not indebted to foreign banks or international organizations, though it plans to resume foreign borrowing next year.	即便政府有计划在明年恢复向外国借贷，但当今的俄罗斯也几经不像上世纪80，90年代那样背负着外国银行或者国际组织的债务了。
So the government will prefer to muddle through the crisis, rather than risk any decisive reform.	因此政府会想方设法在危机中蒙混过关，而不是冒险去做出决定性的改革。
The goal of clinging to power remains the priority, and risk-aversion the main guideline.	对于官员来来说，攀附权力依然是最高要务，而逃避风险也是照样是重要的行事原则。
The ruling elite are known to be torn by disputes and rivalries.	而统治精英阶层也被争吵和敌意所分裂。
Just recently, two of Putin’s deputies gave interviews to two Western media outlets offering what sounded like starkly opposite visions for Russia’s development.	就在最近，普京的两个副手分别接受两家西方媒体的采访，谁知两人却对俄罗斯的未来发展提出了针锋相对的观点。
But such disputes never spill over into the broad public sphere; members of the elite are primarily concerned about social and political stability and would not stir the public by seeking support for an alternative policy course.	但这种争端可不会被扩散到民众中间去；因为精英们也都小心翼翼地维持着社会和政治的稳定，断然不会为了某个其他的政治进程就贸然挑动民众。
These delaying tactics are enabled by a lack of pressure from below.	由于缺乏来自社会底层的压力，这些拖延战术也凑效了。
Russians may be concerned by growing unemployment and reduced incomes, but this is not manifesting itself in any drive to organize or try to effect political change.	俄罗斯人大都关注失业和收入减少的问题，但这并不意味着他们就有动力去组织起来并试图影响政治变革。
The public below, just like the leaders above, cherish political stability; the popularity ratings of both Prime Minister Putin and President Dmitri Medvedev remain above 70%.	跟上层领导一样，下层的公众也极为珍视政治稳定的局面，以至于普京总理和梅德韦杰夫总统的公众支持度都双双维持在70%以上。
Disgruntlement over the increasingly authoritarian governance may be common among business circles, elements of the neutered political opposition, liberal intellectuals, and even part of the bureaucracy.	而对独裁政治的不满可能也存在于商界、中立的政治反对派、自由派知识分子甚至一部分官僚的意识当中。
But these forces are too timid and fragmented, with no drive for political action.	但这些力量太过懦弱和分散，同时也缺乏发动政治行动的动机。
The current government’s tactic of muddling through without changing the political system or the structure of the economy is fraught with the risk of gradual decline.	在不改变政治系统或者经济结构的情况下，当今政府试图混过危机的策略使俄罗斯面临着逐步衰落的危险。
To the Kremlin’s rulers, this may seem an acceptable cost for retaining power, but postponing reform will only aggravate Russia’s countless problems.	对于那些克里姆林宫的当权者来说，这可能是为保住权力而付出的必要代价，但推迟改革只能令国内的诸多问题更加恶化。
Besides, muddling through may prove unaffordable even in the short run, if oil prices decline again.	这种蒙混策略甚至在短期看来都难以维持，因为油价又再次走低了。
A dramatic curtailment of state resources may eventually push the government toward modernization, but it might also produce an uglier shift— toward harder political crackdown, economic nationalism and an essentially isolationist course.	而政府手中资源的大幅度缩减可能最终将政府推上改革之路，但这也可能导致更可怕的蜕变 — — 一连串更强力的政治高压，经济国有化和孤立主义政策。
This would be catastrophic for Russia— to say nothing of relations with the US.	这对于俄罗斯来说堪称灾难性的 — — 而美国重启两国关系的期望，换来的可能只是沉默。
	
What Role for the State?	国家能承担什么角色？
WASHINGTON, DC – The financial crisis of 2008 has spurred a global debate on how much government regulation of markets – and what kind – is appropriate.	发自华盛顿特区 — — 2008年的金融危机触发了一个关于政府应当对市场进行何种程度 — — 以及何种形式 — — 的监管才算恰当的全球讨论。
In the United States, it is a key theme in the upcoming presidential election, and it is shaping politics in Europe and emerging markets as well.	而这一点既是在美国总统大选临近的核心主题，还左右着欧洲和新兴市场的政治形势。
For starters, China’s impressive growth performance over the last three decades has given the world an economically successful example of what many call “state capitalism.”	首先，中国过去30年令人瞩目的增长表现塑造了一个被许多人称之为“国家资本主义”的成功经济范本。
Brazil’s development policies have also accorded a strong role to the state.	另一方面巴西的发展政策同时也与国家的强势角色相得益彰。
Questions concerning the state’s size and the sustainable role of government are central to the debate over the eurozone’s fate as well.	关于国家规模以及政府会否继续存在的问题也是欧元区命运讨论的核心议题。
Many critics of Europe, particularly in the US, link the euro crisis to the outsize role of government there, though the Scandinavian countries are doing well, despite high public spending.	虽然高公共支出的斯堪的纳维亚半岛国家都表现不错，但许多对欧洲的批评（尤其是来自于美国）都将欧元危机归咎于政府规模的过度膨胀。
In France, the new center-left government faces the challenge of delivering on its promise of strengthening social solidarity while substantially reducing the budget deficit.	在法国，新上台的中左翼政府也面临着挑战：一方面要兑现自己增强社会团结的承诺，另一方面又得持续减少预算赤字。
Alongside the mostly economic arguments about the role of government, many countries are experiencing widespread disillusionment with politics and a growing distance between citizens and government (particularly national government).	除了主要集中在经济层面上的对政府角色的争论之外，许多国家都在经历着民众对政治的大规模幻灭以及民众和政府（尤其是国家政府）之间不断增大的距离感。
In many countries, participation rates in national elections are falling, and new parties and movements, such as the Pirate Party in Germany and the Five Star Movement in Italy, reflect strong discontent with existing governance.	在许多国家，全国大选的参与率不断下降，而新的党派和运动，例如德国的海盗党（Pirate Party）和意大利的五星运动（Five Star Movement）都反映出人们对当前政府的极度不满。
In the US, the approval rating of Congress is at a record-low of 14%.	在美国，对国会的满意率已经跌落到了创纪录的14 % 。
Many there, such as my colleague Bruce Katz at the Brookings Institution, believe that the only solution is to bring a larger share of governance and policy initiation to the state and municipal level, in close partnership with the private sector and civil society.	许多美国人，例如我在布鲁金斯学会的同事布鲁斯·凯特兹（Bruce Katz ） ， 都相信唯一的解决方案就是给予州和市级层面更多的治理和政策动议，并与私人部门和公民社会建立紧密的伙伴关系。
But that approach, too, might have a downside.	但这种做法其实也有不足之处。
Consider Spain, where too much fiscal decentralization to regional governments contributed significantly to weakening otherwise strong public finances.	以西班牙为例，对地方政府的过度财政分权也大大削弱了在其他方面非常强大的公共财政。
A crucial problem for this global debate is that, despite the realities of twenty-first-century technology and globalization, it is still conducted largely as if governance and public policy were almost exclusively the domain of the nation-state.	在21世纪的技术进步和全球化背景下，这场全球讨论中依然存在着一个关键问题，那就是在讨论过程中似乎依然在很大程度上将治理和公共政策视为民族国家的专属地盘。
To adapt the debate to the real challenges that we face, we should focus on four levels of governance and identify the most appropriate allocation of public-policy functions to them.	而如果要让这场辩论与我们面临的真正挑战相适应的话，就应当把焦点集中在治理的四个层面上，并针对各个层面制定出最适合的公共政策职能分配方案。
First, many policies – including support for local infrastructure, land zoning, facilitation of industrial production and training, traffic ordinances, and environmental regulations – can largely be determined at the local or metropolitan level and reflect the wishes of a local electorate.	首先，许多政策 — — 包括对地方基础设施，土地划分，对工业生产和训练的扶助，交通条例以及环境监管的支持 — — 可以在很大程度上交由地方或是市级层面决定，并体现出本地选民的智慧。
Of course, defense and foreign policy will continue to be conducted primarily at the second level – the nation-state.	当然，国防和外交政策将依然由第二个层面（民族国家）来决定。
Most nation-states maintain national currencies, and must therefore pursue fiscal and economic policies that support a monetary union.	大多数民族国家都保有本国货币，并因此必须寻求能维护一个货币联盟的一系列财政和经济政策。
As the eurozone crisis has starkly reminded us, decentralization cannot extend too far into the budgetary sphere, lest it threaten the common currency’s survival.	但欧元区危机也明确提醒我们，权力下放不能过度延伸到预算领域，不然就会影响到共同货币的生存。
The US system is manageable, because the American states are largely constrained to running balanced budgets, while the federal government accounts for most fiscal policy.	美国的体系可以做到这一点，因为各州都在很大程度上被强制保持预算平衡，而联邦政府则为大部分财政政策负责。
Moreover, banking regulation and deposit insurance are centralized in the US, as they must be in a monetary union.	此外，美国的银行监管和存款保险都被收归联邦，因为它们必须存在于一个货币联盟之中。
The eurozone has finally recognized this.	欧元区最终也意识到了这一点。
So, governance at the nation-state level remains hugely important and is intimately linked to monetary sovereignty.	因此，在民族国家层面的治理依然非常重要而且与货币主权息息相关。
The key problem in Europe today is whether eurozone members will advance towards something resembling a federal nation-state.	但当今欧洲的关键问题��是各欧元区成员国是否会继续往前迈进，组成一个类似联邦民族国家的政体。
Unless they do, it is difficult to see how the common currency can survive.	除非他们能做到这一点，否则共同货币的生存就将面临极大困难。
There is also a third, regional or continental, level of governance, which is most advanced in the European Union (and is being tested in Latin America, Africa, and Asia) and can be very useful.	第三个层面的治理则是区域或者洲层面，这点在欧盟中最为深入，也在拉美，非洲和亚洲进行过相关测试，而且可以非常有用。
Customs unions, free-trade areas, or a single market, as in Europe, allow greater mobility of goods and services, which can lead to benefits from economies of scale that remaining trade impediments at the global level do not permit.	像欧洲那样的海关联盟，自由贸易区或者单一市场都可以使货物和服务获得更大的流动性，从而在依然存在贸易壁垒的全球层面上不允许的规模经济上得到好处。
Europe’s borderless Schengen Area is another example of regional supra-national governance.	欧洲无国界的申根区就是超国家治理的另一个例子。
There are also aspects of infrastructure that can best be addressed at the continental level.	而某些基础设施也能在洲际层面上进行更好的选址。
Finally, there is the global level.	最后就是全球层面。
The spread of infectious disease, global trade and finance, climate change, nuclear non-proliferation, counterterrorism, and cyber security are just some of the issues that require broad international cooperation and global governance.	流行病、全球贸易金融、气候变化、核不扩散，反恐以及网络安全都是一些需要进行广泛国际合作以及全球治理的事务。
In today’s interdependent world, the debate about the role of public policy, the size and functions of government, and the legitimacy of public decision-making should be conducted with the four levels of governance much more clearly in focus.	在当今这个互相依存的世界上，针对公共政策所扮演角色，政府的规模与职能，以及公共决策制定的合法性的讨论应当在这四个治理层面被更加清晰聚焦的情况下进行。
The levels often will overlap (infrastructure and clean energy issues, for example), but democracy could be greatly strengthened if the issues were linked to the levels at which decisions can best be taken.	这些层面往往会发生重叠（比如说基础设施和洁净能源事务 ） ， 但如果这些事务可以与那些能更好地执行决策的层面相联系的话，民主就能得到大大加强。
As Pascal Lamy, the director of the World Trade Organization, has said, it is not only the “local” that has to be brought to the “global”; the inherently “local” political sphere has to internalize the global or regional context.	正如世界贸易组织总干事帕斯卡尔·拉米（Pascal Lamy）所说，不仅仅是必须将“地方”推向“全球 ” ； 依附在内的“地方”政治领域也必须融入到全球或者区域的大背景下。
That is a huge challenge for political leadership and communication, but, if it is not met, democracy and globalization will be difficult to reconcile.	这对政治领导力和沟通交流都是极大的挑战，但如果无法应对这一点挑战的话，民主和全球化就难以协调一致。
How to conduct democratic debate with reference to these local, national, continental, and global levels, and to structure a political space that better reflects economic and social space, will be the great challenge of the decades ahead.	如何在提及这些地方，国家，洲和全球层面的情况下进行讨论，如何并构建一个更好地体现经济和社会空间的政治空间，都将成为未来数十年内的重大挑战。
	
What’s Holding Back the World Economy?	是什么在阻碍世界经济？
NEW YORK – Seven years after the global financial crisis erupted in 2008, the world economy continued to stumble in 2015.	发自纽约 — — 全球金融危机在2008年爆发七年后的2015年，世界经济依然萎靡。
According to the United Nations’ report World Economic Situation and Prospects 2016, the average growth rate in developed economies has declined by more than 54% since the crisis.	根据联合国发布的《2016年世界经济形势与展望》报告，自危机以来发达经济体的平均增长率下降了超过54 ％ 。
An estimated 44 million people are unemployed in developed countries, about 12 million more than in 2007, while inflation has reached its lowest level since the crisis.	据估计这些国家现有约4400万失业人口，较2007年多了1200万，而通胀则已经下探到自危机以来的最低水平。
More worryingly, advanced countries’ growth rates have also become more volatile.	更令人担忧的，发达国家的增长速度也变得更为不稳定。
This is surprising, because, as developed economies with fully open capital accounts, they should have benefited from the free flow of capital and international risk sharing – and thus experienced little macroeconomic volatility.	这是有点出人意料，因为这些完全开放资本账户的经济体本应从资本的自由流动和国际风险分担中获益 — — 并因此只会经历小范围的宏观经济波动。
Furthermore, social transfers, including unemployment benefits, should have allowed households to stabilize their consumption.	此外，包括失业救济金在内的各类社会转移支付手段应该​​也可依然让家庭维持自身的消费水平。
But the dominant policies during the post-crisis period – fiscal retrenchment and quantitative easing (QE) by major central banks – have offered little support to stimulate household consumption, investment, and growth. On the contrary, they have tended to make matters worse.	但在后危机时期的主要政策 — — 各大中央银行的财政紧缩和定量宽松 — — 在刺激居民消费，投资和增长方面没有多大帮助，反而让事态变得更加糟糕。
In the US, quantitative easing did not boost consumption and investment partly because most of the additional liquidity returned to central banks’ coffers in the form of excess reserves.	在美国，量化宽松政策未能刺激消费和投资的部分原因是大部分额外流动性都以超额准备金的形式回到了中央银行的金库。
The Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006, which authorized the Federal Reserve to pay interest on required and excess reserves, thus undermined the key objective of QE.	2006年的《金融服务管制放松法案》授权美国联邦储备委员会为法定和超额准备金支付利息，从而削弱了量化宽松的主要目标。
Indeed, with the US financial sector on the brink of collapse, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 moved up the effective date for offering interest on reserves by three years, to October 1, 2008. As a result, excess reserves held at the Fed soared, from an average of $200 billion during 2000-2008 to $1.6 trillion during 2009-2015.	事实上，在美国金融业濒临崩溃之时 ， 《 紧急经济稳定法案》将提供储备利率的生效日期提前了三年，从2008年10月1日开始，结果美联储持有的超额准备金额暴增，从2000~2008年间平均2000亿美元上升到2009~2015年间的1.6万亿。
Financial institutions chose to keep their money with the Fed instead of lending to the real economy, earning nearly $30 billion – completely risk-free – during the last five years.	金融机构选择把自己的钱留在美联储而非向实体经济贷款，收并因此在过去五年间无风险套利近300亿美元。
This amounts to a generous – and largely hidden – subsidy from the Fed to the financial sector.	这相当于美联储向金融部门给与了一个慷慨的 — — 而且在很大程度上隐蔽的 — — 补贴。
And, as a consequence of the Fed’s interest-rate hike last month, the subsidy will increase by $13 billion this year.	同时由于上个月美联储加息，今年的补贴还会增加约130亿美元。
Perverse incentives are only one reason that many of the hoped-for benefits of low interest rates did not materialize.	负面激励措施只是导致低利率的预期好处无法兑现的其中一个原因。
Given that QE managed to sustain near-zero interest rates for almost seven years, it should have encouraged governments in developed countries to borrow and invest in infrastructure, education, and social sectors. Increasing social transfers during the post-crisis period would have boosted aggregate demand and smoothed out consumption patterns.	由于量化宽松在接近七年间维持了近零利率，它本应鼓励各发达国家政府借贷并投资于基础设施，教育和社会部门，在后危机时期增加社会转移支付，提振总需求并将原本扭曲的消费模式理顺过来。
Moreover, the UN report clearly shows that, throughout the developed world, private investment did not grow as one might have expected, given ultra-low interest rates.	此外，联合国报告清楚地表明，在整个发达世界，民间投资并未像人们所认定的那样在超低利率下扩大。
In 17 of the 20 largest developed economies, investment growth remained lower during the post-2008 period than in the years prior to the crisis; five experienced a decline in investment during 2010-2015.	20个最大的发达经济体中有17个在2008年后投资增速低于危机前水平; 5个国家在2010~2015年间出现了投资总额下跌。
Globally, debt securities issued by non-financial corporations – which are supposed to undertake fixed investments – increased significantly during the same period.	全球范围内，本应转化为固定资产投资的非金融企业债券的发行量在同一时期显著上升。
Consistent with other evidence, this implies that many non-financial corporations borrowed, taking advantage of the low interest rates. But, rather than investing, they used the borrowed money to buy back their own equities or purchase other financial assets.	这跟与其他众多证据一致表明，许多非金融企业只是以低利率的优势来借款，不过目的不是投资，而是用借来的钱回购自己的股票或购买其他金融资产。
QE thus stimulated sharp increases in leverage, market capitalization, and financial-sector profitability.	因此量化宽松政策反而大幅提升了杠杆率，市场资本化程度和金融部门的盈利。
But, again, none of this was of much help to the real economy.	但这一切同样都对实体经济没有多大帮助。
Clearly, keeping interest rates at the near zero level does not necessarily lead to higher levels of credit or investment.	显然，保持利率在接零水平并不一定会催生更高水平的信贷或投资。
When banks are given the freedom to choose, they choose riskless profit or even financial speculation over lending that would support the broader objective of economic growth.	当银行被赋予自由选择的权利时，它们宁愿选择无风险利润甚至金融投机，而非把款贷出去以支持更宏观的经济增长目标。
By contrast, when the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund lends cheap money to developing countries, it imposes conditions on what they can do with it.	相反，当世界银行或国际货币基金组织把廉价资金出借给发展中国家的时候，它们都会规定贷款的用途。
To have the desired effect, QE should have been accompanied not only by official efforts to restore impaired lending channels (especially those directed at small- and medium-size enterprises), but also by specific lending targets for banks.	如果要收到预期的效果，伴随着量化宽松政策的不应仅有政府恢复受损贷款渠道（特别是那些针对中小规模的企业）的努力，还有对银行贷款的具体目标。
Instead of effectively encouraging banks not to lend, the Fed should have been penalizing banks for holding excess reserves.	相对于适得其反地激励银行不放贷，美联储应该已经处罚那些存入超额准备金的银行。
While ultra-low interest rates yielded few benefits for developed countries, they imposed significant costs on developing and emerging-market economies.	而超低利率虽然对发达国家无甚好处，它却对发展中国家和新兴市场经济体强加了巨大的成本。
An unintended, but not unexpected, consequence of monetary easing has been sharp increases in cross-border capital flows.	这个并非政策制定者本意却是意料之中的后果就是货币宽松政策导致跨境资本流动急剧增加。
Total capital inflows to developing countries increased from about $20 billion in 2008 to over $600 billion in 2010.	流入发展中国家的总资本从2008年的约2000亿美元增加到2010年的超过6000亿。
At the time, many emerging markets had a hard time managing the sudden surge of capital flows. Very little of it went to fixed investment.	与此同时，许多新兴市场都难以应对资本流动的突然激增，这些资金中也只有很少的一部分转化为固定资产投资。
In fact, investment growth in developing countries slowed significantly during the post crisis period.	事实上，发展中国家的投资增长在后危机时期显著放缓。
This year, developing countries, taken together, are expected to record their first net capital outflow – totaling $615 billion – since 2006.	今年以来，发展中国家整体将经历自2006年以来首次资本净流出的局面 — — 金额共计达6150亿美元。
Neither monetary policy nor the financial sector is doing what it’s supposed to do.	无论是货币政策还是财政部门都未能履行自己的职责。
It appears that the flood of liquidity has disproportionately gone toward creating financial wealth and inflating asset bubbles, rather than strengthening the real economy.	显然泛滥的流动性中的极大部分都朝着创造金融财富和催生资产泡沫奔去，而非巩固实体经济。
Despite sharp declines in equity prices worldwide, market capitalization as a share of world GDP remains high.	尽管全球股价大幅下跌，市场资本占世界GDP的份额仍然很高。
The risk of another financial crisis cannot be ignored.	爆发另一场金融危机的风险也不容忽视。
There are other policies that hold out the promise of restoring sustainable and inclusive growth.	还有其他一些政策也在支撑着恢复可持续和包容性增长承诺的兑现。
These begin with rewriting the rules of the market economy to ensure greater equality, more long-term thinking, and reining in the financial market with effective regulation and appropriate incentive structures.	这些政策首先由改写市场经济的规则开始，以确保更高程度的平等，更长远考虑，并用有效的监管和适当的激励机制来管理金融市场。
But large increases in public investment in infrastructure, education, and technology will also be needed.	但是也有必要大幅加大在基础设施，教育和科技方面的公共投资。
These will have to be financed, at least in part, by the imposition of environmental taxes, including carbon taxes, and taxes on the monopoly and other rents that have become pervasive in the market economy – and contribute enormously to inequality and slow growth.	而这些投资的资金，至少部分地，都可以通过包括碳税在内的环境税，以及对已经在市场经济中产生负面效应的 — — 并极大催生不平等状况和低增长 — — 的垄断以及其他租金征税来筹集。
The views expressed here do not reflect the views of the United Nations or its member states.	本文观点并不反映联合国及其会员国的意见。
	
What Should Bretton Woods II Look Like?	布雷顿森林体系II看起来应该是什么样子？
NEW YORK – For those of us who have long claimed that the world’s international financial architecture needed deep reform, the call for a “Bretton Woods II” is welcome.	纽约－对我们当中长期以来声称国际金融体系需要进行深刻改革的人来说，布雷顿森林体系II的倡议是很受欢迎的。
Of course, similar calls were made after the Asian and Russian crises of 1997-1998, but were not taken seriously by the rich industrial countries.	当然，在1997年到1998年的亚洲和俄罗斯危机以后，有人提出了类似的倡议，但是这些倡议都没有得到富裕工业国家的认真对待。
Now that these countries are at the center of the storm, perhaps they will now be serious.	当前，这些富裕的工业国家处在金融风暴的中心地带，或许它们现在会对这个倡议认真起来。
Two fundamental problems exist with the call for reform.	当前，进行国际金融体系改革的呼吁存在两个基本问题。
First, it lacks content: it is unclear what any eventual Bretton Woods II discussions will be about.	首先，它缺乏内容：最终的布雷顿森林体系II要讨论什么，还不清楚。
Second, the process started the wrong way, by excluding most countries from the talks.	其次，这个过程是以将绝大多数国家排除在会谈之外的错误方式开始的。
It is obviously good for the G-7 or a subset of G-7 members to show leadership, but no fundamental reform can occur without an inclusive process that gives both industrial and developing countries, and both large and small countries an adequate voice.	显然，对G-7或G-7的一部分成员国来说，这对显示它们的领导地位是有好处的，但是，在没有给予工业国家以及发展中国家，大国以及小国足够的发言权的 包含过程 的情况下，根本性的改革是不可能出现的。
Global institutions, not ad hoc groups of countries, must be at the center of the reform effort.	是全球性机构，而不是是临时性的国家集团，是国际金融体系改革活动的中心。
The clearest issue right now is correcting the deficit of regulations that characterizes global financial markets.	现在，最明确的问题是要纠正全球金融市场表现出来的监管缺位。
Discussion must start by agreeing on regulatory principles .	改革全球金融体系的讨论应该以同意监管原则为开端。
An obvious one is that regulations must be comprehensive, to avoid the massive loopholes that led to the current turmoil.	一个显而易见的原则是监管必须全面，以避免产生导致当前的金融动荡的大量漏洞。
Regulations should also have a strong counter-cyclical focus, preventing excessive accumulation of leverage and increasing capital and provisions (reserves) during booms, as well as preventing asset price bubbles from feeding into credit expansion.	监管也应该具有很强的抗周期关注点，以便在繁荣时期防止金融杠杆的过渡累计，并且增加资本和供应（储备 ） ， 同时防止资产泡沫助长信贷扩张。
Reliance on financial institutions’ internal models, the major focus of the Basel II agreement on banking regulation, should be discarded.	有关银行监管的巴塞尔协议II，其主要的观点是要依靠金融机构的内部模型，现在应该抛弃这种观点。
That strategy has now been exposed as perilous, and the use by financial institutions of similar risk models can lead to greater instability.	这种策略现在已经显示出其危险性，并且金融机构使用相似的风险模型会导致更大的不稳定。
Any new regulatory system should be based on a well functioning network of national and regional authorities (still missing in the European Union) and include truly international supervision of financial institutions with a global reach.	任何新的金融机构监管体系都应该建立在运作良好的国家以及区域机构（在欧盟仍然不存在这样的机构）网络之上，并且也应该包含用全球视野对金融机构进行的真正的国际监管。
Most agree that the International Monetary Fund should not be at the center of the regulatory system.	绝大多数人认为国际货币基金组织 不 应该处于这个监管体系的中心位置。
The Bank for International Settlements and the Basel Committee are better placed, but a fundamental reform is needed to broaden their membership and to avoid a major problem of the Basel Committee: its lack of representation of developing countries.	国际清算银行和巴塞尔委员会与国际货币基金组织相比处在更为有利的地位，但是要对它们进行根本性的改革以扩大它们的成员范围并避免巴塞尔委员会的主要问题：它缺乏对发展中国家的代表性。
Three central issues of IMF reform should also be taken on board.	国际货币基金组织改革的三个主要问题也应该提上日程。
The first is the need for a truly global reserve currency, perhaps based on the IMF Special Drawing Rights (SDRs).	第一个问题是确立真正的全球性储备货币的必要性，或许这种全球性储备货币会建立在国际货币基金组织的特别提款权(SDRs)上。
This would overcome both the inequities and the instability that is inherent in a global reserve system based on a national currency.	这样能克服建立在 国家 货币上的国际储备系统内在的不公平和不稳定。
Today’s system is plagued by cycles of confidence in the dollar and by periodic shocks due to American policies that are adopted independently of their global impact and thus imposed on the rest of the world.	对美元信心的周期性，以及由于独立于其全球影响而采用的美国政策，并进而将这样的美国政策施加给世界其他国家所造成的周期性冲击，都损害了现有的国际金融体系。
The second issue is the need to place the IMF, not the G-7 – or any other “G” – at the center of global macroeconomic policy coordination.	第二个问题是将国际货币基金组织，而不是G-7 — — 或任何其他的G什么国家，置于全球宏观经济政策协调的中心���置的必要性。
This is the only way to give developing countries a voice.	这是让发展中国家拥有发言权的唯一途径。
The multilateral surveillance on global imbalances that the Fund launched in 2006 was an interesting step in this direction, but it has lacked commitment by the parties, as well as teeth.	国际货币基金组织在2006年启动的对全球失衡的多边监管，是朝向这个方向发展的一个引人兴味的措施，但是，这一措施缺乏成员国的承诺，也没有执行机构。
The third issue is developing countries’ major demand. The IMF should lend during balance-of-payments crises rapidly and without overburdening conditions, particularly when the source of the crisis is a rapid reversal of capital flows or a sharp deterioration in the terms of trade.	第三个问题是发展中国家的主要需求。 国际货币基金组织应该在收支差额危机中迅速贷款，并且不对借款国家施加过重的负担条件，特别是当引起危机的原因是资本流向的快速逆转或者贸易收支的急剧恶化的时候。
This would make the IMF more like a central bank, providing liquidity in an agile way, just as advanced countries’ central banks have been providing funds on a massive scale recently.	这会使国际货币基金组织看起来更像是一个以灵活方式提供流动性的中央银行，这种方式就像发达国家的中央银行最近提供大规模资金所使用的那样。
In the case of the IMF, the financing for such liquidity could be counter-cyclical issues of SDRs.	就国际货币基金组织来说，提供这样的流动性的资金来源可以是特别提款权的抗周期发行。
In all these areas, the IMF should make more active use of regional institutions.	在所有这些领域，国际货币基金组织都应该更加积极地利用区域机构。
For a decade, I have proposed that the IMF of the future should be seen as the apex of a network of regional reserve funds – that is, a system closer in design to the European Central Bank or the United States Federal Reserve system.	十年来，我都在提议，未来的国际货币基金组织应该被看作是一个区域储备基金网络的顶点 — — 也就是说，一个在设计上和欧洲中央银行或者美国联邦储备系统相近的体系。
A similar institutional design could be adopted for prudential policies.	为了实现审慎监管政策的目的，可以采用类似的制度设计。
A denser network of institutions seems better adapted to a heterogeneous international community, and it is likely to provide better services and give a stronger voice to smaller countries.	一个更密集的机构网络似乎更适合多样化的国际社会，而且，这个机构网络也可能提供更好的服务和使小国发出更强有力的声音。
Finally, one major deficiency of the current international financial architecture is the lack of an institutional framework – i.e., a court similar to those created to manage bankruptcies in national economies – to manage debt overhangs at the international level.	最后，当今的国际金融体系的一个重大不足是缺乏一个制度框架 — — 例如，和国家建立的用于管理国民经济中的破产案件法庭类似的法庭 — — 在国际范围内管理债务积压。
The current system relies on ad hoc mechanisms, which generally operate too late, after high indebtedness has already imposed devastating effects.	当前的国际金融体系依靠的是临时机制，这些临时机制通常在高额债务已经造成破坏性后果之后，才运转起来，这时通常已经为时已晚。
The only regular institutional mechanism is the Paris Club, which deals exclusively with official financing.	现在唯一经常性的制度机制是巴黎俱乐部，但是，它只处理政府的融资问题。
Bretton Woods II should resolve this problem by creating an international debt court.	布雷顿森里体系II应该通过建立一个国际债务法庭，来解决这个问题。
The current financial crisis has made the need for reform of the international financial architecture patently clear.	当前的金融危机已经使改革国际金融体系的必要性突显出来了。
But any summons to a “Bretton Woods II” conference must be concrete in its content.	但是，任何召开“布雷顿森里体系II”会议的号召，在内容上都应该具体。
A global system for prudential regulation and supervision; a revamped IMF managing a global reserve currency, coordinating global macroeconomic policy, and providing agile credit lines; and an international debt court – all of these must be on the agenda.	审慎监管和指导的全球体系；完善后的国际货币基金组织管理一种全球储备货币，协调全球宏观经济政策，并提供灵活的信贷额度；以及一个国际债务法庭 — — 所有这些都必须提上“布雷顿森里体系II”会议的议程。
	
What’s Left of Confucianism?	儒家复兴
BEIJING – The Chinese government’s very public display of compassion and transparency in response to the devastating earthquake in Sichuan province appears to have strengthened its authority and its bonds with ordinary Chinese people.	北京 - - 四川强烈地震后，中国政府表现出同情和透明。 这好像加强了其权威及与普通民众的情义。
The government and army worked hand in hand with legions of volunteers and private networks to rescue quake victims.	政府与军队携手，与大批志愿者和私人网络一道援救地震受害者。
Even die-hard cynics were won over by Prime Minister Wen Jiabao’s emotional comforting of the survivors.	总理温家宝动情安慰灾民的场景甚至感化了顽固的玩世不恭者。
But heroic rescue efforts will not be able to help the government forever, so it is worth asking what can provide long-term political legitimacy.	但是壮烈的赈灾之举无法一劳永逸地帮助政府，所以，人们就有必要探寻什么东西可以提供长期的政治合法性。
After all, communism has lost its capacity to inspire the Chinese.	毕竟，共产主义已经没有能力鼓舞中国人民了。
So what should replace it?	那么，用什么来代替它呢？
Most Westerners think the answer is liberal democracy, as did many Chinese liberals in the twentieth century.	大多数西方人认为自由民主制度是解决之道，二十世纪的许多中国自由派人士也是如此。 但是还有一个途径。
But there is another answer, which takes the form of the old and venerable tradition of Confucianism, which is being revived by government officials, critical intellectuals, and ordinary citizens.	这一途径采用古老而又受人仰重的儒家传统形式。 政府官员、具有独到见解的知识分子以及普通公民正在复兴这一传统。
The opening ceremony of the Olympic games will highlight this revival: it will feature not quotes from Marx, but sayings from the Analects of Confucius.	北京奥运会的开幕式将会突出这一复兴。 开幕式不会引用马克思的语录，而是引用论语。
Such sayings as “The world’s peoples are all brothers” and “Isn’t one of life’s greatest pleasures to have friends visiting from afar?” will be beamed to billions worldwide, expressing the best that Chinese culture has to offer.	诸如“四海之内皆兄弟 ” 、 “有朋自远方来，不亦乐乎”等等将传播给全球几十亿观众，展示中华文化精华。
Here, however, we run into trouble.	但是这样我们又陷入困局。
Ever since the Han dynasty (more than 2,000 years ago), Chinese governments have manipulated the most prominent political interpretations of Confucianism for their own purposes.	从汉朝(两千多年以前)以来，历代中国政府为自身目的而操纵对儒家思想最为重要的政治解释。
Confucianism has been combined with Legalism, China’s other main political tradition, to justify such practices as blind obedience to the ruler, subordination of women, and the use of harsh punishments.	儒家与中国另一个主要政治传统法家合二为一，用来为一些做法提供依据，例如对统治者的盲从、压制妇女以及使用重刑。
The “official” Confucianism being revived today may be less dangerous – it emphasizes social harmony, meaning the peaceful resolution of conflicts – but it remains a conservative morality.	如今正在恢复的官方儒家可能并不如此危险，它强调社会和谐，也就是和平解决冲突。 但是它依旧是传统道德。
But there is another interpretation of Confucianism – let’s call it “left Confucianism” – that stresses intellectuals’ obligation to criticize bad policies, obliges governments to provide for the people’s material well-being and support those without key family relations, and calls for governments to adopt a more international-minded outlook and to rely on moral power rather than military might to pursue political aims.	但是人们对儒家还有另一种解说，姑且称之为“左派儒家 ” 。 它强调知识分子批评错误政策的责任，要求政府为百姓提供物质利益并且扶助无权无势之人，吁请政府更加具有国际视野并且更加依赖道德力量而非军力来实现政治目标。
It leaves open basic metaphysical commitments and takes a plural and tolerant view of religious life.	它开启基本的形而上学承诺并且对宗教生活采纳更为多元和宽容的观点。
It emphasizes equality of opportunity in education as well as meritocracy in government, with leadership positions being distributed to the community’s most virtuous and qualified members.	它强调教育机会平等以及政府为才是举，各级领导应当由最为德才兼备的人士担当。
Such values owe their origin to the “original Confucianism” of Confucius, Mencius, and Xunzi, which existed before Confucianism became established as state orthodoxy.	此类价值观来源于独尊儒术之前的“原本儒家 ” 、 孟子和荀子。
In imperial times, the critical tradition was carried forward by such scholars as Huang Zongxi.	在帝王时代，黄宗羲等学者秉承批评传统。
Today, new Confucian leftists such as Gan Yang are calling for the creation of a “Confucian socialist republic.”	如今，新儒家左派人士甘阳等人呼吁建立“儒家社会主义共和国 ” 。
Confucian scholars such as Jiang Qing openly acknowledge that their interpretation of Confucianism most closely parallels socialist ideals: not the “actually existing socialism” in today’s China, but the socialist ideals defended by Karl Marx and others.	儒家学者蒋庆等人公开承认其对儒家的解说最为贴近社会主义理想，亦即并非中国“现实存在的社会主义 ” ， 而是马克思等人所维护的社会主义理想。
This Confucian tradition aims to influence contemporary politics, but it also remains separate from state power and orthodoxy, always ready to point to the gap between ideals and reality.	这一儒家传统志在影响当今政治，但是又分立于国家权力和正统，时刻准备指出理想与现实之间的差距。
Indeed, left Confucianism’s departure from the status quo is precisely the point: it is meant to provide a moral standard for social critics and to inspire visions of a more desirable political future.	实际上，左派儒家从现状脱离切中要害。 它意在为社会批评人士提供道德标准并且激发一个更为可取的政治愿景。
Unlike communism, it offers a future that derives its legitimacy from tradition and building upon what the past has to offer – including the socialist tradition – rather than destroying it.	与共产主义不同，它设想一种未来，也就是其合法性取自于传统并且建立在历史之上、包括社会主义传统，而不是加以摧毁。
Thus, left Confucians favor institutional reform, arguing that the long-term stability and legitimacy of political institutions requires that they be founded on Chinese traditions.	因此，左派儒家人士倾向于机制改革。 他们主张社会长治久安以及政治机构的合法性要求建立于中国传统之上。
Jiang Qing advocates a tri-cameral legislature – a democratically elected People’s House representing the common people’s interests, a House of Exemplary Persons to secure the good of all those affected by government policies, including foreigners and minority groups, and a House of Cultural Continuity that would maintain China’s various religions and traditions.	蒋庆主张建立三远制，也就是民主选举产生的庶民院代表普通民众利益，道儒院确保受到政府政策影响的所有人的福祉，包括外国人和少数民族，还有国体院维护中国不同宗教和传统。
Such concrete proposals for political reform inspired by Confucian values can rarely be published in mainland China.	如此具体的、由儒家价值观引发而出的政治改革提议难以在中国大陆公开发表。
In fact, there are fewer constraints imposed on public discussion of liberal-democratic institutions precisely because few Chinese are inspired by Western-style liberal democracy.	实际上，正是由于鲜有中国人受到西方自由民主制度鼓舞，所以对于自由民主机制的公开讨论才限制较少。
Today, the most viable alternative to China’s political status quo is left Confucianism.	如今，中国政治现状最为可行的替换者就是左派儒家学说。
	
What’s Stopping Women?	什么在阻碍女性？
PRINCETON – When I wrote the cover article of the July/August issue of The Atlantic, entitled “Why Women Still Can’t Have It All,” I expected a hostile reaction from many American career women of my generation and older, and positive reactions from women aged roughly 25-35.	普林斯顿—我在撰写《大西洋 》 （ The Atlantic）7/8月号的封面文章《为什么女性仍然得不到这些 》 （ Why Women Still Can’t Have It All）时就预料到许多和我一样大或者比我更年长的美国职业女性会对此心怀不满，而25—35年龄段的女性会对此反应积极。
I expected that many men of that younger generation would also have strong reactions, given how many of them are trying to figure out how to be with their children, support their wives’ careers, and pursue their own plans.	我还预料年青一代的许多男性也会有激烈的反应，因为他们当中有不少在家带孩子、支持老婆的事业，同时追求自己的计划。
I also expected to hear from business representatives about whether my proposed solutions – greater workplace flexibility, ending the culture of face-time and “time machismo,” and allowing parents who have been out of the workforce or working part-time to compete equally for top jobs once they re-enter – were feasible or utopian.	我还预料商界代表会对我所提出的解决办法评论一番，说它们可行或纯属乌托邦什么的。 我的方案包括更大的工作地点灵活性、终结坐班文化和“时间大男子主义 ” （ time machismo ） 、 允许不再工作或只从事兼职的父母在重回工作岗位后获得平等的竞争高管职位的机会，如此等等。
What I did not expect was the speed and scale of the reaction – almost a million readers within a week and far too many written responses and TV, radio, and blog debates for me to follow – and its global scope.	我不曾预料到的是反应如此之速、如此之大 — — 短短一周之内便有近一百万读者和数不胜数的文章、电视、广播和博客与我争论这一话题，而且范围涉及全世界。
I have conducted interviews with journalists in Britain, Germany, Norway, India, Australia, Japan, the Netherlands, and Brazil; and articles about the piece have been published in France, Ireland, Italy, Bolivia, Jamaica, Vietnam, Israel, Lebanon, Canada, and many other countries.	我接受了英国、德国、挪威、印度、澳大利亚、日本、荷兰和巴西记者的采访；与该文相关的文章在法国、爱尔兰、意大利、玻利维亚、牙买加、越南、以色列、黎巴嫩、加拿大和其他许多国家大量涌现。
Reactions differ across countries, of course.	当然，不同国家的反应各不相同。
Indeed, in many ways, the article is a litmus test of where individual countries are in their own evolution toward full equality for men and women.	事实上，从许多方面看，这篇文章可以称为一国在通往男女完全平等之路上处于何处的试金石。
India and Britain, for example, have had strong women prime ministers in Indira Gandhi and Margaret Thatcher, but now must grapple with the “woman-as-man” archetype of female success.	比如，印度和英国已经有过强势的女性首相 — — 英迪拉·甘地和玛格丽特·撒切尔，但如今必须与成功女性的“巾帼不让须眉”原型作斗争。
The Scandinavian countries know that women around the world look to them as pioneers of social and economic policies that enable women to be mothers and successful career professionals, and that encourage and expect men to play an equal parenting role.	斯堪的纳维亚国家知道，全世界女性把它们视为社会和经济政策的先锋 — — 能让女性既当母亲，又成为成功职业妇女，并鼓励和期望男性承担同样的抚养责任。
But they are not producing as many women managers in the private sector as the United States is, much less at the top ranks.	但这些国家私人部门的女性管理者人数不及美国，获得顶尖职位的女性更是少之又少。
The Germans are deeply conflicted.	德国人在这个问题上颇为纠结。
One major German magazine decided to frame my contribution to the debate as “career woman admits that it’s better to be home.”	一家德国主要刊物决定把我的文章纳入“职业女性承认居家才是更好的归宿”这一议题。
Another (more accurately) highlighted my emphasis on the need for deep social and economic change to allow women to have equal choices.	另一家大刊（比前一家更靠谱一些）大肆渲染了我所强调的需要通过深刻社会和经济变革来促使女性获得平等选择机会的观点。
The French remain studiously aloof, even a little disdainful, as befits a nation that rejects “feminism” as an anti-feminine American creation and manages to produce a leader who is simultaneously as accomplished and as elegant as Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.	法国人一如既往地刻意保持着旁观姿态，甚至略���嗤之以鼻之意，作为一个将“女权主义”视为反女性的美国产物加以拒绝、并出产了成就斐然又优雅绰约的IMF总裁克里斯汀·拉加德这样的领袖人物的国家，持有这样的态度倒也合适。
Of course, the example of her predecessor, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, and other stories about French male behavior that would count as clear sexual harassment in the stodgy US, suggest that perhaps a bit more feminisme a la Française is in order.	当然，拉加德的前任多米尼克·斯特劳斯-卡恩以及许多其他法国男性的行径在庸俗的美国人眼里属于如假包换的性骚扰，这表明大概有一种“法国式女权主义 ” （ feminisme a la Française）在作祟。
Beyond Europe, Japanese women lament how far they must still go in a relentlessly male and sexist culture.	在欧洲之外，日本女性哀叹她们在无情的男权文化和性别歧视中仍然任重道远。
The Chinese now have a generation of educated, empowered young women who are not sure whether they want to marry at all, owing to the constraints that a husband (and a mother-in-law) would place on their freedom.	在中国，新一代女性受过教育，也拥有权利，她们犹豫着要不要结婚，因为害怕丈夫（和婆婆）限制自己的自由。
Brazilian women point with pride to their president, Dilma Rousseff, but also underscore how much discrimination remains.	巴西女性自豪地指出她们有一个女总统迪尔马·罗塞夫，但也强调仍然存在严重的歧视。
In Australia, with its robust work-life debate, women point to the success of Julia Gillard, the first woman prime minister, but note that she has no children (nor does German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the first woman to lead her country).	在澳大利亚，工作-生活的争论一直不温不火，女性将第一位女总理茱莉亚·吉拉德视为榜样，但也指出她没有孩子（德国第一位女领导人、总理默克尔也是如此 ） 。
The global nature of this debate demonstrates at least three important lessons.	这场全球争论至少说明了三个问题。
First, if “soft power” means exercising influence because “others want what you want,” as Joseph Nye puts it, then women the world over want what American feminists began fighting for three generations ago.	首先，如果“软实力”意味着因“他人欲你之所欲 ” （ 约瑟夫·奈（Joseph Nye）语）而施加影响，那么全世界女性之所欲乃美国女权主义者已为之奋斗了三代人的东西。
Second, Americans, not surprisingly, have much to learn from other countries’ debates, laws, and cultural norms.	其次，毫不奇怪，美国人可以从其他国家的争论、法律和文化范式中学到很多东西。
After all, women have ascended the political ladder faster in many other countries than they have in the US.	毕竟，许多国家女性在政界的爬升速度要远快于美国。
Indeed, the US has never had a woman president, Senate majority leader, Secretary of the Treasury, or Secretary of Defense.	事实上，美国从来没有出过女总统、女参议院多数派领袖、女财政部长和女国防部长。
Finally, these are not “women’s issues,” but social and economic issues.	最后，这些都不是“女性的问题 ” ， 而是社会和经济问题。
Societies that discover how to use the education and talent of half their populations, while allowing women and their partners to invest in their families, will have a competitive edge in the global knowledge/innovation economy.	如果一个社会能够发现如何用好半边天所受的教育和天赋，同时又让女性及其伙伴为家庭进行投资，那么这个社会就能在全球知识/创新经济中赢得竞争优势。
Of course, hundreds of millions of women around the world can only wish that they had the problems about which I wrote.	当然，全世界还有千百万女性巴不得可以面临我所描述的问题。
Last week brought news of yet another murder of a women’s rights activist in Pakistan; evidence that the Egyptian military may be deliberately using sexual assault to deter women from demonstrating in Cairo’s Tahrir Square; a horrific report from the New York-based Women’s Media Center about Syrian government forces’ use of sexual violence and gang rape; and a video of a Taliban commander brutally executing a woman for adultery as his fellow soldiers and villagers cheered.	上周，巴基斯坦又曝出一桩谋杀女性权利活跃分子的案子；有证据表明埃及军方可能故意采用性侵犯阻止女性在开罗解放广场的示威；纽约女性媒体中心曝光了叙利亚政府军的性侵和轮奸行径；一份视频显示塔利班某指挥官残忍地以通奸罪处决一名女性，而他的士兵和村民一边围观一边欢呼。
Those are just the most extreme cases of physical violence that many women face.	这些只是许多妇女所面对的身体暴力的极端例子。
Worldwide, more than a billion women confront grinding and overt gender discrimination in education, nutrition, health care, and salaries.	从全球看，超过10亿女性在教育、营养、卫生和薪酬方面面临着难以忍受的公然性别歧视。
Women’s rights are a global issue of the highest importance, and it is necessary to focus on the worst violations.	女性权利是最重要的全球性问题，关注最严重暴力行为刻不容缓。
Still, consider a recent matter-of-fact report from a sober and respected US magazine.	仍以某冷静客观、广受尊敬的美国杂志的最新事实报告为例。
In an article on “Women in Washington,” the National Journal observed that women in the US capital have come a long way, but “still face career barriers, and often the biggest one is having a family.”	在一篇题为《华盛顿的女性 》 （ Women in Washington）的文章中 ， 《 国家杂志 》 （ National Journal）观察道，在美国首都，女性地位已经得到了很大提高，但“仍然面临职业壁垒，其中最大的壁垒是成家 。 ”
If “having a family” is still a career barrier for women, but not for men, that, too, is a matter of women’s rights (and thus of human rights).	如果“成家”依然是女性的职业壁垒，而对男性并非如此，那么这便是一个女性权利问题（从而也是人权问题 ） 。
In the global debate about work, family, and the promise of gender equality, no society is exempt.	在全球工作、家庭和性别平等承诺的大论战中，没有哪个社会可以例外。
	
What’s the Beef in South Korea?	What’s the Beef in South Korea?
NEW YORK – At the outset of the ongoing violent protests in South Korea over imported beef from the United States, the entire cabinet of South Korean President Lee Myung-bak offered to resign. Last week, President Lee fired three of them.	纽约－在韩国持续进行的反对从美国进口的牛肉的暴力抗议开始的时候，韩国总统李明博的内阁集体要求辞职。 上个星期，李明博总统解雇了其中的三人。
But beef, it turns out, represents just the tip of the iceberg of grievances against President Lee.	但是，事实是，牛肉仅仅代表了反对李明博总统愤怒情绪的冰山一角。
Only four months in office, his approval rating is down to single digits.	只任职了四个月，他的支持率已经降到了个位数。
Lee won the December 2007 election with 48.7% of the vote, having run on the “747” platform, promising 7% annual GDP growth, per capita income of $40,000, and to make Korea the world’s seventh largest economy (up from 13th currently).	李明博在2007年12月以48.7%的得票数赢得了总统选举，并详细阐述了其“747”纲领，承诺使韩国年均GDP增长率达到7 % ， 国民人均收入达到4万美元，以及使韩国成为世界第七大经济体（现在是第十三大 ） 。
During his inauguration speech, he vowed to revive the economy, strengthen relations with the US, and deal with North Korea.	在他的就职演说中，李明博发誓要振兴经济，加强和美国的关系并对付北朝鲜。
So what went wrong?	那么，什么出了问题呢？
The economy is slowing – the Bank of Korea cut its growth forecast for this year to 4.7%, while the OECD expects only 4.3% growth – inflation is rising, and some are concerned that Lee’s policies are too geared toward foreign investors and big business.	经济在放缓 — — 韩国银行将韩国经济增长预期降低至4.7 % ， 与此同时，经济发展与合作组织（OECD）预期韩国经济增长率只有4.3 % — —通货膨胀在加剧，而且一些人担心李明博的政策过于迎合外国投资者和大企业。
Lee also must confront factors beyond his control, such as soaring oil prices and the global credit crunch.	李明博也必须面对他不能控制的因素，例如飙升的油价和全球信贷危机。
Beyond the economy, Lee has been faced with charges of appointing officials with questionable ethics and of heavy-handed leadership (his nickname is “Bulldozer”), which is reflected in efforts to push through a controversial cross-country canal system and an unpopular proposal to privatize the healthcare system.	除经济之外，李明博已经面临着任命道德可疑的官员以及领导方式过于严厉（他的绰号是“推土机 ” ） 的指责，这种严厉的领导方式反映在努力促成一个有争议的贯通全国的运河系统以及一个不受欢迎的私有化医疗系统的提议上。
Furthermore, Lee’s hard-line approach to North Korea – very different from that of his predecessors – has resulted in a popular backlash.	此外，李明博对北朝鲜的强硬态度 — — 和他的前任态度非常不同 — — 已经导致了支持率的下降。
To be sure, as North Korea seemingly snubbed the international community in recent years, there was considerable popular discontent with the previous two administrations’ “sunshine” policy, which emphasized peaceful cooperation prior to eventual Korean unification.	固然，因为最近几年北朝鲜公然漠视国际社会的态度，韩国民众对前两届政府的“阳光”政策 — — 强调在朝鲜最终统一之前的和平合作 — — 有许多的不满。
But now, with the North’s destruction of key elements of its nuclear program, international negotiations appear to be bearing fruit, and Lee’s tougher stance has gained less approval than might have been anticipated when he came to office.	但是现在，随着北朝鲜销毁了其核项目的主要设施，国际谈判似乎起作用了，对李明博对北朝鲜采取强硬态度的支持率比他在就职的时候预期得要低。
The combined effect of these developments has been to erode Lee’s reputation precipitously.	这些事态发展的结果结合起来，极大地损害了李明博的声誉。
Now, on top of everything, comes the beef controversy.	现在，迫在眉睫的是关于牛肉的争议。
In April, on his first foreign trip following his inauguration, Lee traveled to the US.	在四月份，作为就职典礼后的首次外国访问，李明博出访了美国。
On the eve of the visit, his government agreed to lift the five-year-old ban on US beef imports as part of efforts to improve bilateral ties following years of up-and-down relations during former President Roh Moo-hyun’s administration.	在李明博出访前夕，韩国政府同意解除对美国牛肉长达五年的进口禁令，以此作为在前任总统卢武铉政府期间两国关系起起落落之后增进双边关系努力的一部分。
While most in the West applauded Lee’s visit, the reaction in Korea was significantly more negative.	虽然西方的大多数人对李明博的访问表示欢迎，但是在韩国，人们对此次出访的反应非常负面。
Many in Korea viewed the beef decision as having been hastily taken, and without appropriate consultation of all relevant parties.	许多韩国人认为有关牛肉的决定是很草率的，并且没有在所有相关各方之间进行适当的协商。
In addition, significant segments of the population saw the agreement as Lee selling out or kowtowing to the Americans.	而且，相当多的韩国民众将这个协议看作是李明博出卖韩国或者讨好美国的行为。
The public reaction began with a demonstration in Seoul on May 2 in which hundreds of teenagers held a candlelight vigil.	韩国公众对此的反应以五月二日在首尔的游行示威开始，在此次游行示威中，许多青少年手持蜡烛守夜。
Soon, tens of thousands of Koreans joined the protests.	很快，上万的韩国人加入了抗议。
Lee seems to have misjudged the strength of his election victory and the currents of opinion in several important ways.	李明博似乎在几个重要的方面错误地判断了选举获胜的力量以及观点的走向。
Given the nationalist sentiments motivating the beef protesters, the strength of opposition forces, and widespread hostility to opening and privatizing the South Korean economy further, Lee, whose authoritarian style of management reminds many of the era of military rule, will now need to move forward carefully.	鉴于民族情绪激起了对牛肉的抗议，反对派的力量，以及对进一步开放和私有化韩国经济的普遍的不满，使用独裁式的领导方法使很多人想起军事统治时期的李明博，现在需要谨慎地前进。
Lee must reach out to the opposition, both within his party and outside it, to build agreement or negotiate compromise on the contentious issues that his administration faces.	李明博必须向党内以及党外的反对派伸出双手，以对其政府面临的有争议的问题达成协议或者谈判折衷的方案。
He must reach out to the people of Korea and demonstrate that he is willing to listen to their concerns and act accordingly.	他必须向韩国人民伸出双手，并显示他愿意倾听他们关心的问题并采取相应的行动。
Finally, he must act on his campaign promises to build a more prosperous and confident Korea.	最后，他 必须按照他的竞选承诺行动，来建立一个更加繁荣和自信的韩国。
The upside of all this political turmoil is that it demonstrates the vigor of Korean democracy.	这场政治混乱最重要的方面是，它显示了韩国民主的活力。
Lee’s task now is to discover how best to take advantage of this new political activism.	现在，李明博的任务是发现怎样能最好地利用这一新的政治行动主义。
He has faced political adversity before, and he will again.	他从前已经面对过政治逆境，他将来还会碰到。

What’s Wrong with Ethnic Profiling?	“种族歧视”的弊端
BRUSSELS – Several years ago, as terrorism, immigration, and unrest in suburban Paris were at the top of the news in France, a French police officer confided to a researcher: “If you consider different levels of trafficking, it is obviously done by blacks and Arabs.	布鲁塞尔—几年前，当有关恐怖主义、移民及巴黎郊区骚乱的消息占据法国新闻媒体的头条时，一名法国警官私下里向一名学者透露 ： “ 一旦你想到各种非法交易时，很显然，这些事都是黑人和阿拉伯人干的。
If you are on the road and see a black man or a man with Arabic features, you say to yourself, ‘He doesn’t look French,’ and then you might stop him to see if he has papers.”	如果你在路上看见一个黑人或者一个长相有阿拉伯人特征的人，你会告诉自己 ， ‘ 他看上去不是法国人。 ’然后你也许会拦住他，让他出示证件 。 ”
This police officer was describing a textbook example of “ethnic profiling”: law enforcement officials use of stereotypes, rather than specific information about behavior, in deciding to stop, search, or detain people.	这名警官所描述的正是一种教科书式的“以种族相貌取人”的例子。 执法人员在决定是否叫停、搜查或拘留当事人时，依据的信息不是关于当事人行为的，而是套用了一种思维定势。
Ethnic profiling is illegal in Europe. It is ineffective in apprehending criminals.	这种“以种族相貌取人”的方式在欧洲是不合法的。
It is counter-productive in the campaign against terrorism.	捉拿罪犯时并不奏效，同样的，在对抗恐怖主义活动也没有效果。
But police officers across Europe continue to use it.	但是，全欧洲的警官却沿用采用这种方式。
The inefficiency of ethnic profiling was highlighted in early May, when the British government released figures showing that, of the more than 117,000 police stops made between 2007 and 2008, only 72 led to an arrest for terrorism-related offences.	5月初，这种“以种族相貌取人”的方式引起重视，这源于当时英国政府发布的一组数据，数据显示，在2007至2008年间，警察展开的对当事人117，000次的叫停问询中，只有72次与恐怖犯罪有关，最后对当事人逮捕。
Other major European countries do not collect data on police stops broken down according to the targets’ ethnic or religious background.	关于警察根据调查对象的种族或者宗教背景对当事人进行问询的事例，其他一些主要欧洲国家还没有搜集相关数据。
But private research and anecdotal reports provide a frighteningly similar picture.	但私家调查机构和一些非正式渠道提供的数据却是令人惊人般的相似。
A massive data-mining exercise in Germany from 2001 to 2003 trawled through personal information on 8.3 million people and failed to find a single terrorist.	2001年至2003年间，德国曾在对830万人的个人信息开展了一次大规模的检索式调查，结果是没有发现一名恐怖分子。
Stops and searches conducted under counter-terrorism powers in Europe have produced few terrorism charges and no convictions.	在欧洲大陆，政府以反恐怖名义展开的问询和调查，最后的结果是只有个别的指控，但没有一宗被定罪。
Separate studies in Britain, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States have concluded that ethnic profiling wastes time and resources.	在英国、荷兰、瑞典和美国开展的研究也表明 ， “ 以种族相貌取人”的判断方式只能是浪费时间和资源。
As a new report by the Open Society Justice Initiative shows, by targeting ethnic minorities, police alienate some of the very people on whom they depend for cooperation and intelligence.	由“开放社会正义行动”机构（Open Society Justice Initiative）新发布的一个报告显示，因为只将目标锁定在少数派种族上，警局疏远了那些他们本可以依赖于合作、提供情报的一些人。
And by pre-selecting fixed categories of people for heightened scrutiny, the authorities overlook those who do not fit the profile.	因为预先选择出一些固定群体进行详细审查，当局反而忽略了那些并不符合种族特征的人。
A young Spanish man who is a member of an ethnic minority group put it this way: “I worry when I go on the street that the police will stop me and ask me for my papers because of the color of my skin, by my tone of skin, by my way of walking.”	作为少数民族的一员，一名西班牙年轻人这样说 ： “ 我在街上走路时，会担心警察因为我的肤色、我的口音和我走路的姿势而叫住我，查问我的证件 。 ”
Given its failings, why is ethnic profiling so widespread?	既然已经有这么多不成功的案例，可为什么这种以种族相貌取人的方式仍如此普遍？
The answer is simple.	答案很简单。
When the police use ethnic profiling, they project an image of being tough on crime and terrorism.	当警察采用这种方式的时候，他们展现给公众的是一种对犯罪和恐怖主义表现强硬的姿态。
This appeases public opinion, which demands robust anti-terrorism action.	对于要求严打恐怖主义的公众来说，警察的做法就是一种安抚。
Following the September 2001 attacks in New York, and again after the bombings in Madrid in 2004 and London in 2005, law-enforcement authorities across Europe launched mass-arrest operations, undertook widespread surveillance of mosques, carried out stops and searches of people who appeared to be Muslim, and used other intrusive measures that disrupted the lives of – and in many cases humiliated – law-abiding European citizens.	继2001年纽约911袭击事件、2004年马德里爆炸案和2005年伦敦爆炸案后，欧洲的执法当局就发动了大规模的逮捕行动，对清真寺进行监视、对于那些看上去像穆斯林教徒的人进行询问和搜查；并采取其它一些侵犯性的措施，甚至一些让人难堪的方式、扰乱了欧洲遵纪守法的普通公民的生活。
As public anxiety has abated, and senior officials have felt less pressure to show that they are doing something, the most flagrant abuses have declined.	随着公众对恐怖主义的忧虑缓解下来后，高级官员们的压力就小了些，他们不再急于向公众表现。
But such practices are still being applied to a lesser degree, and they can be pulled out of the arsenal whenever political or social conditions dictate.	于是，那些最明目张胆的、滥用职权的行为减少了，但是这种方式时有发生，只是程度有所减轻。 一旦社会政治环境变得紧张时，它们就会卷土重��。
Fortunately, some of Europe’s leaders recognize the problem.	幸运的是，一些欧洲的领导人已经认识到了这个问题。
In late April, the European Parliament issued a report highlighting the danger that unrestricted data mining that relies on racial, ethnic, or national origin would subject innocent people to arbitrary stops, travel restrictions, and bans on employment or banking.	4月末，欧洲议会发布了一篇报告，对于以种族、民族或者国籍为依据对个人资料进行毫无限制的调查行为发出警告，声明这种行为十分危险，不但无辜的人遭到审查、人们的旅行受到限制，而且他们就业和金融权利也遭到禁止。
The report called for legislation to protect against ethnic profiling.	报告呼吁各国应该开展立法，以保护人们免遭这种以种族相貌取人方式的侵害。
The solution is not to ignore the threat of terrorism, but to address the threat more intelligently.	如此这般倒不是忽略恐怖主义的威胁，而是采取更明智的方法来处理恐怖问题。
Over the past two years, a project that our organization undertook with police forces and civil-society groups in Hungary and Spain found that, when stops were systematically monitored and data publicly reported, the proportion of stops that produced an arrest or other law-enforcement outcome actually increased. Police work became more efficient.	在过去2年间，我们机构与匈牙利和西班牙的警察及民权组织合作开展了一个项目，在调查中发现，当警察对当事人问询的行为被系统性地监督，信息公开化后，最终实施逮捕的概率增加，执法效果也变得显著，警察的工作更加富有效率。
This makes sense.	这才是正确的方法。
When officers are required to articulate grounds for suspicion, they are more likely to rely on behavioral factors rather than prejudice.	当我们要求警官说出他们为什么把当事人列为嫌疑人的理由时，他们就会更多考虑当事人行为的因素，而不是仅仅出自偏见。
In the future, the European Union and its member states should fund more collaboration between police and minority communities.	将来，欧盟和其成员国应该出钱资助警察与少数种族群体之间的合作。
The EU should combat radicalization by addressing exclusion, not by conflating conservative religious faith with terrorism.	欧盟应该反对激进和排外的行为，不应把宗教信仰和恐怖主义联系在一起。
And it should make clear that police may not use ethnic, racial, or religious stereotypes.	欧盟应该明确一点，就是警察不可以采用以民族、种族和宗教为依据来进行判断的思维定势。
By treating people as suspicious purely because of who they are, how they look, or where they pray, rather than what they do or have done, ethnic profiling threatens the very ethos of the EU, a union firmly rooted in values of liberty, democracy, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.	只是因为人们的长相、信仰，而不是依据他们的所作所为，就把其认作是嫌疑人，这种以种族特征做出判断的方式威胁到欧盟的核心价值观，欧盟根深蒂固的信仰本来在于自由、民主和对人权和基本自由的尊重。
	
What’s Wrong with Transformational Leadership?	变革型领导错在何处？
CAMBRIDGE – This year’s presidential campaign in the United States has been marked by calls from Barack Obama’s would-be Republican challengers for a radical transformation of American foreign policy.	美国剑桥—今年的美国大选有一个特点：奥巴马的潜在共和党挑战者无不要求对美国外交政策来个彻底变革。
Campaigns are always more extreme than the eventual reality, but countries should be wary of calls for transformational change.	竞选口号总是比最后的落实要极端得多，但世界各国应该仍会对美国外交政策变革感到担忧。
Things do not always work out as intended.	事情并不总能遂人愿望的。
Foreign policy played almost no role in the 2000 US presidential election.	在2000年美国总统大选中，外交政策几乎没有起到任何作用。
In 2001, George W. Bush started his first term with little interest in foreign policy, but adopted transformational objectives after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.	2001年，小布什开始了他的首个任期，一开始，他对外交政策并不感兴趣，但在2001年9·11恐怖袭击之后倒向了变革型外交。
Like Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, and Harry Truman before him, Bush turned to the rhetoric of democracy to rally his followers in a time of crisis.	与伍德罗·威尔逊、富兰克林·罗斯福和哈里·杜鲁门等前任一样，当危机来临时，布什高举民主大旗，振臂一呼，应者云集。
Bill Clinton had also talked about enlarging the role of human rights and democracy in US foreign policy, but most Americans in the 1990’s sought normality and a post-Cold War peace dividend rather than change.	比尔·克林顿也曾谈及要在美国外交政策中加大人权和民主的作用，但大多数美国人在20世纪90年代追求的是正常化和后冷战时期的和平红利，而不是变化。
By contrast, Bush’s 2002 National Security Strategy, which came to be called the Bush Doctrine, proclaimed that the US would “identify and eliminate terrorists wherever they are, together with the regimes that sustain them.”	相反，被称为布什主义的2002年国家安全战略高调宣布美国将“挖出并清除恐怖主义者，连同他们所依赖的制度一并消灭，无论他们藏身何处 。 ”
The solution to the terrorist problem was to spread democracy everywhere.	解决恐怖主义的办法是将民主输送到世界各地。
Bush invaded Iraq ostensibly to remove Saddam Hussein’s capacity to use weapons of mass destruction and, in the process, to change the regime.	布什出兵伊拉克的表面理由是消灭萨达姆·侯赛因的大规模杀伤性武器，顺便改变伊拉克的政权。
Bush cannot be blamed for the intelligence failures that attributed such weapons to Saddam, given that many other countries shared such estimates.	不能把萨达姆拥有大规模杀伤性武器的情报失误归咎于布什，因为很多其他国家也有此定论。
But inadequate understanding of the Iraqi and regional context, together with poor planning and management, undercut Bush’s transformational objectives.	但对伊拉克及其所在地区理解不够充分以及行动缺乏规划和管理使得布什的大大妨碍了布什的变革型目标。
Although some of Bush’s defenders try to credit him with the “Arab Spring” revolutions, the primary Arab participants reject such arguments.	尽管布什的支持者中有人将“阿拉伯之春”革命归功与他，但阿拉伯之春的主要参与者否认了这一点。
Bush was described by The Economist as “obsessed by the idea of being a transformational president; not just a status-quo operator like Bill Clinton.”	《经济学人》杂志称布什“太想成为变革型总统，而不是像比尔·克林顿那样稳守现状 。 ”
Then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice praised the virtues of “transformational diplomacy.”	时任国务卿康多莉扎·赖斯对“变革型外交”的优点不吝赞美之词。
But, while leadership theorists and editorial writers tend to think that transformational foreign-policy officials are better in either ethics or effectiveness, the evidence does not support this view.	然而，尽管领导学理论家和评论员均认为变革型外交政策官员不管在道德还是效率方面都有所提高，但事实并没有证明这一点。
Other leadership skills are more important than the usual distinction between transformational and “transactional” leaders.	就变革型领导人和“维持型”领导人的区别而言，其他领导技能更加重要。
Consider President George H.W. Bush, who did not do “the vision thing,” but whose sound management and execution underpinned one of the most successful US foreign-policy agendas of the past half-century.	比如，老布什总统从来不做“远在天边的事 ” ， 但其踏实的管理和执行打造了美国过去50年中最成功的外交日程。
Perhaps genetic engineers will one day be able to produce leaders equally endowed with both vision and management skills; comparing the two Bushes (who shared half their genes), it is clear that nature has not yet solved the problem.	或许有朝一日基因工程师能够打造出兼具愿景和管理技能的领导人，比较布什父子（他们身上一半的血液是一样的 ） ， 显然，天性并不是解决问题的全部。
This is not an argument against transformational leaders.	这么说并不是看低变革型领导人。
Mohandas Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, and Martin Luther King, Jr., played crucial roles in transforming people’s identity and aspirations.	圣雄甘地、纳尔逊·曼德拉和马丁·路德·金在改变人民心身方面均取得了巨大成就。
Nor is this an argument against transformational leaders in US foreign policy.	这么说也不是看低美国外交政策中的变革型领导人。
Franklin Roosevelt and Truman made crucial contributions.	富兰克林·罗斯福和杜鲁门都做出过重大贡献。
But, in judging leaders, we need to pay attention to acts of both omission and commission, to what happened and to what was avoided, to the dogs that barked and to those that did not.	但是，在评价领导人时，我们既要看到成就，也要看到阙漏；���要看发生了什么，也要看避免了发生什么；既要看听其言，也要观其行。
A big problem in foreign policy is the complexity of the context.	外交政策的一个大问题是环境的复杂性。
We live in a world of diverse cultures, and we know very little about social engineering and how to “build nations.”	我们生活在一个文化多元的世界中，我们对社会工程和如何“建设国家”所知甚少。
When we cannot be sure how to improve the world, prudence becomes an important virtue, and grandiose visions can pose grave dangers.	当我们不确定应该如何改善世界时，审慎就成了重要的美德，而宏伟蓝图可能给世界带来重大隐患。
In foreign policy, as in medicine, it is important to remember the Hippocratic Oath: first, do no harm.	外交政策应该像医学那样记住希波克拉底誓言：莫伤人。
For these reasons, the virtues of transactional leaders with good contextual intelligence are very important.	因此，拥有优秀相关情报的维持型型领导人的美德极其重要。
Someone like George H. W. Bush, unable to articulate a vision but able to steer successfully through crises, turns out to be a better leader than someone like his son, possessed of a powerful vision but with little contextual intelligence or management skill.	比如老布什尽管没有高瞻远瞩的能力，但却能游刃有余地在危机中应付裕如，和他的能高瞻远瞩但缺乏高质量相关情报和管理技巧的儿子相比，老布什更加优秀。
Former Secretary of State George Shultz, who served under Ronald Reagan, once compared his role to gardening –“the constant nurturing of a complex array of actors, interests, and goals.”	里根时代的国务卿乔治·舒尔茨曾把他的角色比作园丁 — — “不断地培育复杂的行动者、利益和目标的复杂综合体 ” 。
But Shultz’s Stanford colleague, Condoleezza Rice, wanted a more transformational diplomacy that did not accept the world as it was, but tried to change it.	但舒尔茨的斯坦福同学康多莉扎·赖斯想要的是变革型外交，她拒绝接受世界的现状，试图改造它。
As one observer put it, “Rice’s ambition is not just to be a gardener – she wants to be a landscape architect.”	正如一位观察者所言 ， “ 赖斯可不甘于当一个园丁，她想当园林设计师 。 ”
There is a role for both, depending on the context, but we should avoid the common mistake of automatically thinking that the transformational landscape architect is a better leader than the careful gardener.	两种类型世界都需要，取决于具体的情况，但我们需要避免的错误是想当然地认为变革型园林设计师就一定比谨慎的园丁更好。
We should keep this in mind as we assess the current US presidential debates, with their constant reference to American decline.	在考察当前美国总统竞选辩论时，我们应该时刻铭记这一点。 当前总统辩论三句话不离美国的衰落。
Decline is a misleading metaphor.	衰落是一个具有误导性的用语。
America is not in absolute decline, and, in relative terms, there is a reasonable probability that it will remain more powerful than any other country in the coming decades.	从绝对意义上说，美国并没有衰落；从相对意义上说，在未来十年中，没有哪个国家具有在实力上超越美国的实质可能。
We do not live in a “post-American world,” but we also do not live in the American era of the late twentieth century.	我们并没有进入“后美国世界 ” ， 但20世纪末的美国时代已经过去了。
The US will be faced with a rise in the power resources of many others – both states and non-state actors.	美国将面临众多实力源的崛起，有些是国家，有些是非国家行动者。
It will also confront a growing number of issues that require power with others as much as power over others in order to obtain the country’s preferred outcomes.	为了获得美国所希望的结果，在越来越多的问题上，美国需要和其他势力联手处理，而不是凌驾于其他势力之上。
America’s capacity to maintain alliances and create cooperative networks will be an important dimension of its hard and soft power.	美国维持联盟和创造合作网的能力将是其硬实力和软实力的重要组成部分。
The problem of America’s role in the twenty-first century is not one of (poorly specified) “decline,” but rather of developing the contextual intelligence to understand that even the largest country cannot achieve what it wants without others’ help.	美国在21世纪的角色定位的问题并不在于（被错误定义的 ） “ 衰落 ” ， 而在于改善相关情报，认识到就算是最大的国家也无法单枪匹马为所欲为。
Educating the public to understand this complex globalized information age, and what is required to operate successfully in it, will be the real transformational leadership task.	教育公众，使之理解这一复杂的全球信息时代以及在这样一个时代获得成功所需要的条件才是真正的变革型领导任务。
Thus far, we are not hearing much about it from the Republican candidates.	到目前为止，共和党领导人在这方面并没有多少见地。
	
What’s Wrong With Turkey?	土耳其的问题何在？
On December 16, Orhan Pamuk, one of Turkey’s most famous writers, will enter an Istanbul court to face a charge of “insulting the national identity” after he advocated open discussion of the Turkish genocide of 1.5 million Armenians in 1915 and 1916.	12月16日，土耳其著名作家奥罕·帕慕克将在伊斯坦布尔一家法庭接受审判，答辩针对他提起的“侮辱国家形象”的诉讼，事情的起因是他提出要对1915年和1916年土耳其屠杀150万亚美尼亚人一事举行公开的讨论。
Pamuk faces three years in prison.	帕慕克将因此面临长达三年的监禁。
Turkey’s effort to fine and imprison those who do not toe the official line convinces me that I was correct to oppose opening negotiations on the country’s European Union membership.	土耳其在对那些不服从政府路线的人士进行经济处罚和刑事监禁的做法使我确信：本人一贯反对谈判该国加入欧盟的问题是正确的。
In December 1999, the European Council granted Turkey the status of EU candidate-member, implying that Turkey would accede to the Union at some future, unspecified date.	欧盟理事会于1999年12月批准土耳其获得欧盟成员国候选国地位，这意味着土耳其将在未来某一不确定时间加入欧盟。
The Council subsequently asked the European Commission to decide by October 2004 whether Turkey had sufficiently fulfilled the political criteria – including democracy, the rule of law, and respect for the rights of ethnic minorities – for membership.	理事会随后要求欧盟委员会在2004年12月之前对土耳其是否充分达到了成员国应具备的政治标准这一问题做出评判¾评判的内容包括民主、法制、对少数族裔权利的尊重三个方面。
That decision was one of the last taken by Romano Prodi’s Commission, of which I was a member.	该评判是由罗马诺·普罗迪领导的欧盟委员会所做出的最后一项评判，当时我是其中一员。
Of its 30 members, 29 said that Turkey had fulfilled the criteria sufficiently to proceed. I was the lone dissenter.	在30名委员当中，29人表示土耳其已经充分达到了这一标准，可以继续推进入盟程序，而我却是唯一的反对者。
The Commission’s own report on Turkey, prepared by Günter Verheugen, who was then in charge of EU enlargement, shaped my decision.	我反对的基础是当时欧盟执委会负责扩大事务的执委甘特·沃河根起草的一份委员会报告。
This report mentioned that in 2003 some 21,870 Turks submitted asylum claims in the EU, of which 2,127 were accepted.	报告中指出2003年约21870名土耳其人向欧盟提交了庇护申请，其中的2127人被给予相应援助。
In other words, the EU’s own governments acknowledged in 2003 that the Turkish government had persecuted more than 2,000 of its own citizens.	换句话说，欧盟成员国政府当时承认，2003年土耳其政府曾迫害2000多名本国公民。
Meanwhile, the Commission published a progress report on Turkey that granted that reforms were continuing, albeit at a slower pace, under Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s mildly Islamic-minded government.	同时，委员会公布了一份关于土耳其的国家发展报告，承认在总理雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安带领的伊斯兰温和派政府的领导下，土耳其的各项改革正在进行中，虽然步伐比较缓慢。
Yet the report also presented serious misgivings: human rights violations, including torture, continued; the military’s influence remained too high; freedom of speech was not universally observed; non-Muslim religious and cultural minorities faced discrimination; and violence against women was not opposed strongly enough.	但是，报告也提出了某些严重疑虑：包括肉体折磨在内的侵犯人权的行为依然在继续、军事影响过于强大、缺乏广泛的言论自由、少数非穆斯林宗教和文化群体面临歧视、对妇女实施的暴力没有得到有效遏制等等。
Not much has changed since accession talks began this October.	今年10月入盟对话开始以来，这些状况没有明显的好转。
Beyond the current persecution of Pamuk, unacceptable behavior abounds.	除了对帕慕克实施的迫害之外，不可接受的行为还广泛存在。
In March 2005, the police violently disrupted a demonstration to celebrate International Women’s Day. In May, the largest teachers’ union was banned for promoting the education of Turkey’s 14 million Kurds in their own language.	2005年3月，警方曾使用暴力驱散了庆祝国际妇女节的民众游行；5月，最大的教师协会也因为提倡1400万库尔德人使用本民族语言进行教学而被取缔。
Indeed, intolerance goes right to the top of the Turkish government.	实际上，即便是土耳其政府的高层领导也抱有这种狭隘的排异观念。
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gül abruptly cancelled a recent press conference in Copenhagen when he spied a Kurdish journalist in the audience and the Danes refused to evict him.	当土耳其外长Abdullah Gül在最近一次记者招待会上发现一名库尔德人记者，并要求丹麦方面将其驱逐出去，而被拒绝的情况下，他竟然立刻取消了此次记者招待会。
Such actions and attitudes amply justify my dissent of October 2004.	这样的行为和态度足以证明我在2004年10月投反对票是有充分理由的。
But, even if these shortcomings were removed, Turkey should still not be admitted to the EU, because it is not a European country.	但即便这些不完善的地方都得到改进，土耳其还是不应该被准予加入欧盟，因为它根本不是一个欧洲国家。
Christianity, feudalism, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, democracy, and industrialization have made us what we Europeans are, but they have not made Turks who they are.	基督教、王朝制度、文艺复兴、思想启蒙运动、民主和工业化造就了现在的欧洲人，但这些并未能塑造出一个欧洲化的土耳其。
So I am not convinced that reforms in Turkey implemented at the insistence of the European Commission would continue after accession. Indeed, I suspect that there will be backsliding.	因此，我不相信土耳其在欧盟委员会的敦促下所实施的改革会在加入欧盟后继续下去，也十分怀疑将来是否会出现倒退的局面。
Moreover, Turkey’s accession would lead inevitably to that of Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova, and perhaps of Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaïdjan.	不仅如此，土耳其入盟将不可避免的导致乌克兰、白俄罗斯、摩尔多瓦，也许还有格鲁吉亚、亚美尼亚和阿塞拜疆这些国家纷纷入盟。
The first three of these countries are certainly more European than Turkey. Leaving the three Caucasian republics aside but including the successor states to Yugoslavia, this would mean an EU of some 35 members.	前三个国家当然比土耳其更加欧洲化，再撇开后三个高加索地区的共和国不谈，单单把南斯拉夫的继任国包括进去，欧盟就将拥有35个成员国。
What sort of Union would that be?	这会是一个什么样的联盟呢？
The EU is not simply a club of friends.	
It is based on freedom of movement of goods, services, capital, and people. The Commission, as the guardian of the Union’s treaties, must protect these four fundamental freedoms, which means that it must sometimes persuade, and if necessary force, member states to change their laws.	欧盟不单纯是一个盟友俱乐部，它建立在商品、服务、资金和人员自由运转的基础上，这意味着有时它要说服、甚至在必要的情况下强迫某些成员国修改它们自己的法律。
Alcohol policy in Sweden, the Volkswagen-law in Germany, and discrimination against foreign investment funds in France are examples of cases that made the Commission unpopular.	瑞典的酒品政策，德国的大众法以及法国对外国投资的歧视就是欧盟委员会不受欢迎的例证。
But they were necessary.	但这些又是必不可少的。
By the time I left the Commission, I was sitting on a pile of 1,500 such infringement proceedings.	离开欧盟委员会的时候，我面前还堆着多达1500份类似的侵害诉讼。
In short, EU membership entails having to accept incisive measures that deeply affect a state’s internal affairs.	简而言之，欧盟成员国资格要求成员国必须接受某些会给其国内事务管理带来巨大影响的尖锐措施。
That will be impossible with such disparate members.	对于那些观点根本分歧的成员，这些要求是不可能实现的。
The EU would fall victim to what the historian Paul Kennedy calls “imperial overreach.” The EU would become unacceptably diluted.	欧盟可能会因此沦为保罗·肯尼迪所谓“过度扩张”的牺牲品，变得相当脆弱无力。
That is why former French President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing feared that Turkey’s entry would lead to the EU’s breakup, and it is why former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said, “Accession of Turkey would be more than the EU could bear.”	这就是法国前总统吉斯卡尔·德斯坦担心土耳其的加入会导致欧盟解体的原因所在，也是��什么德国前总理赫尔穆特·施密特曾经表示“土耳其的加入将超出欧盟承受能力”的原因。
But the strongest reason to oppose Turkey’s accession is a question of democracy: a majority of the EU’s population simply does not want it.	但是反对土耳其入盟最有力的原因其实是个民主问题：欧盟成员国的大多数公民根本不希望它加入。
	
What Syria Means	叙利亚的意义
NEW DELHI – Syria’s agony has generated a variety of unproductive responses: verbal condemnation of the excesses of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime; disagreements about the wisdom of armed intervention; and all-around confusion about the possibility of finding a viable long-term solution.	新德里—叙利亚的惨象造成了诸多毫无意义的反应：对总统巴沙尔政权暴行的口头谴责；在武装干涉问题上的莫衷一是；以及迟迟得不出形成可行长期解决方案的可能性。
Worse, in this sorry state of affairs, the world may be getting a glimpse of a very ugly future.	更糟糕的是，叙利亚问题上的无法作为可能会让世界的未来极其悲观。
First, let us try to disentangle some of the cat’s cradle of ironies and contradictions that are bedeviling efforts to end the violence in Syria.	首先，让我们试着解开一些让结束叙利亚暴力的努力迟迟得不到进展的讽刺和矛盾之处。
Whereas Syria denies political freedom to its citizens, it tolerates significantly more social freedom than many other Arab countries, particularly Saudi Arabia, which is leading the charge to oust Assad.	叙利亚拒绝给予公民政治自由，但该国社会自由其实要胜过许多其他阿拉伯国家，特别是沙特，而沙特正是驱逐巴沙尔的领导者。
Governed by minority Alawites (a Shia sect), Syria harbors a kaleidoscope of distinct groups: Arabs, Armenians, Christians, Kurds, Druze, Ismailis, and Bedouin.	叙利亚的政权掌握在占少数的阿拉维派（属于什叶派）手中，其国内存在数量极多的截然不同的集团：阿拉伯人、亚美尼亚人、基督徒、库尔德人、德鲁兹派、伊斯玛义派，还有贝多因人。
It is this tolerance of cultural and religious diversity that could be endangered if the Sunni-inspired revolt sweeps the country.	正是由于存在如此多样化的文化和宗教共存，才使得逊尼派激起的反抗席卷全国将可能导致危险。
And that is why Syria simultaneously generates revulsion at the regime’s atrocities and fear of what might follow if the regime is defeated.	这也正是叙利亚同时产生对巴沙尔政权的厌恶以及对巴沙尔政权被推翻后会出现何种情景的担心的原因。
In an ancient land such as Syria, there can be no examination of the problems of the present without reflecting upon the past.	在叙利亚这样一个古国，当下的问题所带来的考验一定可以从历史中找到参照物。
History, after all, is always the mother of the present, and geography the progenitor.	毕竟，历史总是当下的源头，而地理乃是源头中的源头。
In his history of the Arab world in the aftermath of World War I, A Peace to End all Peace, David Fromkin suggests that the Middle East today reflects the failure of the European powers to consolidate the political systems that they imposed.	在关于一战之后的阿拉伯世界的著作《用一个和平终结所有和平 》 （ A Peace to End all Peace）中，大卫·弗洛姆金（David Fromkin）指出当下的中东反映了欧洲各大国在整合它们所强加给中东地区的政治制度方面的失败。
Britain and its allies “destroyed the old order,” smashing Turkish rule of the Arabic-speaking Middle East.	英国及其盟国“摧毁了旧秩序 ” ， 推翻了阿拉伯语中东的土耳其统治。
But then they “created countries, nominated rulers, delineated frontiers, [and introduced] a state system” that would not work.	但随后它们“创建了国家，指定了统治者，划定了边境 ， （ 并引入了）国家制度 ” ， 但这并没有奏效。
But, in the wake of the American-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the intervention in Libya, is not the same experiment being repeated almost a century later?	但是，美国领导的伊拉克和阿富汗战争以及对利比亚的干预无非是在近一个世纪后重复相同的实验吗？
That is the question that realistic policymakers should be asking themselves as they ponder what to do in Syria.	这个问题是现实决策者在思考如何解决叙利亚问题时应该扪心自问的。
In August 1919, British Foreign Minister Arthur Balfour summarized the essence of the problem that is now confronting policymakers.	1919年8月，英国外交大臣亚瑟·贝尔福总结了今天困扰着决策者的问题的核心。
“The unhappy truth,” he wrote, “is that France, England, and America have got themselves…so inextricably confused that no…satisfactory answer is now possible.”	“令人不快的事实是 ” ， 他写道 ， “ 法国、英国和美国 … … 陷入了无法解开的困惑，以至于如今找不到 … … 令人满意的答案 。 ”
Does that not sound familiar?	这样的论调难道不是很熟悉吗？
And is not an updated version of Syrian (and then Iraqi) King Faisal’s exhortation to Arabs – “Choose to be either slaves or masters of your own destiny” – echoed in the political pronouncements of new leaders in Egypt and elsewhere.	现如今埃及和其他地区新领导人的政治口号与叙利亚（以及后来的伊拉克）国王费尔撒（King Faisal）对阿拉伯人的训诫如出一辙 — — “要么做奴隶，要么主宰自己的命运 ” 。
And let us examine the actions of the West in 1919 and the years that followed.	我们还可以考察一下1919年西方采取了些什么行动，接下去几年又发生了什么。
The French, as Fromkin reminds us, “shrank Syria, so that they could control it,” rewarding their “Christian allies by swelling the borders of Mount Lebanon with the Bekaa valley, the Mediterranean ports of Tyre, Sidon, Beirut and Tripoli, and…land…north of Palestine.	弗洛姆金提醒我们，法国人“削减了叙利亚领土以便控制它 ” ， “通过扩大黎巴嫩山和毕卡谷（Bekaa valley ） 、 地中海港口泰尔（Tyre ） 、 西顿（Sidon ） 、 贝鲁特和的黎波里以及 … … 巴勒斯坦北部 … … 土地的边境”以奖励他们的“基督徒盟友。
Thousands of Muslims [suddenly] belonged to a state dominated by Christians.”	千万穆斯林（一夜之间）成了由基督徒主导的国家的国民 。 ”
So, as the Oxford historian Margaret Macmillan argues in her book The Peacemakers, Syria’s leaders, remembering these events when Westerners probably did not, “took the opportunity” presented by the Black September crisis of 1970 to send troops to their country’s lost lands.	因此，正如牛津历史学家玛格丽特·麦克米兰（Margaret Macmillan）在其著作《和平缔造者 》 （ The Peacemaker）中所指出的，在西方人忘记这些事情的时候，叙利亚领导人还记着 ， “ 利用”1970年黑色9月危机所创造的“机会”向该国失去的领土派遣军队。
The combination of ethnic and sectarian fears and rivalries, historical memories, and willful blindness among outside powers seems almost predestined to destabilize the entire Middle East again.	血统和信仰的担心和对立、历史记忆以及外部大国的视而不见，这些因素组合在一起，几乎早就注定了再次动摇整个中东的宿命。
Turkey is resurgent yet troubled; Iraq has been invaded and abandoned; Iran is isolated and threatened; Israel is anxious and belligerent; and Afghanistan and Pakistan are internally imbalanced and politically fragile.	土耳其有所复苏但仍麻烦缠身；伊拉克被入侵并被抛弃；伊朗被孤立并被威胁；以色列焦虑而好战；而阿富汗和巴基斯坦存在内部失衡，政治上十分脆弱。
Indeed, the great arc stretching from Cairo to the Hindu Kush threatens to become the locus of global disorder.	事实上，从开罗到兴都库什山的大弓形很有可能演变成全球失序轨迹。
Little wonder that Iranian envoy Saeed Jalili, after meeting Assad in Damascus recently, announced that “Iran will absolutely not allow the axis of resistance, of which it considers Syria to be a main pillar, to be broken in any way.”	毫不奇怪，伊朗特使贾里里（Saeed Jalili）在最近于大马士革会见巴沙尔后宣称“伊朗绝不会坐视以叙利亚为主要支点之一的防御轴崩溃 。 ”
For Turkey, Syria’s plight is a strategic nightmare, because any breakup of Syria implies the possible rise of a greater Kurdistan, which would raise claims to a great swath of Turkish territory.	对土耳其来说，叙利亚困境是一场战略噩梦，因为叙利亚的分裂意味着大库尔德斯坦的崛起，而库尔德斯坦必然会主张很大一块土耳其领土。
Is there a solution to this grim impasse?	有办法走出这一残酷僵局吗？
Certainly, one will not be found in more United Nations resolutions, which is why US President Barack Obama is now believed to favor a “managed transition” in Syria that would not fatally erode the existing instruments of the Syrian state.	显然，联合国解决方案再多也不行，这也是美国总统奥巴马如今认为应支持叙利亚“有管理的转型”从而不至于毁掉叙利亚现存国家机器的原因。
As Michael Ignatieff has wisely observed, Syria’s crisis has revealed that this is “the moment in which the West should see that the world has truly broken into two.	迈克尔·伊格纳季耶夫（Michael Ignatieff）明锐地观察到，叙利亚危机告诉我们，在“这样一个时刻，西方应该看到世界真的已经一分为二。
A loose alliance of struggling capitalist democracies” is faced by Russia and China.	由挣扎中的资本主义民主国家组成的松散联盟”正面临俄罗斯和中国的挑战。
Western countries’ national interests will no longer determine the moral and political impulses of today’s global community.	西方国家的国家利益不再能够决定当今全球社会的道德和政治动力。
Indeed, whatever the outcome, Syria’s agony has underscored a further irreversible weakening of the West’s dominant global role.	事实上，不论结果如何，叙利亚惨象所体现的是西方对全球主宰力的不可逆转的进一步削弱。
	
Does the West Want What Technology Wants?	西方想要技术想要的吗？
CAMBRIDGE – In many dimensions, today’s West is not at its best.	坎布里奇—从诸多角度看，当今西方不在最佳状态。
Many people are challenging the values of liberal democracy (individual rights and majority rule) and even those of the Enlightenment (reason, science, and truth).	许多人在挑战自由民主价值观（个体权利和多数规则 ） ， 甚至连启蒙精神（理性、科学、真理）也受到了质疑。
Populist parties are channeling such sentiments with considerable electoral success, capitalizing on economic malaise, widening inequality, and rising immigration.	民粹主义政党利用经济萎靡、不平等性扩大和移民数量增多，通过这些情绪赢得了巨大的选举成功。
Technology is often blamed for the social ills underpinning the populist surge.	造成民粹主义兴起的社会病常常被归因到技术头上。
But what about the causal arrow that runs in the opposite direction, from society to technology?	但与之相反的因果链 — — 从社会到技术呢？
In a world where technological progress promises large benefits, the capacity to supply “what technology wants” may determine which economies are positioned for success, and which are bound to go the way of the Spanish, Portuguese, or Ottoman Empires.	技术进步总能带来很大的收益，因此，供应“技术想要的东西”的能力决定了哪些经济体走在了成功的路上，哪些经济体注定会重蹈西班牙、葡萄牙和奥斯曼帝国的覆辙。
Nowadays, that should worry the West more than it worries China.	如今，这应该比中国更加令西方担心。
To ascertain what technology wants requires understanding what it is and how it grows.	要想弄清楚技术想要什么，需要理解它是什么、又是如何成长的。
Technology is really three forms of knowledge: embodied knowledge in tools and materials, codified knowledge in recipes, protocols, and how-to manuals, and tacit knowledge or knowhow in brains.	技术其实是三种知识形式：体现在工具和材料中的知识；写成秘方、协议和说明书的知识；以及大脑中不可言传的知识或技能。
We can have more tools and gadgets, more books and manuals, or more documents at our disposal on the web, but we do not have the capacity at the individual level to cram more stuff into our brains.	在网上，我们可以随心所欲地拥有更多工具和装置，更多书籍和手册，或更多档案，但在个体层面，我们无法往我们的大脑里面塞更多东西。
For technology to grow, it needs to imprint different bits of knowhow in different brains.	技术的成长需要不同的大脑理解不同的知识点。
Societies become more knowledgeable not because individuals know more but because they know different things.	社会变得更加渊博不是因为个体知道了更多，而是因为他们知道同的东西。
But after storing different bits of knowhow in different brains, using knowhow requires bringing those disparate brains back together again.	但在将不同知识点存储在不同大脑后，运用知识需要将这些彼此不相干的大脑再一次组合起来。
No wonder, then, that there are fewer polymaths and Renaissance Men today, and that the number of authors per scientific papers or per patent has been growing fast.	因此，毫不奇怪，今天的博学家越来越少了，而科学论文和专利的平均作者数量却迅速增加。
One trick that technology uses in order to grow is modularization.	技术为了成长所运用的一个诀窍是模块化。
If a product’s components can be compartmentalized in such a way that different teams are good at different modules and a few are good at putting those modules together, each team may need to know less, even as the whole can know more.	如果某个产品的元件能够进行区分，让不同团队擅长不同模块，而另一些团队擅长组装这些模块，那么每个团队都只需要更少的知识，即使总体知识量有所增长。
Consider the following example: Chile is the world’s largest producer of lithium and Japan’s Panasonic is the largest manufacturer of lithium-ion batteries, but it is China’s BAIC that is the largest electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer.	考虑以下例子：智利是世界最大的锂生产国，而日本松下公司是锂离子电池的最大制造商。 但中国的北京汽车是最大的电动汽车生产商。
While America’s Tesla is an admirable company, by 2025 Europe and China are expected to have over ten times more EVs than the US, which also lags far behind in the number of charging stations to support them.	尽管美国的特斯拉公司是一家令人尊敬的公司，但到2025年，欧洲和中国拥有的电动汽车数量将是美国的十倍，而在支持电动汽车的充电站方面，美国也远远落后于欧洲和中国。
This example illustrates two points.	这个例子说明了两点。
First, each module in the value chain benefits from connecting to other modules in the world.	第一，价值链中的每个模块都因为与世界中的其他模块相连而获益。
Modularity creates a logic that is somewhat different from simple economies of scale.	模块化造就了一个与简单的规模经济不尽相同的逻辑。
EVs benefit from innovations in mining and in battery manufacturing, wherever they occur.	电动汽车从矿产和电池制造的创新中获益，不管这些创新来自哪里。
Whoever achieves those innovations will want to connect to the places that use them.	任何实现了这些创新的人都想让它们与它们的使用者联系起来。
A jumbo aircraft literally requires millions of parts, and innovations in any component can have important implications for the plane’s overall design and efficiency.	巨型飞机真的需要数百万个部件，任何一个元件的创新都有可能对飞机的总体设计和效率造成重要影响。
For example, 3-D printing may radically lower the number of parts required by turbine engines and thus significantly reduce their weight (and thus their fuel consumption).	比如，3-D打印大大降低了涡轮发动机所需要的部件数量，从而大大减轻了它们的重量（从而也减少了燃料消耗 ） 。
To exploit these possibilities, innovating companies need to be able to connect to manufacturers elsewhere in a secure manner.	要利用这些可能性，创新公司必须确保能够与其他制造商取得联系。
This is exactly the opposite of what a sunset clause in the North American Free Trade Agreement would accomplish.	这与北美自由贸易协定（NAFTA）的日落条款的效果完全南辕北辙。
And it is why Airbus recently warned that Brexit will have severe negative consequences for the United Kingdom’s aerospace industry.	也正因如此，空中客车公司最近警告英国退欧将给英国航空业带来非常消极的后果。
Modularization requires the ability to tap talent anywhere in the world.	模块化要求你具备从世界各地吸引人才的能力。
In Silicon Valley, over half the science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) workers are foreign-born, and fewer than a fifth were born in California, a state that, with 40 million residents, would rank 36th among the world’s countries.	在硅谷，一大半科学、技术、工程和数学（STEM）工作者为国外出生，只有不到五分之一出生在加利福尼亚州。 而目前仅有4,000万人的加州能够在世界国家排行榜上名列第36。
With US President Donald Trump’s clampdown on immigration, the neighbor to the north put billboards in Silicon Valley that read “H1B Visa Problems?	美国总统特朗普抛出取缔移民的政策后，北边的邻居在硅谷打出广告牌，上书“H1B签证问题？
Think Canada.”	想想加拿大吧 ” 。
But implementing many technologies also requires ingredients that can be provided only through non-market mechanisms, and here governments play a critical role.	但采用大量技术还需要只能通过非市场机制提供的部件，而在这里，政府起到关键作用。
Consider high-speed rail.	以高速铁路为例。
Without government authorization and cooperation, no private company can build a rail line.	如果没有政府的权威和合作，任何私人公司都无法建设一条线路。
Western Europe has more than 14,000 kilometers (8,700 miles) of high-speed rail, and China has over 25,000.	西欧拥有14,000多公里高速铁路，而中国拥有25,000多公里。
The United States claims to have 56 kilometers, in a short stretch that covers less than 8% of the distance between Boston and Washington, DC.	美国号称拥有56公里，位于波士顿和华盛顿之间，只占两地总里程的不到8 % 。
The reason is obvious: this is a technology that, like the electric car, requires a social decision and a government that enables that choice.	原因显而易见：和电动汽车一样，这种技术需要社会决策以及能够成就这一选择的政府。
In short, technology requires a society that connects to the world, both through trade and openness to talent, in order to exploit the gains from modularization.	简言之，技术要求社会与世界连接 — — 包括贸易连接和对人才的开放性 — — 这样才能利用模块化带来的好处。
It also requires a society that is able to develop a shared sense of purpose, one that is deep and powerful enough to direct the government to provide the public goods that new technologies require.	这还要求社会能够产生共同的使命感，这种感觉要深刻和强大到足以引导政府提供新技术所要求的的公共品。
The first requirement is facilitated by a society having a broader and more inclusive sense of who is a member.	对于第一个要求，成员地位包容感更广泛的社会十分有利。
The second is facilitated by a deeper and more meaningful sense of membership.	对于第二个要求，更深和更有意义的成员地位感十分有利。
Developing these attitudes is not easy.	形成这些态度绝非易事。
It requires a civic rather than an ethnic sense of nationhood.	它要求公民的而非种族的民族感。
This is why the stakes in today’s policy debates in the West are not just about values.	因此，眼下西方政策争论所牵涉到的绝不仅限于价值观。
In a competitive world, societies pay dearly for being unable – or unwilling – to deliver what technology wants.	在一个竞争性的世界中，社会将因为无法 — — 或不愿 — — 实现技术想要的东西而付出沉重代价。
The Spanish Empire made the choice to expel the Jews and the Moors from its realm in the late fifteenth century.	十五世纪末，西班牙帝国选择将犹太人和摩尔人驱逐出境。
It tried and failed to impose its intolerance on its dominions in the Low Countries in the sixteenth century.	十六世纪，西班牙试图在其低地国家领土上也采取这一偏隘政策，以失败告终。
But after an 80-year bloody war of independence, the Netherlands emerged as a beacon of tolerance and attracted some of Europe’s greatest talent, from Descartes to Spinoza.	但在经历了80年的流血独立战争后，荷兰崛起为宽容的灯塔，包括从迪卡儿到斯宾诺莎在内的不少欧洲顶尖人才。
Not surprisingly, it became the world’s richest country during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.	毫不奇怪，到了十七和十八世纪，荷兰成为世界最富有的国家。
Today’s populist forces may disregard what technology wants and impose their vision on the world.	今天的民粹主义力量可能会无视技术想要的东西，而将他们的观念横加给世界。
But they will inadvertently leave their societies, just like the US rail system, on a very slow track.	但他们将有意无意地给他们的社会留下慢轨，就像美国的铁路系统。
	
Three New Lessons of the Euro Crisis	欧元危机的三个新教训
WASHINGTON, DC – While some observers argue that the key lesson of the eurozone’s baptism by fire is that greater fiscal and banking integration are needed to sustain the currency union, many economists pointed this out even before the euro’s introduction in 1999.	华盛顿—一些观察者认为欧元区洗礼的关键教训是需要更深入的银行一体化来维持货币联盟，但许多经济学家在1999年引入欧元之前就已经指出了这一点。
The real lessons of the euro crisis lie elsewhere – and they are genuinely new and surprising.	欧元危机的真正教训并不在此，它们不但全新，而且令人惊讶。
The received wisdom about currency unions was that their optimality could be assessed on two grounds.	关于货币联盟的公认智慧是它们的最优性可以用两个问题来评估。
First, were the regions to be united similar or dissimilar in terms of their economies’ vulnerability to external shocks?	首先，组成联盟的地区的经济在应对极端冲击的脆弱性方面是相同还是不同？
The more similar the regions, the more optimal the resulting currency area, because policy responses could be applied uniformly across its entire territory.	越是相同，所组成的货币区越优，因为政策应对措施可以在整个区域内一刀切地使用。
If economic structures were dissimilar, then the second criterion became critical: Were arrangements in place to adjust to asymmetric shocks?	如果经济结构不同，那么第二个标准就变得至关重要：具有调整不对称冲击的安排吗？
The two key arrangements that most economists emphasized were fiscal transfers, which could cushion shocks in badly affected regions, and labor mobility, which would allow workers from such regions to move to less affected ones.	大部分经济学家强调两大关键安排，一是财政转移，它能缓冲受冲击重创的地区；而是劳动力流动性，它让重创地区工人能够迁往受创较轻地区。
The irony here is that the impetus toward currency union was partly a result of the recognition of asymmetries.	讽刺之处在于，从某种意义上说，迈向货币联盟的动力是对不对称的认识。
Thus, in the aftermath of the sterling and lira devaluations of the early 1990’s, with their resulting adverse trade shocks to France and Germany, the lesson that was drawn was that a single currency was needed to prevent such disparate shocks from recurring.	因此，20世纪90年代初英镑和里拉贬值后，法国和德国受到了消极的贸易冲击，人们从中汲取的教训是需要单一货币来防止这类不同冲击再次发生。
But this overlooked a crucial feature of monetary unions: free capital mobility and elimination of currency risk – indispensable attributes of a currency area – could be (and were) the source of asymmetric shocks.	但这忽视了货币联盟的一个关键特征：资本自由流动和货币风险的消除 — — 货币区必不可少的属性 — — 可能成为（也确实成为过）不对称冲击的原因。
Currency unions, in other words, must worry about endogenous as much as exogenous shocks.	换句话说，货币联盟必须不但要考虑外生冲击，也要考虑内生冲击。
Free capital mobility allowed surpluses from large savers such as Germany to flow to capital importers such as Spain, while the perceived elimination of currency risk served to aggravate such flows.	资本的自由流动让盈余从德国等大储蓄国流向西班牙等资本进口国，而货币风险不再的感觉会放大这种资本流。
To investors, Spanish housing assets seemed a great investment, because the forces of economic convergence unleashed by the euro would surely push up their prices – and because there was no peseta that could lose value.	对投资者来说，西班牙房地产资产是伟大的投资，因为欧元所带来的经济趋同的力量必然会提升其价格，也因为西班牙不再有可以贬值的比塞塔。
These capital flows created a boom – and a loss of long-term competitiveness – in some regions, which was followed by an all-too-predictable bust.	这些资本流创造了一些地区的繁荣和长期竞争力损失，随之而来的是意料中的幻灭。
To the extent that monetary and fiscal arrangements fail to reduce or eliminate moral hazard, the risk that capital flows create these endogenous asymmetric shocks will remain commensurately high.	由于货币和财政安排没能抑制或消除道德风险，资本流造成这些内生不对称冲击的风险将继续维持相当高的水平。
A second insight from the case of the eurozone, advanced by the economist Paul de Grauwe, is that currency unions can be prone to self-reinforcing liquidity crises, because some vulnerable parts (Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Italy at various points) lack their own currencies.	关于欧元区危机的第二项洞察 — — 来自经济学家格劳维（Paul de Grauwe ） — —是货币联盟易受自我加强的流动性危机的冲击，因为脆弱部分（不同时点的希腊、西班牙、葡萄牙和意大利）缺少自己的货币。
Until the European Central Bank stepped in last August to become the central bank not just of Germany and France, but also of the distressed peripheral countries, the latter were like emerging-market economies that had borrowed in foreign currency and faced abrupt capital outflows.	直到去年8月，欧洲央行才不再仅仅是德国和法国的央行，也成为外围受困国的央行，后者就像是借入外币贷款、面临突发资本外流的新兴市场经济体。
These “sudden stops,” as the economists Guillermo Calvo and Carmen Reinhart call them, raised risk premiums and weakened the affected countries’ fiscal positions, which in turn increased risk, and so on, creating the vicious downward spiral that characterizes self-reinforcing crises.	经济学家卡尔沃（Guillermo Calvo）和莱因哈特（Carmen Reinhart）称之为“突停 ” ， 突停提高了风险溢价，削弱了受冲击国家的财政状况，而这反过来又反过来增加了风险，如此等等，最后造成了向下的恶性循环，自我循环的危机就此产生。
The most appropriate analogy is with a country like South Korea.	最恰当的比方是韩国。
In the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008, South Korea needed dollars, because its firms had borrowed in dollars that domestic savers could not fully supply.	2008年雷曼兄弟公司倒闭后，韩国需要美元，因为韩国企业借入了无法完全靠本国储蓄者提供的美元。
Thus, it entered into a swap arrangement with the Federal Reserve to guarantee that South Korea’s demand for foreign currency would be met.	于是，韩国与美联储签订了互换安排，韩国的外币需求将得到满足。
Of course, the euro crisis was not just a liquidity crisis.	当然，欧元危机不仅仅是流动性危机。
Several countries in the periphery (Greece, Spain, and Portugal) were responsible for the circumstances that led to and precipitated the crisis, and there may be fundamental solvency issues that need to be addressed even if the liquidity shortfall is addressed.	一些外围国（希腊、西班牙和葡萄牙）对于导致和恶化危机的环境负有责任，即使流动性短缺问题得到了纠正，也有根本性的偿债能力问题需要解决。
Finally, a less well-recognized insight from the euro-crisis concerns the role and impact of a currency union’s dominant members.	最后还有一个不被人重视的欧元危机教训，即货币联盟主导成员的角色和影响。
It is often argued that the United States, as the major reserve-currency issuer, enjoys what then French Finance Minister Valéry Giscard d’Estaing famously called in the 1960’s an “exorbitant privilege,” in the form of lower borrowing costs (a benefit estimated to be worth as much as 80 basis points).	人们常说，美国作为主要储备货币发行者享受着时���法国财政部长德斯坦20世纪60年代的名言 — — “过分特权 ” ， 即更低的借贷成本（据估计，这一好处大约相当于80个基点 ） 。
There was always a downside – previously ignored but now highly salient in our mercantilist era – to this supposed privilege.	想象的特权总有衰败的一天 — — 此前一直被忽视，而在如今的重商主义时代显露无疑。
If investors flock to “safe” US financial assets, these capital flows must keep the dollar significantly stronger that it would be otherwise, which is an unambiguous cost, especially at a time of idle resources and unutilized capacity.	如果投资者涌向“安全”的美国金融资产，这些资本流必然会让美元大幅升值，这毫无疑问是一种成本，特别是在满是闲置资源和闲置产能的时期。
But, in the case of Germany, exorbitant privilege has come without this cost, owing solely to the currency union.	但是，对德国来说，过分特权是无成本的，这完全是因为货币联盟。
Weakness in the periphery has led to capital flowing back to Germany as a regional safe haven, lowering German borrowing costs.	外围国的疲软导致资本流回作为安全港的德国，降低了德国的借贷成本。
But, yoked to weak economies such as Greece, Spain, and Portugal, the euro has also been much weaker than the Deutschemark would have been.	但是，由于希腊、西班牙和葡萄牙等疲软经济体的存在，欧元比德国马克（如果存在）弱势得多。
In effect, Germany has had the double exorbitant privilege of lower borrowing costs and a weaker currency – a feat that a non-monetary-union currency like the US dollar cannot accomplish.	事实上，德国享有着低借贷成本和弱势货币的双重过分特权 — — 这是美元等非货币联盟货币无法享受的。
The future of the eurozone will be determined, above all, by politics.	说到底，欧元区的未来将由政治决定。
But its development so far has forever changed and improved our understanding of currency unions.	但其到目前为止的发展态势永久地改变和改善了我们对货币联盟的理解。
And that will be true regardless of whether the eurozone achieves the closer fiscal and banking arrangements that remain necessary to sustain it.	不管欧元区实现更紧密的财政和银行安排与否 — — 这仍是维系欧元区的必要条件 — — 这一点都是正确的。
	
What the West Can Do	西方的应对之策
TBILISI – Given the tremendous damage that Russia has inflicted on Georgia, it is easy to conclude that the Kremlin has achieved its objectives.	& & & 第比利斯amp#45;amp#45;鉴于俄国已经在格鲁吉亚造成了巨大损失，人们很容易就得出结论说克里姆林宫已经实现了其目标。
But, so far, Russia has failed in its real goal – getting rid of Mikheil Saakashvili, Georgia’s pro-democracy, pro-American president.	但是目前为止，俄国的真实意图没有得逞，也就是把亲民主、亲美的格鲁吉亚总统萨卡什维利赶下台。
To be sure, Russia has tightened its control of the separatist enclaves of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.	& & & 毫无疑问，俄国加紧了其对南奥赛梯和阿布哈兹两块飞地的控制。
It shattered the Georgian military, grievously damaged Georgia’s economy, and stirred up discord within the Western alliance.	俄国击溃了格鲁吉亚军队，重挫其经济并在西方联盟内部引起了不和。
For three years, it has tried every conceivable tactic to bring Saakashvili down – fomenting a domestic uprising, imposing an economic blockade, beefing up its forces in the enclaves, and finally a war.	三年以来，俄国一直以各种可能的手段来推翻萨卡什维利，包括鼓动格鲁吉亚国内叛乱、实行经济禁运、在飞地内增兵，最后是发动战争。
Yet Georgia’s president remains in power.	但是格鲁吉亚总统依旧掌权。
Here in Tbilisi, tension is understandably high.	& & & 第比利斯的局势无疑高度紧张。
Russian tanks are less than 25 miles away, and the wheat fields along the main road to Gori were ablaze, set on fire by Russian troops, as I drove through Russian checkpoints to get to that deserted, occupied city.	俄国坦克就在距离戈里不到25英里的地方。 在我驾车穿过俄军检查站前往被俄军占领、已经是空城的戈里的时候看到交通要道两旁的麦田被俄国士兵放火焚烧。
(Most memorable sight: drunken Russian soldiers in stolen Georgian uniforms – “because they are better than ours.”)	(最为难忘的景象是喝得醉醺醺的俄军穿着偷来的格鲁吉亚军服，他们说那是因为他们军服的要比我们的好。 )
Russia’s invasion of Georgia has reshaped the strategic landscape.	& & & 俄国入侵格鲁吉亚重新描划了战略大局。
But, as the West debates how to “punish Russia,” it is vital to remember that the main front is still in Georgia.	但是，在西方辩论如何“惩罚俄国”之际，主要战线还是在格鲁吉亚。 记住这一点十分重要。
Talk about taking away the 2014 Winter Olympics or ejecting Russia from the G-8 may (or may not) have some effect on the Kremlin, but the most important thing the West can do now is strengthen the government in Tbilisi.	谈论剥夺2014年奥运会的主办权或者把俄国从工业八强集团中驱逐出去对于克里姆林宫而言或许有点效果(或许没有 ) ， 但是西方目前可以做的最为重要的事情就是巩固第比利斯政府。
The equation is simple: if Saakashvili survives, Vladimir Putin loses.	道理很简单，那就是，如果萨卡什维利坚持下来，普京就失败了。
The intense personal hatred between these men overlays two centuries of tortured history between Russia and Georgia.	& & & 萨卡什维利和普京二人之间个人恩怨很深，这掩盖了两国两百年来的仇怨。
Many people report that Putin simply “loses it” when discussing the upstart Saakashvili, who led his country from near bankruptcy into a golden age of economic growth and the world’s highest rate of foreign direct investment relative to GDP.	许多人都说只要一谈到冉冉升起的萨卡什维利，普京就不可耐烦。 而萨卡什维利把格鲁吉亚从破产的边缘带进了经济增长的黄金年代，其外国直接投资占国民生产总值的比例位居世界第一。
All this has been halted by Russian tanks.	所有的这些都被俄军的坦克阻止了。
The Kremlin has probably lost its chance to remove Saakashvili by overt force, although sinister, more stealthy means cannot be ruled out.	& & & 克里姆林宫或许丧失了用公开力量推翻萨卡什维利的机会，但是并不能排除使用阴险、更为狡猾的手段这样去做。
Having just dined with him in a public restaurant, I wish his security was a little tighter.	我刚刚和萨卡什维利在一家公开餐馆吃完晚餐。
(His predecessor, Eduard Shevardnadze, was a near-miss target for several assassination attempts that are widely believed to have been Russian-directed.)	我希望他的保安能够好一点。 (他的前任谢瓦尔德纳泽几次躲过谋杀企图，大家都认为是俄国策划的。
The Kremlin’s best hope now is that Georgia’s economy will crumble, its currency will collapse, and an unhappy populace, encouraged by some opposition leader (perhaps bankrolled by Russia), will force Saakashvili from power.	) & 克里姆林宫希望最好就是格鲁吉亚经济崩溃，货币一钱不值，积怨的民众在反对党领导人(或许得到俄国资助)的鼓励下迫使萨卡什维利下台。
The Western response to this challenge must go beyond rhetoric.	& & & 西方应对这一挑战不能停留在口头。
What matters most right now is massive economic and military assistance.	目前最为重要的是大规模经济和军事援助。
Public commitments to help rebuild Georgia are the best way to prevent Russia from achieving its goal.	公开承诺帮助重建格鲁吉亚是防止俄国实现企图的最佳方式。
Prime Minister Vladimir Gurgenidze estimates that rebuilding railroads, bridges, ports and other infrastructure will cost at least $1 billion; this does not include humanitarian relief, refugee resettlement costs, or rebuilding Georgia’s military.	格鲁吉亚总理古尔格尼泽估计，重建铁路、桥梁、港口以及其他基础设施将会花费至少10亿美元。 这还不包括人道主义援助、重新安置难民或者重建格鲁吉亚军队的费用。
Gurgenidze also foresees negative economic growth, a huge budget deficit, and a collapse of tourism, which was just taking off in this beautiful country.	古尔格尼泽还估计，经济将会倒退，大量的预算赤字以及旅游业萎缩，而旅游业则刚刚在这一美丽的国家起飞。
United States Senator Joseph Biden has called for an immediate $1 billion supplemental appropriation, a proposal quickly endorsed by Barack Obama.	& & & 美国参议员拜登呼吁立即增拨10亿美元，奥巴马立即表示支持。
But the Bush administration has not yet been specific on economic support.	但是布什当局目前对经济援助尚不明确。
Congress will be in session only briefly before the election, and a supplemental appropriation will pass only if President Bush pursues it vigorously as a bipartisan measure.	美国国会在总统选举前只会短暂开会，只有布什总统积极地以两党法案推动，增拨法案才会得以通过。
Even if delayed until next year, its immediate proposal by Bush and endorsement by both presidential candidates would help morale in Georgia.	即使这一法案推迟到明年，布什总统马上提出以及两党总统候选人予以赞同将会帮助格鲁吉亚的士气。
The European Union, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development must match American support.	欧盟、世界银行、国际货币基金组织、欧洲复兴和发展银行都必须响应美国，给予同样的援助。
In the long run, Georgia and Russia must coexist peacefully.	& & & 长远而言，格鲁吉亚和俄国必须和平共处。
Here, Georgia must do its part.	格鲁吉亚必须尽到责任。
Saakashvili, an immensely talented 41-year-old, saved his country from utter collapse in 2003.	41岁的萨卡什维利才华横溢，在2003年把格鲁吉亚从废墟中拯救了出来。
But he must think strategically about the future.	但是他必须对未来做出战略性的思考。
On occasion, he has berated the Europeans for insufficient support – not a good tactic for someone trying to join the EU – and has used rhetoric about Russia that, while understandable, only increases the danger to himself.	& & & 有时，他严加责难欧洲援助不够，这对于想要加入欧盟并不是一个好计策。 他严加抨击俄国，尽管可以理解，但是这只会给他自己增加危险。
Saakashvili cannot pick up his tiny country and move it to Mexico.	萨卡什维利无法把国家打包搬到墨西哥。
He has to manage the situation with greater care.	他不得不更为小心地应对局势。
There will be consequences, of course, for Russia’s relations with the West.	& & & 当然，俄欧关系也会受到影响。
(Bush’s inattentiveness to this Russian threat – dramatically illustrated by his literal embrace of Putin in Beijing as Russian tanks rolled into Georgia – may have led the Kremlin to think it could get away with its invasion.)	(布什对于俄国的威胁不以为然，当俄军坦克开进格鲁吉亚的时候，他在北京几乎拥抱普京极大地表现出这一点。 这或许让克里姆林宫认为他们可以入侵格鲁吉亚而逍遥法外。
While the West will not going to war over Georgia, Russia must understand that it will pay for using force, or the threat of force, against neighbors that were once part of the Soviet space.	)尽管西方不会因为格鲁吉亚而开战，但是俄国必须知道，针对曾经是苏联一部分的邻国使用武力或者威胁使用武力，它就要付出代价。
This is especially true for Ukraine and Azerbaijan, which are likely to be Moscow’s next targets for intimidation.	& & & 这对于乌克兰和阿塞拜疆尤其如此。 这两个国家有可能成为莫斯科下面的恐吓目标。
The rules of the post-Cold War world are changing – but not to the ultimate benefit of Russia, which has underestimated the unifying effect its actions will have on the West.	后冷战时代世界的规则正在改变，但并不是符合俄国的最终利益。 俄国低估了其行动会让西方团结一致的效果。
Exactly how these relationships evolve depends on what each side does in the coming weeks – especially in Georgia.	这些关系究竟如何演变取决于各方在未来数周内特别是在格鲁吉亚如何动作。
	
What to Expect From the 44th President	对第44任总统的期待
NEW YORK – Campaigns, be they political or military, are waged to be won, and the current American presidential campaign is no exception.	纽约－活动，不管是政治的还是军事的，目的都是为了获胜，当前的美国总统竞选活动也不例外。
The Democratic and Republican candidates are doing all they can to distinguish themselves from an unpopular incumbent president and from one another in the remaining weeks before Americans vote.	民主党和共和党的总统候选人在美国人投票之前剩下的几个星期里，都竭尽全力去和不受欢迎的现任总统以及对方区别开来。
For good reason, much attention is focused on foreign policy differences between the two nominees, which in many areas are both obvious and considerable.	许多注意力都被集中到了两位总统候选人外交政策的不同上面，而这在许多方面是既明显又值得注意的，是有充分理由的。
Still, it is possible to discern some similarities between them, in part because some of their disagreements are not as pronounced as they seem, and in part because the constraints that the next president of the United States will face are certain to limit what either man could do in office.	然而，仍然能够在他们之间发现一些相似点，部分是因为他们的差别并不像他们宣称的那样，部分是因为美国下任总统面临的限制因素，肯定会限制不管谁当选后所能做的事情。
Consider Iraq, the most divisive issue in American politics for the past five years.	想想伊拉克，它是过去5年里美国政治中分歧最大的问题。
Barack Obama regularly points out that the decision to go to war was deeply flawed; John McCain emphasizes how much things have turned around since early 2007, when US troop numbers were increased and US strategy revised.	巴拉克·奥巴马经常指出，发动战争的决定是非常错误的；约翰·麦凯恩强调从2007年初期开始，当美国军队数量增加并且美国的策略发生变化时，有多少事情发生了好转。
Observers could be forgiven for thinking that they are speaking about two entirely different conflicts.	如果观察员认为奥巴马和麦凯恩在说两个完全不同的冲突，是可以得到原谅的。
But what about the future?	但是将来呢？
No matter who wins this November, it is clear that Iraq will not dominate US foreign policy in the years ahead to anything near the degree that it has in recent years.	不管今年11月谁获胜，伊拉克在未来几年里都远远不会像在最近几年里那样，支配着美国的外交政策，这是很清楚的。
We are entering the post-Iraq era of American foreign policy.	我们正在进入美国外交政策的后伊拉克时代。
Consistent with this, the US military presence is decreasing.	与此一致，美国在伊拉克的军事存在在下降。
Where the two candidates differ is on the timing and pace of this drawdown, not on its general direction.	两位总统候选人观点不同的地方在于这个下降趋势的时间和节奏，而不是其基本方向。
By contrast, the US commitment to Afghanistan will increase, and troop levels will climb.	与之相对，美国对阿富汗承担的义务将会增加，驻军水平将会上升。
Behind this prediction is a widely shared assessment that the trends in Afghanistan (unlike in Iraq) are negative, and that the US must strengthen its military presence there and revise its strategy if the Taliban are not to gain the upper hand.	在这一预言的背后，是对阿富汗（和伊拉克不同）的趋势在向负面发展，以及如果不想让塔利班占上风，美国必须加强其在阿富汗的军事存在并修正其策略的广泛共识判断。
It is also widely understood that Pakistan has become part of the problem.	人们也普遍认为，巴基斯坦已经成为阿富汗问题的一部分。
Pakistan’s western reaches are now a sanctuary for militias and terrorists that are moving in and out of Afghanistan.	巴基斯坦的西部区域现在是进出阿富汗的武装分子和恐怖分子的避难所。
Here, Barack Obama appears more willing to have the US launch unilateral military raids against terrorists should the opportunity arise.	在此，巴拉克·奥巴马似乎更愿意在时机成熟的情况下，由美国启动单边打击恐怖分子的军事行动。
But whoever is elected will confront difficult choices if a nuclear-armed Pakistan remains unable or unwilling to act as an American partner and meet its responsibilities in the effort against terrorism.	但是，不管谁当选，都将会面临如果拥有核武器的巴基斯坦不能或不愿意当美国的合作伙伴，以及不能或不愿意承担其在打击恐怖主义活动中的责任时的困难选择。
A third area of some consensus (and some distance from George W. Bush) is climate change.	第三个有一些共识（和乔治·沃克·布什有一定距离）的领域是气候变化。
Under the next president, the US will no longer be a drag on international efforts to create a global regime that sets a ceiling on greenhouse gas emissions.	在下任总统任职期间，美国将不再会拖国际社会建立设定最大温室气体排放量的全球体制努力的后腿。
One result of this likely evolution in US policy is that pressure will shift to other countries, particularly China and India, to accept some limits on their own economic behavior.	这个美国政策可能的进步的结果是，压力会转移到其他国家，特别是中国和印度，迫使它们接受对自身的经济行为的一些限制。
A President McCain or Obama will take steps to improve America’s image in the world.	麦凯恩总统或奥巴马总统会采取措施提高美国在世界上的形象。
One of his first decisions will be to implement a ban on all forms of torture.	这个总统的首要任务之一就是禁止对囚犯所有形式的折磨。
Also to be expected early on is a decision to close the facility at Guantánamo Bay, where terrorism suspects have been held for years without trial.	也可以期待在总统上任后不久，就会决定关闭关塔纳摩湾的设施；在关塔纳摩，恐怖嫌疑分子在没有审判的情况下被羁押多年。
Iran is another area where the differences – at least initially – may not be as sharp as the campaign suggests.	伊朗是另一个差别 — — 至少开始是 — — 不像竞选活动显示的那样尖锐的地方。
Both candidates have stressed that an Iran with nuclear weapons would be unacceptable.	两位总统候选人都强调拥有核武器的伊朗是不可接受的。
The victor will almost surely endorse a new diplomatic initiative aimed at ending Iran’s independent ability to enrich uranium.	总统竞选获胜者几乎肯定会签署一个新的旨在结束伊朗独立进行铀浓缩的能力的倡议。
Less clear are the details of such an initiative, or what the US would do if it were to fail.	不太清楚的是这个倡议的细节，或者如果它失败了美国会怎么做。
The candidates’ statements on Iran do suggest two different philosophies of diplomacy.	两位总统候选人对伊朗的申明确实显示了两种不同的外交哲学。
Obama seems to regard meeting with foreign leaders as a normal component of foreign policy, to be employed as one of many tools.	奥巴马似乎认为和外国领导人举行会谈是外交政策正常的组成部分，应该作为许多手段中的一种加以使用。
McCain appears to embrace the view that such meetings are something of a reward, to be offered when preconditions are met (Iran comes to mind) and withdrawn when certain lines are crossed, as Russia was judged to have done this August in Georgia.	麦凯恩的观点似乎认为这样的会谈是一种奖赏，当满足先决条件的时候（想想伊朗）就提供这种奖赏，当越过一定界限的时候就撤回这种奖赏，像有人认为俄罗斯在今年八月份在格鲁吉亚做的那样。
Despite such differences, either would carry out policies closer to those of Bush’s second term than his first.	尽管有这样的区别，但是，无论谁当选都会执行比起布什在第一任期的政策，更接近其第二任期政策的政策。
With a strained military and a struggling economy, the next president will often have little choice other than to talk.	在军队紧张经济困难的情况下，下一任总统经常会除了会谈外，几乎没有选择。
On other issues, such as trade, there are distinctions between the candidates.	在其他问题上，例如贸易，两位总统候选人的观点有明显的区别。
McCain is a stronger advocate of free trade than Obama is.	麦凯恩比奥巴马更强烈地支持自由贸易。
But this difference may have less impact than meets the eye.	但是，这种差异的影响要比表面上看起来小得多。
Congress plays a large role in trade policy, and the near certainty that the Democratic Party’s majority in Congress will grow after the election means that protectionism will grow as well.	议会在贸易政策中起重要作用，在大选后，民主党在议会中的多数席位几乎肯定会增长，这意味着保护主义也会增长。
Difficult economic times will make it hard to generate support for trade pacts, despite the current importance of export-oriented firms for the American economy.	经济困难时期很难产生对贸易协议的支持，尽管当前出口导向型的企业对美国经济非常重要。
There are real and important differences between the two candidates when it comes to how they would approach the world.	当谈到他们会怎样与国际社会相处时，两位总统候选人的观点有真正和重大的区别。
But there are also more similarities than might be evident from the debates and the campaign.	但是，和在辩论和竞选中可能明显表现出来的共同点相比，他们之间也有更多的共同观点。
Aspects of the next president’s foreign policy are there to see if observers read between the lines and take as much note of what is not said as what is.	如果观察员能体会言外之意并大量观察那些没有按照本来面目表述的东西，下任美国总统外交策的观点可以看清楚了。
	
What Went Wrong with America	美国怎么了？
The latest edition of the Pew Global Attitudes Survey shows that favorable opinions of the United States have fallen again in 12 out of 15 countries polled, a sad reflection of a country’s loss of image.	最新一期的佩尤全球态度调查（Pew Global Attitudes Survey）显示：在接受调查的15个国家中，12个国家对美国的欢迎程度再次下降，这反映出美国形象尽失的悲哀。
How can America recover international legitimacy?	美国如何才能重新赢得国际地位？
This is probably one of the most important challenges for today’s world, for America retains a unique power that should be used – and be perceived – as a force for good if global stability is to prevail.	这也许是当今世界最重要的挑战之一，因为如果我们希望全球稳定，美国人所掌握的独一无二的权力就需要被看作¾并且用作¾一种正义的力量。
Nearly two decades after the demise of the Soviet empire, what stands out is a prevailing sense of lost opportunities.	在苏维埃帝国解体近20年后，人们普遍地认为我们已经失去了绝佳的机会。
The US had a unique opportunity at the end of the Cold War to use its benevolent and enlightened superiority to establish a better international order.	冷战结束时，美国曾有过独一无二的机遇，能够利用其自身宽厚、文明的强大优势建立起更为理想的国际秩序。
But, for a combination of political and personal reasons, America lost time under the two presidencies of Bill Clinton.	但是，由于政治原因和自身因素的作用，在比尔·克林顿两次执政期间，这样的机遇被美国白白浪费掉了。
Indeed, during this necessarily short and fragile “unipolar moment,” Clinton probably had an intuition of what America’s new responsibilities should be, but he did not deliver.	实际上，在这短暂脆弱而又不可避免的“单极时刻 ” ， 克林顿或许已经意识到美国所肩负的全新责任，但他却没有能够将其付诸实施。
The defeat of the Democrats in the mid-term elections in 1994, followed by the Monica Lewinsky affair, hampered the effectiveness of one of America’s most energetic and gifted Presidents.	民主党在1994年中期选举中的失利，再加上接踵而至的莫妮卡·莱温斯基事件，使这位精力最为充沛、也最有天分的美国总统效率大打折扣。
That failure was epitomized by the inability to impose a peace agreement on Palestinians and Israelis in 2000.	克林顿的失败集中体现在未能促使巴勒斯坦和以色列在2000年达成和平协议。
By contrast, George W. Bush did not lose time.	与此形成鲜明对照的是，乔治·W·布什没有白白浪费时间。
He did worse: he simply took a wrong turn – and he took it before 9/11, a traumatic event that reinforced, but did not create, America’s Manichean view of itself and its role in the world.	他做得更糟：从根本上选择了错误的方向¾这样的错误在九一一事件之前就已经存在，那次给人们留下巨大创伤的事件并不是美国在全世界扮演摩尼教徒的开始，而只是又一次强化了这种已经存在的趋势。
Three recent examples illustrate what went wrong with America, its loss of unique status, and its growing image as a partisan and unethical, if not destabilizing, force in the world.	不久前发生的三个实例生动地表明了美国的问题所在，美国失去了独一无二的地位，在世人的心目中，美国越来越成为党同伐异、缺乏道德的典范，甚至成为全球稳定的一种破坏力量。
Consider, first, the recent nuclear agreement signed between the US and India.	先来看看不久前美国和印度签署的核问题协定。
In strictly legal terms, there is nothing wrong, since India never signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.	从严格的法律意义上讲，这份协议的签署无可挑剔，因为印度从未在此前签署过《核不扩散条约 》 。
But in psychological and political terms, the deal signed could only be perceived as legitimizing for Iran’s nuclear ambitions, not to mention North Korea’s.	但从心理和政治的角度，它却只能为伊朗的核抱负提供合理的借口，更不要说一直怀有勃勃野心的北朝鲜了。
It was the ultimate proof that the Bush administration does not believe in universal norms.	这份协议最终证明了布什政府根本不认为应当奉行统一的标准。
A “good” country would be treated with extreme leniency, whereas a “bad” country would not.	“好的”国家可以受到极端宽松的对待，而“坏的”国家却不能。
Guantánamo, Abu Ghraib, and more recent war-crimes scandals have done much worse damage to America’s stature.	关塔纳摩、阿布·格莱布和最近发生的更多有关战争犯罪的丑闻对美国声望所造成的影响更为严重。
Regimes that systematically violate human rights have been quick to seize on every episode of US wrongdoing.	每一次令人发指的暴行背后，都隐藏着对人权进行系统性破坏的政治制度。
With its own human rights record in question, the US, which had been the democratic teacher of the post-war world, is in a much weaker position to give lessons and set standards.	随着自身的人权记录受到世人的广泛质疑，二战结束后就一直自诩为世界民主教师的美国早已失去了发号施令和制定标准的资格。
Nor does the appearance of hypocrisy end there.	但表面装出的伪善并未结束。
At a time when “democracy” and “democratization” have become the watchwords of US foreign policy, normalization of diplomatic relations with Gaddafi’s Libya, not to mention leniency towards Egypt and Saudi Arabia hardly boosts America’s credibility.	在这样一个“民主”和“民主化”已经成为美国外交政策口号的年代，与卡扎菲领导的利比亚实现外交关系正常化，更不用说对埃及和沙特阿拉伯的姑息迁就很难对美国的可信度产生任何帮助。
In global terms, the contrast between what America says and what it does has become glaring.	在全球范围内，美国“言”与“行”之间的鲜明反差已经显得极为刺目。
In February 2005, in a major speech in Paris during her first foreign trip as Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice stated America’s ambition in the world.	2005年2月，当选国务卿的康多莉扎·赖斯在巴黎首次发表重要讲话时，道出了美国的全球目标。
She said essentially the following: “The role of the world is to improve the world.	她的讲话大意如下 ： “ 世界的未来将会越变越好。
America, as the most powerful and ethical country in the world, has a unique responsibility to perform.”	美国作为世界上最强大、也最合乎道德标准的国家，对此肩负着独一无二的责任 。 ”
Eighteen months later, the results are falling far short of the goal.	8个月后的结果距离赖斯的目标相去甚远。
On the contrary, the failures of US policy have contributed to reduce the legitimacy of America’s power further.	恰恰相反，美国政策的失败进一步削弱了美国权力的合法性。
Despite the recent death of Zarqawi in Iraq, the situation there, and in Afghanistan, does not justify the continued Bush administration’s optimism.	尽管前不久扎卡维被美军在伊拉克击毙，但伊拉克和阿富汗的局势发展根本不能为布什政府的乐观看法提供理由。
As America’s legitimacy diminishes, new actors are appearing on the world stage – or returning for an encore.	随着美国合法性的不断减退，新的演员已经登上了世界舞台¾或者说再次回到了舞台的中心。
Russia and China today are united not only by their energy deals, but also by both countries’ conviction that their time has come, and that the outside world needs them more than they need the outside world, particularly the US.	今天，将俄国和中国联系在一起的已经不仅仅是两国的能源协议，这两个国家都认定，属于他们的时代已经到来。 世界需要他们更甚于他们需要世界，而美国尤其如此。
In strategic terms, the waning influence of a paralyzed Europe is also very bad news for America.	从战略角度看，陷入瘫痪的欧洲影响力日趋下降，这对美国也十分不利。
The US needs allies now more than ever, for the world is reverting to its pre-war multi-polar state.	美国现在比任何时候都更需要盟友，因为世界已经恢复到了战前的多极化状态。
Of course, given America’s objective military superiority, I would call it “asymmetrical multi-polarity.”	当然，因为美国在客观上拥有军事优势，我把目前的状况称之为“不对称的多极世界 。 ”
But the US is no longer the country that others seek to emulate, or that they look to for global leadership.	但美国已经不再是别国争相仿效的对象，也不再是它们心目中的全球领导者。
It is too early to dismiss America and proclaim the end of an imperial moment.	现在就把美国撇在一边，宣告霸权时代的结束还为时过早。
America retains unique qualities – particularly its ability to rebound.	美国仍然拥有独一无二的素质¾尤其是再次崛起的力量。
The next US president should be able to capitalize on Americans’ fundamental optimism, pragmatism, and activism.	下一任美国总统应该能够充分调动起美国人最根本的乐观主义、实用主义和积极行动的精神。
But he or she will face an uphill struggle to prove to the world that America can be a force for good, a democratic beacon that cares for the planet and that lives up to the standards that it sets for others.	但他或她将会面对一场艰苦的战斗，向世人证明美国可以成为一种正义的力量，一座点亮全球的民主灯塔，忠实地奉行着为其他国家制定的行为标准。
	
What We Owe Egypt	我们欠埃及什么？
CAMBRIDGE – The question that still underlies much thinking about economic development is this: What can we do to kick-start economic growth and reduce poverty around the world?	剑桥 — — 直到现在仍然引发关于经济发展思考的问题是，我们可以做些什么来推动经济增长，减少世界各地的贫困问题？
The “we” is sometimes the World Bank, sometimes the United States and other rich countries, and sometimes professors of development economics and their students huddled in a seminar room.	“我们”有时指的是世界银行，有时指美国和其他富裕国家，有时指发展经济学教授和学生挤在一间会议室上课讨论。
It is on this question that the entire development-aid complex is based.	整个发展援助复杂体系的基础都是集中在这个问题上。
But what has transformed Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya over the last two years has not been efforts by the outside world to improve these societies or their economies, but grassroots social movements intent on changing their countries’ political systems.	但是，过去两年中改变突尼斯、埃及和利比亚的并不是外界为改善这些社团或经济状况而进行的努力，而是旨在改变各自国家的政治制度的基层社会运动。
It started in Tunisia, where the revolution swept President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali’s repressive regime out of power. It then spread to Egypt and Libya, ending Hosni Mubarak’s and Muammar el-Qaddafi’s even more repressive and corrupt regimes.	这项运动开始于突尼斯，该国爆发的革命将总统宰因·阿比丁·本·阿里的专制政权赶下台来，随后蔓延到埃及和利比亚，结束了穆巴拉克和卡扎菲更残暴、更腐败的政权统治。
The people who poured into the streets and risked their lives were fed up with the repression and the poverty that these regimes caused.	那些冲上街道，冒着生命危险示威游行的人受够了这些制度造成的压迫和贫困。
The average Egyptian’s income level, for example, is just 12% of the average American’s, and Egyptians can expect to die 10 years sooner.	例如，埃及的人均收入水平仅为美国的12 ％ ， 埃及人的寿命比美国人短10年。
Fully 20% of the population lives in dire poverty.	20％的人口生活极度贫困。
The protesters in Tahrir Square perceived the cause of Egypt’s poverty in its non-responsive, repressive political system, its corrupt government, and the general lack of equality of opportunity in every sphere of their lives.	塔里尔广场的抗议者认为镇压性的政治制度、腐败的政府以及生活的每个领域普遍缺乏平等机会是导致埃及贫困的原因。
They saw their current leaders as part of the problem, not part of the solution.	他们认为现任领导者是问题的一部分，而不是解决方案的一部分。
By contrast, most outsiders, asking “What can we do?”, emphasized geographic or cultural factors, or some purely economic “poverty trap,” whose effects should be countered by foreign aid and advice.	相比之下，大多数外国人问 ： “ 我们能做些什么 ？ ” ，强调了地域或文化因素或一些纯粹的经济“贫困陷阱 ” ， 其影响应由外国援助和建议应对。
There should be no illusion that the transformation that the protesters started will be smooth.	我们不应该有任何幻想，认为示威者开始的转型将会一帆风顺。
Many previous revolutions have deposed one set of corrupt rulers only to bring in a new bunch who are equally corrupt, vicious, and repressive.	以往的许多革命废黜了腐败的统治者，结果带来的是新的同样腐败、狠毒和镇压的政府。
There is also no guarantee that the previous elites will not be able to re-constitute similar regimes.	同样没有保证以前的精英将无法重新组建类似的政权。
Indeed, the military, the bulwark of Mubarak’s regime, is now in charge in Egypt, and has been repressing, jailing, and killing protesters who dare to stand up.	事实上，穆巴拉克政权的军事堡垒现在控制着埃及，镇压、监禁和杀害敢于站出来的示威者。
Most recently, it has unveiled plans to write a new constitution before the presidential election, and its electoral commission has disqualified 10 of the 23 presidential candidates on flimsy grounds.	最近，在总统大选前，它已经推出了计划准备写一部新宪法，选举委员会以站不住脚的理由将23名总统候选人中的10位取消了资格。
And, if the military loosens the reins, the Muslim Brotherhood could take over and form its own authoritarian, non-representative regime.	而且，如果该军事政权放松缰绳，穆斯林兄弟会将可能接管并组建自己的不代表民众利益的权威政府。
But there are also grounds to be optimistic.	但是也有乐观的理由。
The genie is out of the bottle, and people know that they have the power to topple governments, and, more generally, that their political activism has consequences.	魔鬼已经出了瓶子，人们都知道他们有能力推翻政府。 更普遍的是，他们的政治行动会产生严重的后果。
That is why people have continued to fill Tahrir Square whenever the military has tried to consolidate its power and suppress dissent.	这就是为什么每次军方试图巩固其权力和压制异议者的时候，人们总会涌向塔里尔广场的原因。
Though it is ultimately the Egyptian people who will decide the country’s fate, and whether it can finally take decisive steps towards more inclusive political institutions, this does not mean that outsiders can do nothing.	虽然最终埃及人民将决定国家的命运，埃及政府是否能够采取决定性的步骤，最终走向更加包容性的政治机构，但这并不意味着外人无能为力。
In fact, there is much that “we” can do – even if none of it will be central to the outcome.	事实上，我们可以做的事情有很多 — — 即使这些做法对最终结果起不了多大作用。
For example, the US will again give more than $1.5 billion of aid to Egypt this year.	例如，美国今年将再次给埃及提供超过15亿美元的援助。
But who is receiving that aid?	但是接受援助是对象是谁？
Unfortunately, it is not the people who are trying to change their country’s future, but the Egyptian military and the same politicians who ruled Egypt under the previous regime.	不幸的是，并不是正在试图改变自己国家未来的埃及人民，而是埃及军方和政治家。
The least we owe to the Egyptian people is to stop supporting their repression.	我们坚决不能向埃及人民提供支持，停止本国镇压。
That does not mean cutting foreign aid.	这并不意味着削减外援。
On the contrary, though foreign aid will not by itself transform Egypt’s society or economy, and though some of it will inevitably be wasted and fall into the wrong hands, it can still do some good.	相反，尽管外援本身不会改变埃及的社会或经济状况，虽然有些将不可避免地被浪费，落入坏人之手，但是它仍然可以发挥一些积极作用。
More important, the US and the international community can work to ensure that the bulk of the funds go not to the military and to business-as-usual politicians, but to grassroots causes and groups.	更重要的是，美国和国际社会可以共同努力，确保大量资金不是流向军方和政治家手中，而是基层事业和团体中。
In fact, foreign aid can also be used as a small inducement for national dialogue in Egypt.	事实上，外援也可以用来作为埃及全国对话的一个诱因。
For example, foreign aid could be placed under the stewardship of a committee of representatives from different social factions, including the civil-society groups at the center of the uprising and the Muslim Brotherhood, with the clear understanding that if the committee fails to agree, the aid will not be disbursed.	例如，外援可以一个由不同社会派别组成的管理委员会管理，包括在本次起义中发挥重要作用的民间社会团体和穆斯林兄弟会，人们可以清醒地认识到，如果委员会不同意，援助将不会发放。
This would force the military and the elites to work together with opposition groups that they often attempt to sideline.	这将迫使军方和精英与他们向来不和的反对派团体合作。
Beyond bringing important but politically marginalized groups to the table, such a committee might also produce a demonstration effect, with successful power-sharing in a small setting possibly encouraging power-sharing writ large.	除了带来重要的但政治上被边缘化的群体，这样的一个委员会也可能产生示范效应，成功地在小范围内分享权力，可能��励更大范围内的权力分享。
That may not be the sort of outside intervention that could cure the ills of centuries of repression and underdevelopment overnight, but “we” need to stop searching for a non-existent panacea, and instead do something better than feeding the Egyptian military.	这可能不是那种外部干预，可以彻底消除数世纪以来积累的镇压弊病，但我们需要停止搜寻一种不存在的灵丹妙药，而是做一些比供给埃及军队更好的事情。
	
When Democracies Collide	民主国家间的碰撞
BERLIN – The multipolar nature of today’s international system will again be on display at the upcoming G-20 summit in Los Cabos, Mexico.	柏林— 当今国际制度的多极性质将在即将到来的墨西哥洛斯卡沃斯G20峰会上再次显现。
Global problems are no longer solved, crises managed, or global rules defined, let alone implemented, the old-fashioned way, by a few, mostly Western, powers.	全球问题的解决、危机的治理、全球规则的制定（更不用说执行了）由一小撮强国（绝大部分是西方国家）决定的日子已经一去不复返了。
Incipient great and middle powers, such as India, Brazil, Indonesia, South Korea, Turkey, and South Africa, also demand their say.	崛起的大国和中等国家，比如印度、巴西、印尼、韩国、土耳其和南非，无不要求获得话语权。
Some of these powers are still emerging economies.	这些强国中不乏新兴经济体。
Politically, however, most of them have crossed the threshold that has long limited their access to the kitchen of international decision-making.	但是，从政治上说，这些国家绝大部分已经跨越了长期横亘在它们面前、阻挠它们进入国际决策层的门槛。
The five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (the “P-5”) still defend their right to veto resolutions, and their military power is unmatched.	联合国安理会五大常任理事国 （ “ 五常 ” ） 仍保有否决权，它们在军力上的优势也依然不容撼动。
But they can no longer dispose of sufficient resources, competence, and legitimacy to cope with global challenges or crises on their own.	但它们已不再能够随心所欲地动用充分的资源、能力和哈发行来按自己的路子应对全球性挑战和危机了。
Bipolarity is a thing of the past, and it is unlikely to re-emerge in a new Sino-American “G-2.”	两极时代早已过去，新的中美“G2”复现只是一个传说。
It is equally unlikely for the foreseeable future that any one club of countries, such as the G-7 or G-8, will again assume a quasi-hegemonic position.	同样，在可以预见的未来，形成由一组国家 — — 比如G7和G8 — — 占据准霸权的局面也是不可能的。
Even the G-20 in its current composition may not really represent the forces that can and will shape the twenty-first century.	从现有组成情况看，即使是G20也不能真正代表能够也将决定21世纪地球的力量。
For the Unites States, the European Union, Japan, and other members of the “Old West,” the good news is that most of the emerging powers that are positioning themselves for a more active global role are also democracies.	对美国、欧盟、日本和其他“旧西方”成员来说，好消息是大部分追求更活跃全球角色的新兴强国同样也是民主国家。
Within the G-20, only two states – China and Saudi Arabia – explicitly do not want to be liberal democracies, while a third, Russia, has developed into an autocracy with a democratic façade.	在G20中，只有中国和沙特两个国家明确不希望走自由民主道路，而俄罗斯实行的是独裁为体、民主为表。
The not-so-good news is that these new democratic powers do not necessarily share the Old West’s political agenda.	不太妙的消息是这些新的民主强国并不与旧西方政治日程天然相容。
For example, they differ about climate policies, seeing a threat to development.	比如，它们实施着不同的气候政策，这给发展蒙上了一层阴影。
Similarly, while new middle and great powers do not always agree, they are generally more skeptical of both international sanctions and military interventions.	类似地，尽管新兴中型和大型强国未必同意，但它们从总体上说对国际制裁和军事干预持怀疑态度。
Moreover, some of the most important of these states differ substantially with the US, and often also with the EU, about the right approach toward regional conflicts, especially in the Middle East.	此外，这些国家中最重要者与美国（通常与欧洲也是这样）在关于地区冲突（特别是中东地区）的正确解决之道的问题上存在重大分歧。
Thus, in 2010, the US found itself in a serious diplomatic dispute with Turkey and Brazil about how to resolve the conflict with Iran over its nuclear program.	因此，2010年，在研究怎样化解伊朗核计划导致的冲突时，美国与土耳其和巴西出现了严重的外交争论。
Without actually admitting it, the US was clearly unhappy that these two states tried to play a diplomatic role of their own in the dispute.	美国虽然没有明说，但显然对土巴两国试图在争论中扮演独立角色的做法很不满。
Differences are also apparent where new democratic middle or great powers have formed new groups or clubs, such as the BRICS, together with non-democratic powers.	在新兴中型和大型民主强国与非民主强国形成新集团（如金砖国家）的领域，分歧也显而易见。
India, Brazil, and South Africa are using such formats in a pragmatic way to pursue their interests, or simply to demonstrate their increased international weight.	印度、巴西和南非采取了实用主义，利用这种方式追求自己的利益或用以表明自己日益增加的国际分量。
There is little agreement between them and Russia or China – both P-5 members – with regard to political values or to fundamental questions of international order.	在政治价值和国际秩序的基本问题等方面，它们与俄罗斯和中国（均在五常之列）并无多少共同语言。
Along with many other states in the global South, however, Russia and China tend to defend the principle of non-interference, and they are generally reluctant to support any US or European attempts to project democracy or defend human rights in other countries.	但是，俄罗斯和中国与众多南方国家一道捍卫着不干涉的原则，一般而言，它们对任何美国或欧洲在别国推进民主、捍卫人权的行动都不支持。
Not a few policymakers in the US and in Europe have reacted with astonishment, or even annoyance, to these emerging democratic powers’ attempts to pursue their own agendas on the world stage.	不少美国和欧洲政客对这些新兴民主强国在国际舞台上追求自身利益感到惊讶甚至有些恼怒。
Such reactions partly reflect old thinking rooted in the Cold War, when democratic countries might differ over details, but would agree about the main questions of international politics.	这样的反应部分体现了植根于冷战的旧思维 — — 民主国家尽管在细节上可能存在分歧，但在国际政治的主要问题上保持一致。
Those who pursued a different agenda on substantial matters were either not part of the “democratic camp” or were not important international players.	在本质性问题上追求不同利益者要么不属于“民主阵营 ” ， 要么地位无关紧要。
By contrast, a central feature of today’s globalized, multipolar world is that shared democratic values do not guarantee agreement about substantial questions of international politics.	相反，当今全球化、多极化世界的一大核心特征是共同的民主价值并不能保证国际政治本质问题上的一致性。
The more democracies there are, the more conflicts of interests and differences are likely to emerge between democratic countries.	民主国家越多，民主国家之间产生利益冲突和分歧的可能性就越大。
There is little reason to react with anger when states like Turkey, Brazil, and South Africa set priorities different from those of Europe or the US, or have different views about how to deal with the Arab-Israeli conflict, Iran, development aid, democracy promotion, or environmental protection.	当土耳其、巴西和南非等国家的优先考虑项与欧洲或美国出现不同，或在如何处理阿拉伯-以色列冲突、伊朗、发展援助、促进民主以及环境保护等问题的观点上出现分歧时，没有必要反应过激。
The US example shows clearly that democratic great powers often pursue their interests with little regard for a global common good that others have defined.	美国的例子清晰地表明，民主强国不顾其他国家眼中的全球共同利益一意孤行乃是家常便饭。
In other words, the international order is becoming more pluralistic.	换句话说，国际秩序正在朝多元化发展。
The task for established Western democracies is to accept and cope with such “democratic differences” on the international level, and to seek multilateral coalitions to manage or solve problems.	成熟的西方民主需要接受和处理好国际层面的这些“民主分歧 ” ， 寻求多边联盟治理和解决问题。
In principle, the EU is better positioned than the US (and certainly than China) to take on this task.	从原理上说，欧盟比美国更能承担这一任务（比中国更能承担是肯定的 ） 。
Europeans are well practiced in dealing with differences and shaping consensus among principally like-minded states.	欧洲人在解决分歧、形成原则无甚差异的国家间的共识方面有着更丰富的经验。
That said, Europe needs to learn to be clearer and more transparent about the interests underlying its own policies, rather than suggesting that its positions on a specific subject represent the only rational implementation of democratic values and norms.	欧洲需要学着更明确、更透明的表达自身政策背后的利益诉求，而不是声称自己在某个具体问题上代表着唯一的民主价值和范式的理性实施之道。
	
When France Says No	当法国说“不”
Not long ago, an American political analyst compared France’s loss of influence in Europe following its “No” vote in the 2005 referendum on the EU constitutional treaty with France’s surrender in 1940.	不久以前，一位美国的政治分析家将法国在2005年的全民公决对欧盟宪法公约说“不”以后在欧洲丧失影响力的情况与其在1940年的投降相提并论。
A provocative analogy, but is it apt?	这一类比颇具争议，但它是否贴切呢？
The collapse in 1940 revealed the fragility of France’s democracy and its loss of confidence in the country’s capacity to face outside threats.	1940年的崩溃揭示了法国民主的脆弱和其对自己国家面对外来挑战的信心的丧失。
In rejecting the European constitution, France expressed its fear of, among other things, globalization.	而否决欧盟宪法至少反映了法国对全球化的恐惧。
A better analogy for the No vote was the rejection in 1954 of the treaty to establish a European Defense Community (EDC).	更好的类比是在1954年对建立欧洲防御共同体(EDC)的否决。
In both cases, a major historical mistake was made.	法国在两个案例中都犯了历史性错误。
France had to a large extent initiated both treaties, had managed to get them accepted by its European partners, but in the end vetoed its own undertakings.	在很大程度上，法国都是两个公约的发起国，并成功地使其欧洲伙伴接受了它们，但在最后又用否决票令自己功亏一篑。
Why, in both 1954 and 2005, did the French – in one case the National Assembly, in the other the electorate – reject proposals that France itself had conceived?	为什么，在1954年和2005年，法国—一次是国民会议，一次是选民—否决了法国自己构想的提案呢？
Both projects sought to construct a genuinely supranational Europe.	两个项目都试图建立一个真正超国家的欧洲。
The EDC would have created a European army, in which even German troops would have been included.	EDC本可以建立一支甚至包括德国部队在内的欧洲军队。
The proposed defense treaty was also to be buttressed by plans for a European political community whose main features were to be defined by a constitutional commission made up of members of national parliaments.	提议中的防御公约本来还要通过一个欧洲政治共同体计划来加强。 该共同体的主要特点将会通过一个由各国议会组成的宪法委员会来明确。
In effect, this commission would have been the precursor to the 2003-2004 Convention for the Future of Europe, which, presided over by former French President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing drafted the constitutional treaty.	实际上这一委员会本来会是2003-2004年“欧洲未来大会”的前身。 该大会在法国前总统Valéry Giscard d’Estaing的主持下起草了宪法公约。
The political community of the 1950’s that France had persuaded its five European partners to accept was supposed to absorb both the European Coal and Steel Community and the EDC.	1950年代，法国劝说其五个伙伴接受的政治共同体本来应该吸纳欧洲煤钢共同体和EDC。
It was to have both diplomatic and military powers, as well as a legislative assembly much like today’s European Parliament – just as the 2005 EU constitutional plan would have extended the European Parliament’s powers and created a European minister of foreign affairs.	它本应同时具备外交和军事权力，以及一个与今天的欧洲议会相似的立法会议—正如2005年欧盟宪法计划本应该扩展欧洲议会的权力，并设立欧洲外交部长那样。
But now, as back then, fear and doubt won the day.	但现在，正如当初一样，恐惧和怀疑占了上风。
Political parties and others who mobilized opposition to the EDC feared a remilitarized Germany and a threat to France’s sovereignty.	反对EDC的政党和其他团体担心德国的再军事化和法国的主权受到威胁。
Today, those in France who opposed the EU constitution succeeded in stigmatizing “Europe” as the threat.	当今，在法国反对欧盟宪法的人成功地将“欧洲”打上了威胁的烙印。
They trumpeted France’s invasion by “Polish plumbers,” calling into question Europe’s two principal achievements: the introduction of a single market, which has undeniably boosted the French economy, and EU enlargement, which has done so much to foster democratic transition in new member states.	他们极力渲染法国被“波兰管子工”入侵，质疑欧洲的两项主要成就：单一市场的引入（它毋庸置疑地促进了法国的经济发展）和欧盟扩大（扩盟对新成员国的民主转型提供了强大的推动力 ） 。
But the failure of the referendum in France carries more serious consequences than the EDC’s rejection.	但法国全民公决的失败比否决EDC的后果更为严重。
Back in the 1950’s, the founding nations’ foreign ministers promptly turned to their Belgian colleague, Paul-Henri Spaak, for fresh proposals.	回到1950年代，六个发起国的外交部长很快便转向他们的比利时同僚Paul-Henri Spaak寻求新的提案。
After intensive discussion among the six, and especially between France and Germany, the Treaty of Rome was drawn up and signed within two years of the EDC debacle.	在六国之间，特别是法德之间的激烈讨论之后，起草了《罗马公约 》 ， 并在EDC彻底失败的两年之内签署了该公约。
By contrast, two years after the French and Dutch No votes, there is no sign of a Plan B, despite the claims of the French politicians who helped mobilize the No vote.	相比之下，在法国和荷兰投否决票之后的两年，尽管推动否决的那些法国政客们一再要求，也还没有任何迹象表明有后备计划出台。
Europe’s Franco-German locomotive has broken down and ratification has stopped, even though member states that had yet to ratify the treaty could have completed the process of ratification.	就算还没有批准该公约的成员国本可以完成批准程序，但由于欧洲的法德火车头停车，批准程序也会陷入停滞。
France’s loss of influence in Europe is no longer at stake today, because the notion of influence presupposes that the overriding preoccupation of EU member states is to advance their own national interests.	现今法国在欧洲影响力的丧失已成定论。 因为这种影响力概念的预设前提是欧盟各成员国压倒一切的要务是争取自身的国家利益。
If Europe were only about gaining the upper hand, it would generate perpetual conflict.	如果欧洲只是让各国争强斗狠，那么它就会产生持续不断的冲突。
The reality is that Europe does manage to move ahead, but step by step through mutual compromise.	而现实是虽然要通过彼此妥协来逐步实现，但欧洲还在往前走。
The real question has more to do with France’s credibility and its capacity to remain a driving force in Europe.	真正的问题更多在于法国的公信力和它继续作为欧洲驱动力的能力。
A journalist recently expressed the view that France’s special role in Europe was due to its “centrality,” meaning that the French are, in equal measure, both open to the world and attached to their nation.	一位记者最近表达观点认为法国在欧洲的特殊作用是源于其“中心性 ” ， 即法国人同等地对世界开放而又执著于本国。
They also participate successfully in a market economy while seeking to preserve an egalitarian social model.	他们成功地参与了市场经济，同时又试图保持一种平等主义的社会模式。
The No vote sullied this image of a balanced France.	否决票玷污了法国的平衡形象。
Indeed, the French themselves are among the first to lament their bleak situation, inventing a new concept – “la déclinologie” – to describe this loss of self–confidence.	的确，法国人自己也最先开始哀悼这种凄凉处境，他们发明了一个新概念 - - “la déclinologie ” — 来描述这种自信心的丧失。
Moreover, the No vote has given a new legitimacy to euro-skepticism in other member states.	另外，这张否决票还给予了其它国家的欧洲怀疑主义新的合法性。
To be sure, the rise of populism in Europe was not caused by the French; nationalism is deeply rooted in Europe’s history and has many causes.	确切地说，欧洲民粹主义抬头并不是法国引起的；民族主义在欧洲历史中有深刻的根源，其产生也有多种原因。
But France’s referendum result fueled other European governments’ fears that any new proposal they might put forward to re-launch the EU constitution would fail in the face of domestic and Europe-wide opposition.	但法国全民公决的结果加重了欧洲其它国家政府的担忧。 它们担心提出的任何旨在重新恢复欧盟宪法的新议案都会再次在国内及欧洲范围内的反对势力面前遭遇惨败。
But reducing European aspirations to the goals of Realpolitik is no answer to today’s crisis.	但是削弱欧洲对现实政治目标的渴望并不是当今危机的化解之道。
Europeans need to recognize that strength lies in unity, and that Europe’s integration cannot be guaranteed without a common constitutional framework that promotes a common identity.	欧洲人需要承认团结才有力量。 没有一个推进共同身份的统一宪法框架，欧洲的一体化就得不到保证。
Until we think in terms of European sovereignty, rather than fret over risks to national sovereignty, the present crisis cannot be overcome.	只有我们以欧洲主权的方式来考虑问题，而不是为国家主权而烦恼，目前的危机才能被克服。
	
When India Votes	印度选举之时
KERALA, INDIA – Beginning this month, the largest exercise of the democratic franchise in history will take place, as India n voters head to the polls to elect a new national parliament.	印度，喀拉拉邦－从本月开始，当印度选民走向投票站选举新一届国会的时候，人类历史上规模最大的民主选举活动就开始了。
They have done this 14 times since India gained its independence.	自印度独立以来，印度人已经进行了14次选举。
Each time India has voted has been the world’s largest exercise in electoral democracy.	印度的每一次投票选举，都成为当时世界上规模最大的民主选举活动。
India’s growing population keeps breaking its own record.	印度不断增长的人口不断地刷新着自己以前创下的纪录。
This time, the electorate includes 714 million voters, an increase of 43 million over the previous general election in 2004.	本次的印度选举，选民人数高达7.14亿人，比2004年的前一次普选增加了4300万人。
Votes will be cast in 828,804 polling stations scattered throughout the country for over 5000 candidates from seven national political parties and several state and other parties. The process involves four million electoral officials and 6.1 million police and civilian personnel.	印度选民要在分布在全国的828804个投票站中，为来自七个全国性政党和几个地方性政党的超过5000名候选人投票；整个选举过程涉及400万名负责选举的官员和610万名警察和文职人员。
The numbers involved are so huge that the elections will be staggered over five phases, ending only on May 13, with electoral and security personnel being moved from state to state as polling is concluded in each place.	因为印度选举涉及的人口数量非常庞大，所以被安排分五个阶段进行，于5月13日结束；并且在一个地方的选举结束之后，负责选举的官员和安全人员会从印度的一个邦转移到另一个邦。
Despite the phased voting, the counting takes place nationwide immediately after the last phase, and the results of the elections everywhere will be announced on May 16.	尽管选举是分阶段进行的，但是，在选举的最后阶段结束之后，印度全国范围的选票计算工作将会立即开始，并且各个地区的选举结果都会在5月16日宣布。
A new parliament will be convened on June 2 to elect a national government to succeed the outgoing administration of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.	在6月2日，新一届议会会被召集起来选举新一届政府，以接替即将结束任期的总理曼莫汉·辛格的政府。
India’s elections, conducted by the autonomous (and all-powerful) Election Commission of India , are an extraordinary event, and not just because of their sheer scale.	由独立的（而且是全权的）印度选举委员会组织的印度选举是一项了不起的活动，这样说不仅仅是因为选举的规模巨大，而且还有其他的原因。
It takes the felling of a sizeable forest to furnish enough paper for 714 million ballots, and every election has at least one story of officers battling through snow or jungle, or traveling by elephant and camel, to ensure that the democratic wishes of remote constituents are duly recorded.	为了供应制作7.14亿张选票所需的纸张，印度砍伐了相当多的树木，并且，在每一场选举中，都至少有一个关于负责选举的官员，为了保证边远选区选民的民主愿望得到实时的反映，冒着风雪或穿越密林，或者骑着大象和骆驼开展选举工作的故事。
(There is even one polling booth for a single voter, who lives too far from civilization to travel to another polling station.)	（印度甚至有一个为一名居住在远离现代交通设施而无法到其他投票站进行投票的选民准备的投票站。 ）
Nor is any Indian election complete without the media publishing at least one picture of a female voter whose enthusiasm for the suffrage is undimmed by the fact that she is old, blind, crippled, toothless, purdah-clad, or any combination of the above.	在印度的选举过程中，也总有媒体发表有关女选民的照片：尽管这个女选民年事已高、眼睛失明、身体残疾、牙齿已经掉光、深居简出或者有前述情况中的某几种，但是，其行使选举权的热情并没有因为这些情况而减弱。
The exotica do not end there.	印度选举中的新奇事物到此还没有结束。
Because so many voters are illiterate, India invented the party symbol, so that voters who cannot read the name of their candidate can vote for him or her anyway by recognizing the symbol under which they campaigned.	因为印度有许多选民不识字，所以印度发明了党派标志，以便那些无法阅读候选人名字的选民，能够通过辨认候选人竞选中的标志的方式，来为他或她投票。
Symbols range from the open palm of the ruling Indian National Congress to the lotus of the Bharatiya Janata Party and variants of the hammer and sickle for India’s profusion of Communist parties.	印度选举中的标志包括执政党国民大会党的张开的手掌，人民党的荷花以及多个共产党的锤子和镰刀。
Independent candidates can choose from an assortment of alternatives, ranging from a cricket bat to images of various large animals.	印度的独立候选人可以从许多不同的替代物中选择竞选标志，选择的范围包括了从板球球拍到各种大型动物图片的各种不同的标志。
(Small ones were removed from the list when one candidate, running against another whose symbol was a parrot, wrung the neck of a live parrot at a public meeting to signify what he would do to his rival.)	（因为以鹦鹉为标志的候选人的竞争对手，可以在公开集会中拧断一只活鹦鹉的脖子，以此来表明他要如此这般地击败其竞争对手，所以小型动物被从可选标志的名单中删除了。 ）
India was also the first country to use an indelible stain on the voter’s fingernail to signify that he has already cast his ballot.	印度也是第一个在选民的指甲上使用难以擦掉的痕迹来表明该选民已经投过票的国家。
At every election, someone “discovers” a new chemical that will remove the stain and permit one to vote twice, though this is unlikely to make a great difference in constituencies the size of India’s, where each MP represents more than two million people.	在每一场选举中，总会有人 “发现”一种可以清除这种痕迹的化学物质，从而使有些人投两次票，尽管这不大可能对每个议员代表超过200万人口的印度选区的选举结果产生很大的影响。
Likewise, some distinguished voter invariably claims that his name is missing from the rolls, or that someone has already cast his vote (but usually not both).	同样，也总会有些知名的选民声称其名字不在选民名单之中，或者声称有人已经冒用他的名字投了票（但是，通常这都不是事实 ） 。
In any case, India’s elections have a reputation for honesty.	无论如何，印度的选举是可信的。
In this election, as in previous ones, votes will be cast on electronic voting machines invented in India, which combine the virtues of simplicity, reliability, and ruggedness.	这次选举和以前的选举一样，选票是投到印度发明的电子投票机中的，这种投票机具有简单、可靠和耐用的优点。
The electoral rolls carry photographs of every individual voter, as does each voter’s identity card.	印度选民名单和选民的身份证一样，贴着选民的照片。
The elections have also been increasingly free of violence.	印度选举中的暴力活动也日益减少了。
There was a time when, in certain parts of India, workers could stuff ballot boxes for a candidate and political parties could “capture” polling booths. Electronic voting machines and strict security arrangements have largely eliminated that possibility.	过去，在印度的某些地区，工人可以在投票箱里塞满选一个候选人的选票，政党可以“占领”投票站，但是，现在的电子投票机和严格的安全安排已经基本上消除了这种可能性。
It has been some time since there were reports of the occasional election worker, candidate, or voter being assaulted, kidnapped, or shot.	有关选举中的临时工作人员、候选人或者选民被袭击、绑���或者遭到枪击的报道，已经有一段时间没有见诸报端了。
Nothing (short of the death of a major contender) interrupts the franchise.	已经没有什么（除了主要候选人死亡）能够中断印度的选举了。
Elections are an enduring spectacle of free India, and give foreign journalists the opportunity to remind the world that India is the world’s largest democracy.	选举是自由印度恒久的景观，印度选举也给了外国记者让世界注意到印度是世界上最大的民主国家的机会。
Indeed, Indians now take for granted that elections will take place, that they will be free and fair, and that they will result in actual transfers of power.	事实上，印度人现在理所当然地认为，印度会进行选举，并且选举是自由和公正的，而且会导致真正的权力转移。
There are few developing countries in the world where this is true, and fewer still where poverty and illiteracy are both rife.	在世界上，只有很少的发展中国家有真正自由而公正的选举，而在贫穷且文盲普遍的国发展中国家中，进行自由公正的选举的国家就更少了。
That may be the real miracle of what will occur in India over the next few weeks.	印度接下来几个星期发生的事情，可能是真正的奇迹。
	
The Myth of Khaki Democracy	军事民主的神话
NEW YORK – Egypt and Thailand have little in common, except for one thing.	纽约 — — 埃及和泰国几乎没有什么共同之处，只有一点除外。
In both countries, at different times, educated people who pride themselves on being democrats have ended up applauding military coups against elected governments.	在这两个国家的不同时期，一直以民主人士自居的高学历人士都对推翻民选政府的军事政变击掌称赞。
They had resisted oppressive military regimes for many years.	他们多年来一直苦苦抵制压迫性的军事政权。
But, in Thailand in 2006, as in Egypt last month, they were happy to see their political leaders ousted by force.	但2006年在泰国和上个月在埃及，他们都很乐于看到政治领袖被武力推翻。
This perversity is not without reason.	这种反常也并非毫无道理。
The elected leaders in both countries, Thaksin Shinawatra in Thailand and Mohamed Morsi in Egypt, were good examples of illiberal democrats: they tended to view their electoral success as a mandate to manipulate constitutional norms and behave like autocrats.	两国的当选领袖（泰国的他信·西那瓦和埃及的穆罕默德·穆尔西）都符合非自由民主的特征：他们似乎认为选举成功就有权操纵宪法并实行独裁。
They are not alone in this respect.	他们的例子并非绝无仅有。
In fact, they are probably typical of leaders in countries with little or no history of democratic government.	事实上，他们也许是典型的非民主国家领袖。
Turkey’s prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, is in the same camp.	土耳其总理雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安也属于这一阵营。
And if the leaders of Algeria’s Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) had been allowed to take power in 1991, after their early success in a democratic election, they would almost certainly have been illiberal rulers.	如果1991年阿尔及利亚伊斯兰拯救阵线（FIS）领袖获准在赢得首轮民主选举后执掌权力，他们几乎也肯定会进入非自由统治者的阵营。
(Instead, they were crushed by a military coup, before a second round of elections could take place, triggering a brutal eight-year civil war in which an estimated 200,000 people died.)	（相反，他们在第二轮选举开始前就被一场军事政变所粉碎，由此引发八年的残酷内战导致约200,000人丧生。 ）
The aftermath of the 2006 coup in Thailand was not nearly so bloody.	2006年的泰国政变远没有那么血腥。
But the bitterness lingers among Shinawatra’s supporters – even now, when his sister, Yingluck, is Prime Minister.	但西那瓦支持者心头的痛苦依然挥之不去 — — 即使现任总理职务是的妹妹英拉。
Street violence is a constant threat.	街头暴力的威胁永远存在。
Only the frail and ailing 85-year-old King Bhumibol Adulyadej still functions as a symbol of national cohesion.	只有85岁高龄且体弱多病的普密蓬·阿杜德国王依然是国家团结的象征。
Without him, fighting between the rural poor and the urban elites could quickly erupt again.	没有他，农村贫困人口和城市精英之间也许很快将再次爆发内战。
This does not bode well for Thai democracy.	泰国民主也因此变得凶多吉少。
Another military intervention is the last thing the country needs.	这个国家最不需要的就是再次出现军事干预行动。
In Egypt, things look far worse at the moment.	埃及目前的局势远比泰国更糟。
The leader of the military coup, General Abdul-Fattah al-Sisi, has promised to confront Morsi’s Muslim Brotherhood with maximum force.	军事政变领袖阿卜杜勒·法塔赫·艾尔西西将军承诺要竭尽全力与穆尔西的兄弟会对抗。
In two separate incidents in July, security forces opened fire on supporters of the Brotherhood as they peacefully protested against Morsi’s ouster and arrest, killing almost 200 people.	7月发生了两起安全部队向和平抗议推翻并逮捕穆尔西的兄弟会支持者开火的独立事件，导致近200人丧生。
Secret-police units that were active under former President Hosni Mubarak (and known for their frequent use of torture) are being reconstituted for the first time since the 2011 revolution.	2011年革命后首次对前总统胡斯尼·穆巴拉克手下的秘密警察部队（曾因频繁使用酷刑而闻名于世）进行了重组。
None of this is either democratic or liberal.	上述做法既不民主也不自由。
And yet many Egyptians, including some human-rights activists, have endorsed it.	但却得到了很多埃及人，包括人权活动家的赞同。
One man, who was savagely stomped by a member of the armed forces in Tahrir Square in 2011, now claims that the Egyptian people should “stand together” with the military, and that all Muslim Brotherhood leaders should be arrested.	2011年曾在解放广场（Tahrir Square）遭受军队成员野蛮践踏的某人现在声称埃及人民应当与军队“站在一起 ” ， 逮捕所有穆斯林兄弟会领导人。
A prominent democracy activist, Esraa Abdel Fattah, has denounced Morsi’s party as a gang of foreign-backed terrorists.	著名民主活动家以斯拉·阿卜杜尔·法塔赫用受国外操纵的恐怖势力来谴责穆尔西的政党。
The army leadership is saying the same thing: Special measures, maximum force, and revived security units are all necessary to “fight terrorism.”	军方领导人也遵守同样的口径：特别措施、最大力量和死灰复燃的安全部队在“与恐怖主义的对抗”中都很有必要。
Some foreign commentators have been as deluded as Egyptians who back the coup.	某些外国评论家也像支持政变的埃及人一样受到迷惑。
A well-known Dutch novelist voiced a rather typical response, saying that he didn’t care much what happened to Morsi’s supporters, for they were all “Islamo-fascists” anyway.	一位著名荷兰小说家的反应非常典型，说他根本不在意穆尔西支持者所遭受的待遇，因为反正他们都是“伊斯兰法西斯 ” 。
And foreign governments, including that of the United States, are averting their eyes.	而包括美国在内的外国政府也对暴力行为视而不见。
President Barack Obama’s administration refuses to describe what happened as a “coup.” US Secretary of State John Kerry even claimed that the military was “restoring democracy.”	奥巴马政府拒绝把发生的事件称之为“政变 ” ， 美国国务卿约翰·克里甚至称军队是在“恢复民主 ” 。
There is no doubt that Morsi’s government was inexperienced, often incompetent, and showed little interest in listening to views other than those of its supporters, which were often far from liberal.	穆尔西政府无疑既欠缺经验也欠缺能力，而且对听取支持者（这些人往往与开明想去甚远）以外群体的意见兴趣不大。
But Morsi’s people are not foreign-backed terrorists.	但穆尔西的民众绝不是受外国操纵的恐怖势力。
Nor was Morsi an Egyptian version of Iran’s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.	穆尔西本人也不是埃及版的霍梅尼最高领袖。
The election that brought Morsi to power gave a political voice for the first time to millions of people, many of them poor, uneducated, and religious.	让穆尔西掌权的选举首次让成百上千万贫困、没有文化、笃信宗教的民众有权利进行政治表达。
They may not have been very good democrats, or even particularly tolerant of different views.	他们或许不是合格的民主人士，甚至对不同见解都不懂得宽容。
Many of them had opinions – for example, on the role of women, on sex, and on the place of Islam in public life – that secular liberals find abhorrent.	很多人对妇女地位、性和伊斯兰在公共生活中所起作用的看法在世俗自由主义者眼中都非常可怕。
But silencing these people by force, and calling them foreign-backed terrorists, can have only one result: more violence.	但用武力让这些人闭嘴并将其称为受外国操纵的恐怖分子只能导致暴力这一个结果。
If the outcomes of democratic elections are not respected, people will seek other means to make themselves heard.	如果民主选举的结果得不到尊重，民众只能寻求其他途径来进行表达。
Morsi’s autocratic inclinations may have damaged democracy; taking him out in a coup deals it a mortal blow.	穆尔西的专制倾向可能已经损害了民主，但用政变的形式将其推翻才是民主的致命伤。
How to bridge the gap in developing countries between secular, more or less Westernized urban elites and the rural poor is an old question.	怎样弥合发展中国家相对西化的世俗城市精英和农村贫困人口间的鸿沟恐怕已经是老生常谈了。
One solution is to enforce secular modernization by oppressing the poor and their religious organizations.	方案之一是通过压迫穷人及其宗教团体的方式实现世俗现代化。
Egypt has already endured the harsh rule of secular police states, of both the right and the left.	埃及已经受够了左右两派世俗警察国家的残暴统治。
The other solution is to give democracy a chance.	给民主一次机会则是另外一种解决办法。
This is not possible without allowing some form of religious expression in public life.	不在公共生活中留出某种形式的宗教表达空间是不可能的。
No democracy in the Middle East that fails to take account of Islam will work.	不承认伊斯兰教的民主制度在中东根本行不通。
But, without the freedom to express other views and beliefs, democracy will remain illiberal.	但如果不能自由地表达其他的意见和信仰，民主政体依然不等同于自由。
This is hard for Islamist parties to accept.	这在伊斯兰政党看来很难接受。
Many Islamists may in fact prefer an illiberal to a liberal democracy.	很多伊斯兰教徒可能宁可接受不自由的民主。
But liberals who truly favor democracy must accept that Islamists are entitled to play a political role, too.	但真正热爱民主的自由主义者必须接受伊斯兰教徒也有权发挥政治作用。
The alternative is to revert to illiberal autocracy.	另外一种选择是允许非自由的专制制度复辟。
Applauding the military coup against Morsi makes this the more likely outcome.	为推翻穆尔西的军事政变击节叫好让这种结果变得更有可能。
	
When Marijuana is Legal	当大麻合法化之时
BRISBANE – What will happen if Californians votes this November to legalize marijuana use by any adult over the age of 21 years?	发自布里斯班 — — 如果美国加利福尼亚州全民公决最终通过大麻合法化的提案，允许任何21岁以上成年人吸食大麻的话，那将会是何种状况？
Let’s ignore for the moment the vexed constitutional issues that will be raised if a US state enacts legislation that conflicts with federal law. Let’s focus instead on what may happen if the law changes as the referendum proposes.	让我们把那些关于各州与联邦之间法律冲突的棘手宪政问题暂时放在一边，并将目光聚焦在大麻合法化所可能引发的结果之上。
If we are to believe the referendum’s supporters, all Californians will be winners.	在支持者看来，这项提案将令所有加利福尼亚人得益。
The change will legitimize marijuana’s de facto legal status since passage of Proposition 215 in 1996.	由于大麻的使用在加州1996年第215号提案（又称“同情性使用法案 ” ， 允许某些患者在医生许可下私自种植和使用大麻）通过之后已经取得了某种实质性的合法地位，如今这项法律修改只不过是最终将其写在纸上而已。
It will thus reduce state expenditure on enforcing a widely violated law; remove marijuana growing and selling from the black market; enable any adult who wishes to use marijuana to do so; and introduce a tax on legal marijuana sales that will fill state coffers with revenue that formerly went to illegal growers (so long as there is no large-scale tax evasion).	而此举将为政府节省在查禁大麻方面的执法开支；使大麻的种植和交易公开透明化；满足所有成年吸食者的需求；而对合法大麻征收的销售税则能令从前那些流入非法种植者腰包的钱变成州政府的财政收入（只要不发生大规模逃税现象的话 ） 。
By contrast, opponents predict that the change will increase rates of marijuana use, and thus magnify the harm arising from that use.	与此相反，反对者们则预计这项法案将增加人们的大麻使用量，而该行为所引发的负面效应也会大大增加。
The adverse consequences of greatest concern include more marijuana-related road traffic accidents and deaths; more psychoses and other serious mental health problems among heavy users; and heavier marijuana use by young people, negatively affecting their life chances.	后果主要集中在更多与大麻有关的交通事故和伤亡；大麻滥用者患上精神病以及其他精神疾病的概率增加；以及滥用大麻的青少年前途的影响。
These effects, they argue, will more than offset any gains from tax revenue and savings from law enforcement.	反对者们认为，如果将这些效应的坏处与增加财政收入和节省执法开支的益处相比的话，显然是弊大于利的。
It is difficult to know who is right, because no other country has adopted this policy.	我们很难去分辨孰是孰非，因为至今还未有任何国家通过类似的政策。
The Netherlands, which is popularly believed to have legalized cannabis use along these lines, has in fact tolerated only small-scale retail sales of marijuana in a limited number of coffee shops in its larger cities.	一直被人们视为大麻合法国度的荷兰实际上只允许在其大城市的有限几个咖啡店中小规模地销售大麻。
Marijuana cultivation remains illegal and coffee shop sales are regulated – more strictly in recent years in response to complaints from neighboring countries about “drug tourism.”	大麻种植依然是非法的，而咖啡店的销售则受到管制 — — 且在周边各国纷纷抱怨本国公民赴荷兰享受“毒品之旅”之后，管制也有逐渐收紧之势。
Nevertheless, some broad predictions can be made.	但即便无法借鉴别国经验，某些大概的情况还是可以推测出来的。
First, openly tolerating a market in a previously illegal commodity will expand the number of users, especially if the retail price is lower than the black-market price (as is proposed in the Ammiano Bill currently before the California legislature). Use may not increase immediately, but it will over time, because marijuana will become more freely available, much cheaper (in order to discourage the persistence of a black market), and its use will be implicitly condoned.	首先，让某种非法产品在市场上公开交易的行为将增加该产品使用者的数量，尤其是在零售价低于黑市价之时（早前由加州议会议员阿米亚诺提交给州立法机关的大麻合法化法案也提到了这一点 ） ， 大麻使用量不会在短期内急剧增加，但会随着时间增长，因为获得大麻不仅更容易，而且更廉价了（为了压倒黑市交易 ） ， 而大麻的使用无疑也会得到其他人的认可。
Experience with alcohol suggests that marijuana will be available to underage users (as it is now), whatever the minimum legal age.	在酒类管制方面的经验告诉我们，不管将法定年龄定得多低，大麻都将最终蔓延到那些不符合年龄的人群当中（正如现在这样 ） 。
Thus, legally available cheaper marijuana will probably mean more use by more young people, and probably more daily use later into adulthood.	因此更廉价的合法大麻将会导致更多青年人吸食大麻，并将这种习惯带到成年之后。
In general, the more people who use a drug, the larger the number of problem users there will be (on the reasonable assumption that problem users comprise a fixed proportion of all users).	总的来说，越多人使用一种毒品，那么滥用者的数目也会随之增加（这是基于一种合理假设：全体吸食者中必定存在有特定比例的滥用者，其数量随总吸食者的增加而增加 ） 。
If current estimates are correct, around 10% of users (and one in six who start in adolescence) may become dependent on marijuana – that is, find it difficult to control or discontinue their use.	如果目前的估计是正确的话，大概有10%的使用者（其中1/6在青少年时期就开始吸食）将发展为大麻成瘾 — — 这意味着他们将难以自我控制或者戒除大麻。
A minority of these problem users will seek professional help to quit.	而其中只有一小部分会寻求专业人士的帮助。
Dependent marijuana users are more likely to experience road and workplace accidents (if they drive or work while intoxicated); increased respiratory disease (if they smoke marijuana); exacerbations of some serious mental disorders; and impaired school and work performance.	大麻成瘾者更可能发生交通意外或者工伤（如果他们在吸食大麻后驾车或者工作的话 ） ， 呼吸道疾病的可能性也会增加（如果他们使用吸烟的方式来吸食大麻 ） ； 诱发某些严重精神疾病的可能性剧增；最后使用者的学习或者工作表现都会下降。
It is uncertain how far these adverse effects can be mitigated by preventive measures such as implementing roadside drug-testing programs, persuading users to use vaporizers rather than smoke joints, discouraging young people from using marijuana, and encouraging early treatment for problem users.	目前还不清楚类似公路毒品测试，说服使用者用蒸馏而不是吸烟方式吸食大麻，阻止青年人使用大麻并鼓励滥用者尽早求医等方式能在多大程度上消除这些负面效应。
Experience with alcohol suggests that these approaches may modestly reduce, but not eliminate, the harms associated with use, especially if sellers are allowed to promote their wares.	酒类管理方面的经验表明这些手段将虽然能在一定程度上减少吸食所带来的坏处，且无法完全消灭它，尤其是当大麻销售者被允许推广自己的商品的时候。
Indeed, the scale of any increase in marijuana use will critically depend on how tightly regulated marijuana sales are – how many licensed growers there are, the number of sales outlets, their locations and trading hours, eligibility requirements for use, content of THC (marijuana’s psychoactive ingredient), and how much promotion and advertising is allowed.	事实上，大麻吸食范围的增减与大麻销售的管制力度密切相关 — — 究竟有多少种植者，销售点的数量，营业地点和时间，适度的需求量，大麻所含有的THC（四氢大麻酚，大麻的主要活性致幻成分）成分比例。
If marijuana were allowed to be marketed much like alcohol is now, we could expect more problem users than if it were regulated more like pharmaceutical drugs (say, by requiring users to be licensed; restricting the number of sales locations, hours of sale, and licensed growers; and imposing high rates of taxation on higher-THC marijuana).	如果大麻可以像酒类那样进行市场推广的话，我们将会发现比药房药物管制（比如说要求吸食者出示处方，限制销售点数量，销售时间，为种植者发放执照，并对高THC含量的大麻征重税）更多的滥用者。
It will be a major policy challenge to get this balance right.	在管制和市场之间中找到某个平衡点是非常考验政治智慧的。
Greater restrictions would provide incentives for illegal operators to remain, while less restrictive regulation would discourage black marketeers, but at the price of increasing the number of users and problem users.	更严厉的管制措施固然会给非法大麻经营者可乘之机，而更宽松的管制虽然能遏制黑市交易，代价却是大麻吸食者和滥用者数量的不断增加。
Marijuana policy involves a choice between the evils of current repressive policies and the evils of increased use under a legal market.	加利福尼亚州其实正面临着一个两难困境：一面是当前过分严厉的政策带来的巨大政府开支和社会犯罪，二是合法交易后吸食者增加所带来的负面影响，而大麻政策则试图两害相权取其轻。
Californians will have to decide how much weight to give to respect for adult liberty, protection of minors, avoidance of a large-scale black market, fiscal considerations, and protection of marijuana users’ health.	加利福尼亚人必须要在成年人自由权，对少数群体的保护，防止大规模黑市交易，财政因素以及保护大麻使用者的健康之间作出取舍。
If they vote for legalization, it will probably be 20 years or more before anyone can say whether, on balance, they decided wisely.	如果他们最终投票通过这项法案的话，那么至少要等到20年或者更长时间之后，才能下结论说他们的决定是否明智。
	
When Prevention is Better than Relief	当防灾胜于救灾
PRINCETON – When the earthquake and tsunami hit Japan in March, Brian Tucker was in Padang, Indonesia.	普林斯顿 — — 当地震和海啸三月袭击日本时，布莱恩·塔克正待在印尼的巴东。
Tucker was working with a colleague to design a refuge that could save thousands of lives if – or rather, when – a tsunami like the one in 1797 that came out of the Indian Ocean, some 600 miles southeast of where the 2004 Asian tsunami originated, strikes again.	塔克正与同事合作设计一个避难所，如果，或者说一旦印度洋再次发生像1797年那样的海啸，这座避难所有可能挽救数以千计的生命。 1797年海啸的源头位于2004年亚洲海啸源头东南方约600英里处。
Tucker is the founder and president of GeoHazards International, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to reduce death and suffering due to earthquakes in the world’s most vulnerable communities.	塔克是地质灾害国际的创始人兼领导者，地质灾害国际是一家非营利性机构，其目标是减轻世界最弱势群体在地震中遭受的伤亡和痛苦。
Padang is one of those communities.	巴东就属于这样的弱势群体。
Just to its northwest, in Banda Aceh, 160,000 lives were lost in the 2004 tsunami.	就在巴东西北方的班达亚齐，160，000人在2004年海啸中丧生。
Now, geologists say, the fault that triggered that tsunami is most likely to rupture farther south, putting low-lying coastal towns like Padang, with a population of 900,000, at high risk of a major earthquake and tsunami within the next 30 years.	现在地质学家认为导致那次海啸的地质断层最有可能继续向南断裂，致使拥有900,000人口的巴东这样的低洼沿海城镇很可能在未来30年发生海啸和大地震。
In Banda Aceh, the tsunami killed more than half the city’s population.	在班达亚齐，海啸夺去了多半城市居民的生命。
In Padang, according to an estimate by the director of the city’s disaster management office, a similar tsunami could kill more than 400,000 people.	据巴东城镇灾害管理办公室估计，巴东类似规模的海啸可能杀死超过400,000人。
Tucker says that he has stood on the beach in Padang, looking out at the ocean and trying to imagine what it would be like to see a five-meter-high wall of water stretching across the horizon, bearing down on the city.	塔克说他曾经站在巴东的海滩上遥望大海，想象一堵高达5米的水墙在地平线上伸展并向这座城市逼近。
Now that we have seen the footage of the tsunami that hit Japan, the demands on our imagination have been lessened – except that we have to imagine away the sea walls that Japan had built to reduce the impact of the tsunami.	看过日本海啸的镜头之后，想像的难度已经大大降低 — — 只有一点，我们必须想像没有日本修建的海啸防波堤会是什么样子。
True, those walls did not work as well as had been hoped, but Japan was nonetheless much better prepared for a tsunami than Padang is.	没错，那些防波堤是没有起到人们预想的作用，但即便如此日本的海啸预防工作也远比巴东充分。
In Padang, even with advance warning of a tsunami, higher ground is too far away, and the narrow streets too choked with traffic, for many people to get to safety in time.	即使巴东成功发布了海啸预警，高地也距离太远，狭窄的街道交通太过堵塞，以致很多人无法安全脱身。
GeoHazards International is therefore working on a more practical idea, which it calls a Tsunami Evacuation Raised Earth Park (TEREP).	地质灾害国际因此也在积极寻找可行的对策，这就是启动海啸避难高地公园（TEREP）项目。
The idea is to build small hills in low-lying parts of the city, with level tops that could be used as parks or sports fields.	具体地讲就是在城市的低洼地带堆起小山，并将小山的平顶用作公园或者运动场所。
With the few minutes’ warning that an earthquake’s strong shaking would automatically provide, people could walk to a TEREP and be safe above the highest level a tsunami could reach.	这样在地震的剧烈晃动提前几分钟自动发出警报之后，人们就可以走到海啸避难高地公园，在海啸无法波及的地方安然度过灾难时刻。
Such raised earth parks are a low-cost solution to the tsunami danger in low-lying coastal areas.	这样的高地公园是沿海低洼地区应对海啸危险的低成本办法。
They use only local materials, provide a valuable community resource in normal times, and have the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives when a tsunami strikes.	这种办法只需用到当地的材料，它们平时作为一种宝贵的社会资源，而海啸来袭时则可以挽救几十万条生命。
Nevertheless, GeoHazards International lacks the resources to build anything like enough TEREPs to meet the need.	但地质灾害国际却无力修建足够数量的高地公园满足避难需求。
After 20 years of operation, the organization remains tiny, especially when compared to organizations like the Red Cross, which primarily do disaster relief work.	在运营20年后，这家机构相比主要从事救灾工作的红十字会等机构规模依然很小。
People are willing to donate hundreds of millions of dollars to help people after a disaster – even after a disaster in a wealthy country like Japan – but are unwilling to invest anything like the same amount to save lives before a predictable disaster strikes.	即使灾难发生在日本这样的富裕国家，人们也愿意在灾后捐款数百万帮助受灾群众，但他们却不愿在可以预见的灾难来袭之前为避免伤亡投资同样的金额。
One reason for this is that preventing a disaster does not make good television.	原因之一是防灾工作并不引人注目。
People give to identifiable victims.	人们愿意为明确的受害者提供帮助。
If we build raised earth parks, we will never see the people who, but for our aid, would have died; no orphans in desperate need will appear on the nightly news.	但如果修建高地公园，我们永远也不会看到若非我们的援助就可能死去的受害者；晚间新闻里也不会出现嗷嗷待哺的孤儿。
But isn’t it much better to keep parents safe than to help orphans after their parents have been killed?	但保护父母的安全难道不比在父母死后帮助孤儿要好得多？
This is a situation in which we must stretch our imagination, to understand and be motivated by the good that we are doing.	这种情况下我们必须发挥自己的想像，理解自己的善举并为之感到鼓舞。
Unfortunately, not everyone can do that.	遗憾的是，并不是所有人都会这样做。
Another reason why we do not give to prevent disasters should be familiar to anyone who has ever delayed going to the dentist because the prospect of serious pain in the coming weeks or months just wasn’t as motivating as the reluctance to face some more immediate slight discomfort.	如果你曾有过甘冒今后几周或几个月可能剧烈牙痛的危险也不愿立即承受轻微的不适而推迟去看牙医的经历，你或许能够理解人们为什么不愿为防灾工���进行捐助。
We tell ourselves that maybe we won’t get a toothache after all, even though we know that the odds are that we will.	我们告诉自己也许最终不会牙痛，即使我们明明知道牙痛的几率很大。
Most of us are not very good at giving proper weight to future events, especially if they are uncertain.	尤其当未来事件无法确定时，大多数人并不擅长为它们授予适当的权重。
So we may tell ourselves that the geologists could be wrong, and perhaps no tsunami will hit Padang in the next 30 years, and by then perhaps we will have new and better technologies for predicting them, giving people more time to get to higher ground.	于是我们可能告诉自己地质学家也会预测错误，未来三十年中巴东也许不会发生海啸，而真到那时我们可能已经掌握了更新更好的预测技术，让人们有更多时间到高地躲开海啸。
Instead, we should be guided by the best estimates of the chances that an intervention will save lives, as well as by the number of lives that would be saved, and the cost of saving those lives.	我们真正该做的恰恰相反，即以某项措施挽救生命的最佳预估机会、挽救生命数量及挽救生命代价为决策基础。
The evidence suggests that building raised earth parks in places like Padang is very good value indeed.	有证据显示在巴东这样的地区修建高地公园是一项很有价值的举措。
	
When Technophobia Becomes Toxic	当技术恐惧症变得有害之时
STANFORD – During the late 1990’s, a singular phenomenon appeared in countries around the world.	发自斯坦福 — — 1990年代末期在全球范围内出现了一个特殊的现象。
One after another, food and beverage companies capitulated to activists opposed to a promising new technology: the genetic engineering of plants to produce ingredients.	众多食品与饮料生产企业一个接一个地屈服于抗议分子的压力之下，向一个充满前景的新技术 — — 通过基因工程使植物生产出特定成分 — — 说不。
They are still capitulating to this day.	而时至今日，这种状况还依然在持续。
The Japanese brewer Kirin and the Danish brewer Carlsberg eliminated genetically engineered ingredients from their beers.	日本酿酒商麒麟和丹麦酿酒商嘉士伯都将基因改造成份排除在自产的啤酒之外。
In the United States, the fast-food giant McDonald's banned them from its menu; food manufacturers Heinz and Gerber (then a division of Switzerland-based Novartis) dropped them from their baby-food lines; and Frito-Lay demanded that its growers stop planting corn engineered to contain a bacterial protein that confers resistance to insect predation.	在美国，快餐连锁巨头麦当劳的餐单中，食品生产商亨氏还有盖博（当时还是瑞士Novartis公司的一部分）的婴儿食品系列里都不见基因改造成份的身影；零食生产商Frito-Lay也要求为其供应原料的种植者停止种植某一品种的玉米，因为其含有一种通过基因工程改造过的用以防止害虫侵袭的细菌蛋白。
These measures were rationalized in various ways, but the reality is that by yielding to the demands of a minuscule number of disingenuous activists, the companies opted to offer less safe products to consumers, thereby exposing themselves to legal jeopardy.	人们列举了许多种理由来证明上述措施是有必要的，但事实上在向一小撮狡猾的抗议分子屈服的同时，这些企业转而选择向消费者提供更不安全的食品，并因此将自身暴露在法律风险之下。
Every year, innumerable packaged-food products worldwide are withheld or recalled from the market due to the presence of “all natural” contaminants like insect parts, toxic molds, bacteria, and viruses.	每一年都有无数的包装食品因为含有昆虫尸体、有毒霉菌，细菌和病毒等“全天然”成份而被暂停上市或者召回。
Because farming takes place outdoors and in dirt, such contamination is a fact of life.	这是因为种植业大多在尘土飞扬的露天环境中进行，自然也无法避免这类污染。
Over the centuries, the main culprit in mass food poisoning often has been contamination of unprocessed crops by fungal toxins – a risk that is exacerbated when insects attack food crops, opening wounds that allow fungi (molds) to get a foothold.	几个世纪以来，大规模食物中毒事件的最大元凶往往是真菌毒素对未处理谷物的污染 — — 当昆虫侵袭农作物并造成伤口，令真菌（霉菌）得以附着之时，这一风险也随之急剧扩大。
For example, fumonisin and some other fungal toxins are highly toxic, causing esophageal cancer in humans and fatal diseases in livestock that eat infected corn.	比如说，伏马菌素（fumonisin）以及其他真菌都拥有极强毒性，不但会使人类罹患食道癌，还能令其他食用玉米的牲畜患上致命性疾病。
Fumonisin also interferes with the cellular uptake of folic acid, a vitamin that reduces the risk of neural tube defects in developing fetuses, and thus can cause folic acid deficiency – and defects such as spina bifida – even when one’s diet contains what otherwise would be sufficient amounts of the vitamin.	伏马菌素还会阻止细胞对叶酸（一种维生素）的吸收，增加发育中的胎儿出现神经管缺陷的风险，一旦摄入了这类毒素，即便一个人的日常食谱中已经含有足量的该类维生素，也会出现叶酸缺乏症 — — 甚至脊柱裂这样的缺陷。
Many regulatory agencies have therefore established recommended maximum fumonisin levels permitted in food and feed products made from corn.	许多监管机构都因此设立了玉米制食品和饲料中允许存在的伏马菌素最高含量。
The conventional way to meet those standards and prevent the consumption of fungal toxins is simply to test unprocessed and processed grains and discard those found to be contaminated – an approach that is both wasteful and failure-prone.	而达到这些标准并防止摄入真菌毒素的常规做法仅仅是对那些已经/未经处理的谷物进行检查，并抛弃受污染的那部分 — — 但该办法一方面效率很低，另一方面也经常出现纰漏。
But modern technology – specifically, the genetic engineering of plants using recombinant DNA technology (also known as food biotechnology or genetic modification) – offers a way to prevent the problem.	而当今科技 — — 尤其是借助DNA重组技术（也就是植物生物技术或者基因改造）的基因工程改造植物 — — 为这个问题找到了一条解决的途径。
Contrary to the claims of food-biotech critics, who insist that genetically modified crops pose risks (none of which has actually occurred) of new allergens or toxins in the food supply, such products offer the food industry a proven and practical means of tackling the fungal contamination at its source.	虽然那些食品生物技术反对者们对基金改造作物大肆抨击，认为它们存在引入新变应原或者毒素的风险（即便无一得到证实 ） ， 但这类产品却能令食品工业切实有效地从源头上杜绝真菌污染。
An excellent example is corn that is crafted by splicing into commercial varieties a gene (or genes) from a harmless bacterium.	其中一个绝佳例子就是那些被植入了来自某种无害细菌的一个或多个基因的商业化玉米品种。
The bacterial genes express proteins that are toxic to corn-boring insects, but that are harmless to birds, fish, and mammals, including humans. As the modified corn fends off insect pests, it also reduces the levels of the mold Fusarium, thereby reducing the levels of fumonisin.	这些细菌基因的表达会生成一些只对玉米害虫有毒，却对鸟类鱼类以及包括人类在内的哺乳动物无害的蛋白，当这类玉米将害虫拒之门外的时候，自然也能降低镰孢霉菌的感染程度，从而减低伏马菌素的含量。
Indeed, researchers at Iowa State University and the US Department of Agriculture have found that the level of fumonisin in the modified corn is reduced by as much as 80% compared to conventional corn.	事实上，艾奥瓦州立大学以及美国农业部的研究人员都发现这类改造玉米的伏马菌素含量最高能实现80%的下降。
Similarly, an Italian study of weaned piglets that were fed either conventional corn or the same variety modified to synthesize a bacterial protein that confers resistance to insect predation found that the modified variety contained lower levels of fumonisin.	同样一项意大利研究也发现，用可以生成抗害虫细菌蛋白的基因改造玉米喂养的断奶小猪，与那些用未经过改造的同一品种喂养的小猪相比，体内的伏马菌素水平更低。
More importantly, the piglets that consumed the modified corn achieved a greater final weight, a measure of overall health, despite no difference in feed intake between the two groups.	更重要的是，在进食量相同的情况下，改造玉米喂大的小猪体重更重，说明其健康状况更佳。
Given the health benefits – to say nothing of the often higher and more reliable yields – governments should introduce incentives aimed at increasing use of such genetically engineered grains and other crops.	考虑到基因改造农产品在健康方面的好处 — — 更不用说其更高也更可靠的产量 — — 各国政府都应当引入法案促进这类基因改造谷物以及其他作物的推广。
In addition, one would expect public-health advocates to demand that such improved varieties be cultivated and used for food, not unlike requirements that drinking water be chlorinated and fluoridated.	此外也希望公共卫生倡导者们能呼吁种植这类作物并将其加工成食品，就像用氯来为自来水消毒并加入少量氟（以防止儿童蛀牙）那样。
And food producers that are committed to offering the safest and best products to their customers should be competing to get genetically engineered products into the marketplace.	那些致力于向消费者提供更安全更优质食品的生产商也应该努力让基因改造产品进入市场。
Alas, none of this has come to pass.	但遗憾的是，上面没有任何一件事情能成为现实。
Activists continue to mount vocal and tenacious opposition to genetically engineered foods, despite almost 20 years of demonstrated, significant benefits, including reduced use of chemical pesticides (and thus less chemical runoff into waterways), greater use of farming practices that prevent soil erosion, higher profits for farmers, and less fungal contamination.	抗议分子继续将嘈杂而挥之不去的反对之声施加于基因改造食品上 — — 虽然他们20多年的抗议也无法阻止这些技术带来的极大好处：人们得以减少化学杀虫剂的使用（冲刷入河的化学物也随之减少 ） ， 更多地使用农业技术操作来防止土壤退化，农民收入增加，真菌污染程度也有所降低。
Responding to the bleating of activists, policymakers have subjected the testing and commercialization of genetically engineered crops to unscientific and draconian regulations, with dire consequences.	为了回应这些抗议分子的奇谭怪论，政策制定者们将基因工程农作物的测试和商业化都置于毫无科学依据且异常严厉的监管之下，并导致了可怕的后果。
A groundbreaking study of the political economy of agricultural biotechnology concluded that over-regulation causes “delays in the global diffusion of proven technologies, resulting in a lower rate of growth in the global food supply and higher food prices.”	一项对农业生物技术的政治经济影响的突破性研究发现过度监管导致“得到证实的技术在全球范围内的扩散速度减慢，引发世界食品供应量增速偏低以及更高昂的食品价格 ” 。
Current policies also create “disincentives for investing in further research and development, resulting in a slowdown in innovation of second-generation technologies anticipated to introduce broad consumer and environmental benefits.”	当前的政策同时也“阻碍了对进一步技术研究和发展的投资，因此减缓了预计将为消费者和环境带来更广泛好处的第二代技术方面的创新 。 ”
Everyone involved in food production and consumption has suffered: consumers (especially in developing countries) have been subjected to avoidable health risks, and food producers have placed themselves in legal jeopardy for selling products known to have “design defects.”	每个牵涉到食品生产和消费的人都因此而受害：消费者们（尤其是发展中国家）面临着本可避免的健康风险，食品生厂商们则只能销售那些有“设计缺陷”的产品并随时可能背上官司。
Public policy that discriminates against and discourages vital innovations in food production is not policy that has the public’s interest at heart.	由此可见，那些敌视并压制在食品生产方面的重要革新的公共政策并不是真心维护民众利益的政策。
	
The World When the Fed Raises Rates	美联储提高利率之后的世界
VIENNA – The United States Federal Reserve is the world’s most powerful bank, and its most powerful component is the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the twelve men and women who meet eight times a year to determine – essentially by setting interest rates – the monetary policy of the world’s largest economy.	发自维也纳 — — 美联储是全世界最具权势的银行，而其最内部权势最大的部门则是联邦公开市场委员会，委员会的八名成员每年召开8次会议来决定（主要是通过设定利率的方式）这个全世界最大经济体的货币政策。
The last time the Fed raised interest rates was in 2006, before the growth-sapping impact of the global financial crisis persuaded it and other central banks to lower rates effectively to zero and to employ so-called quantitative easing (QE) to pump money into advanced economies.	上次美联储调高利率的时候还是2006年，但随后爆发的全球金融危机导致增长乏力，使其及各国央行只得将实际利率降为0并实施所谓量化宽松政策，将货币注入各发达经济体。
But this year, for the first time since 2007, every advanced economy in the world is growing – including America’s.	但就在今年，也就是2007年以来首次，全球所有发达经济体都同时出现了增长 — — 包括美国。
And that means that the FOMC, fearful of asset bubbles, will at some point decide that America’s interest rates must rise.	而这也意味着在资产泡沫的阴影下，联邦公开市场委员会在某个时点决定调高美国的利率。
That may (or may not, depending on the timing) be good for the US economy, but what will it mean for the rest of the world?	这或许会（或者不会，取决于当时的时机）有益于美国经济，但这对世界其他国家来说又意味着什么呢？
Our research shows why the world, especially emerging countries, will be paying nervous attention.	我们的研究发现了为何全球各地，尤其是新兴经济体，会对此忐忑不安。
In mid-2013, when the Fed announced that it would gradually reduce its unconventional monetary-policy measures (for example, large-scale purchases of mortgage-backed securities), emerging markets suffered large capital outflows.	在2013年中，当美联储宣布将逐渐减少其非常规货币政策手段（例如大规模购买有抵押证券）之时，新兴市场立刻爆发了大规模资金外流。
In other words, when the Fed even hints at tightening monetary policy, other countries suffer. Depending on just how much the FOMC decides to tighten at a future meeting, we foresee negative effects on world GDP in the medium term, not only for emerging markets but also for industrialized economies.	换言之，就算美联储只是暗示会在未来的会议中收紧政策，人们也会预期会对世界GDP产生中期负面效应，无论是新兴经济体还是发达工业国都概莫能外。
Since the Fed started to curb its QE program, there has been constant speculation over just when its current accommodative monetary policy will end.	自从美联储开始收紧其量化宽松政策以来，外界就持续怀疑前者的宽松货币政策将在何时终结。
Market participants, be they lenders or borrowers, know that “easy money” has an expiry date.	市场参与者，无论是放贷者还是借贷者，都知道这些“快钱”迟早要收回。
They can see that after three large asset-purchase programs, the Fed’s balance sheet has more than quadrupled since 2007, totaling about $4.5 trillion in February 2015.	他们发现在三次大规模资产收购之后，美联储的资产负债表规模已经是2007年的四倍，在2015年达到了4.5万亿美元。
However, when assessing what the FOMC intends to do, it is important to bear in mind that the Fed’s mandate is to advance America’s national economic goals.	然而在猜度公开市场委员会的的意图之时，也一定要记住美联储的任务就是推动美国的国家经济目标。
This means that it has to consider not just the desirable rate of inflation (the target is a 2% annual rate), but also the state of the labor market – and its judgment has global implications.	这意味着它不仅仅要考虑合适的通胀率（目标是每年2 % ） ，还得顾及劳动力市场 — — 以及其判断的全球影响。
That is why the Fed’s talk in mid-2013 about a gradual exit from unconventional monetary policy led to a so-called “taper tantrum” among investors, triggering a surge in global volatility and a shift in market sentiment against emerging markets.	这也是为何美联储在2013年中关于逐渐退出非常规货币政策的讲话在投资者中引发了一个所谓“减债恐慌 ” ， 导致全球流动性大减以及对新兴市场的负面情绪。
The question now is whether future changes by the FOMC in the federal funds rate (the interest rate at which banks lend each other their overnight money deposited at the Fed) will have similar, or indeed worse, effects.	如今问题在于公开市场委员对联邦基金利率���各银行互相拆借自身在美联储存款的隔夜利率）的变更会否存在类似（或者实际上更糟糕）的效应。
To narrow any gap between its expectations for the economy and those of the public, the Fed publishes each FOMC member’s view of the range of interest rates that should be expected over the next few years.	为了缩小自身与公众之间对经济的预期差异，美联储公布了每位公开市场委员会成员对未来几年的预期利率范围。
A member with a positive assessment of the US economy’s growth prospects will expect a rise in the federal funds rate; a pessimist will expect the rate to stay close to zero for a longer period.	一位对美国经济增长存在正面预期的委员将会预计联邦基金利率上升；而持悲观态度的则会让更长时期内的利率接近零。
Using information released by the Fed in March, we have constructed two scenarios: “lift-off” is based on the maximum projected interest rates, while “delayed lift-off” is based on the minimum.	利用美联储 在3月公布的信息，我们设想了两个情境 ： “ （火箭）发射”是基于最大的预期利率，而“延迟发射”则基于最低预期。
To see the impact beyond America on GDP, consumer prices, exchange rates, and interest rates, we then apply the scenarios to a total of 36 emerging and advanced economies that together account for 90% of global output.	为了研究对美国之外地区GDP、消费者指数，汇率和利率的影响，我们将这两大情境应用在占全球产出90%的36个新性和发达国家身上。
Assuming a phased rise in the federal funds rate to 4% by 2017, we believe that economic growth in all regions except Latin America will slow in 2016, and then slow even more in 2017.	试想如果在2017年联邦基金利率被阶段性调高到4 % ， 那么除拉丁美洲之外的全球经济增长将在2016年放缓，接着在2017年进一步降速。
The cumulative loss in this “lift-off” scenario is about ten times as large as any lost economic output under the “delayed lift-off” alternative of only minimal changes to rates over the next couple of years.	而这一“发射”情境所带来的累计损失要比尽量减少利率变化的“延迟发射”选项在未来几年内造成的任何GDP损失都大十倍。
Our research shows that any monetary tightening by the Fed will affect the rest of the world, but to differing degrees.	我们的研究证明美联储的任何货币紧缩都将对世界其他地区造成影响，但程度会有所不同。
Those emerging markets that were hit severely during the “taper tantrum” episode – for example, Brazil, Indonesia, and Turkey – will certainly suffer.	那些在“减债恐慌”中受灾最重的新兴市场国家 — — 比如巴西，印尼和土耳其 — — 必定将再次受灾。
But the greatest negative impact will be on countries such as Canada and Mexico, which have close trade links with the US economy or those, like Germany, Japan, and Singapore, that are deeply integrated into the global economy.	但最大的负面效应将出现在加拿大和墨西哥这类与美国有紧密经济联系的国家，或者是德国，日本和新加坡这类深度整合进全球经济的国家。
In other words, though emerging markets – through their dependence on capital inflows – will be at risk when America’s monetary policy eventually returns to “normal,” the same will be true for advanced economies.	换言之，虽然新兴市场国家 — — 由于其对资本流的依赖 — — 会在美国货币政策逐渐恢复“常态”后面临风险，但发达国家也不太可能置身事外。

Ready for a US Rate Hike?	美国加息，你准备好了吗？
MANILA – The possibility that the US Federal Reserve could raise the interest rate for the first time in a decade sent jitters across emerging markets for weeks.	发自马尼拉 — — 美联储可能在近十年来首次加息的消息让一批新兴市场国家连续几周不得安宁。
Though the Fed has now decided to keep its policy rate ‎unchanged, it also stated that a rate hike is still on the table for 2015.	虽然美联储已经决定维持政策利率不变，但表示加息仍在2015年的日程上。
The concern is that countries that are dependent on foreign financing could be hit by sudden outflows of international capital, or that currency depreciation following the Fed hike could raise debt-servicing costs for countries and businesses.	值得关注的是，依赖外国资金的国家可能会受到国际资本突然外流的冲击，或者说美联储加息后的货币贬值可能会提高各国和企业的偿债成本。
Governments in the developing world would be wise to worry less about interest-rate changes in the United States – which, in any case, they cannot control – and think more about policy changes they can make at home to strengthen their economies’ resilience.	对于发展中国家的政府来说，最好少去担心美国利率变化 — — 毕竟谁也没法控制美国怎么做，把思考重点放在调整国家内部政策以加强经济抗波动性才是明智的。
An increase in US interest rates is not necessarily bad news for emerging countries.	美国利率提高对新兴国家来说并不一定是坏消息。
Many developing countries – especially in Asia – are in much better macroeconomic shape than they were just before the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s or at the onset of the 2008 global financial crisis.	如今许多发展中国家 — — 尤其是亚洲各国 — — 的宏观经济形势都比1990年代末亚洲金融危机或是2008年全球金融危机爆发前要更好。
And the Fed is likely to raise rates only if it judges US economic growth to be strong and sustainable, which would be a positive sign for the global economy in general.	美联储只有在判断美国经济增长将保持强劲且持续时才可能提高利率，因为这是全球经济总体表现积极的反映。
Furthermore, a delay in raising rates carries its own dangers, encouraging yield-hungry investors to take larger risks – possibly necessitating a sharper or more abrupt change in interest rates in the future.	此外延迟加息也有其风险，因为这会鼓励渴望收益的投资者冒更大的风险 — — 而这可能会在未来造成更剧烈或更突然的利率变化。
Emerging countries can enhance their resilience to fluctuations in global interest rates by pursuing sound fiscal and monetary policies, continuing necessary structural reforms, and strengthening their financial systems.	新兴国家可以通过追求稳健的财政和货币政策，继续进行必要的结构性改革以及巩固金融体系来增强其对全球利率的抗波动能力。
In particular, recent research suggests four key policy areas in which governments should consider intervening.	特别是最近的研究表明，政府应该考虑在以下四个关键政策领域进行干预。
For starters, countries should embrace policies that favor foreign direct investment (FDI) over inflows that can be withdrawn more quickly, such as foreign bank loans, debt, or equity investments.	首先，国家应该施行有利于那类资金流入可以更迅速撤回的外国直接投资的政策，如外国银行贷款，债务或股权投资。
My research with Hui Tong of the International Monetary Fund shows that countries whose capital inflows that are mainly in the form of FDI tend to be more resilient to foreign financial shocks.	笔者与国际货币基金组织经济学家童晖的研究成果表明，以外国直接投资为主要资本流入形式的国家往往更能抵御外国金融冲击。
When the global financial crisis erupted, countries with high FDI relative to total capital flows tended to experience a less severe liquidity crunch.	当全球金融危机爆发时，外国直接投资相对总资本流动额较高的国家流动性紧缩情况一般不太严重。
Second, exchange rates need to reflect economic fundamentals.	其次，汇率需要反映经济基本面。
But while theory suggests that flexible exchange rates should blunt foreign monetary or financial shocks, in practice, such a currency regime rarely works on its own.	但尽管有理论认为弹性汇率应该可以弱化货币或金融冲击，但在实践中这种汇率制度却很少能自行运作。
Indeed, my research with the Asian Development Bank’s Xuehui Han has shown that when the US raises or lowers interest rates, most developing countries tend to follow suit, even when they have a flexible exchange rate.	事实上，笔者与亚洲开发银行的韩雪辉研究表明，当美国提高或降低利率时，大多数使用弹性汇率的发展中国家往往也会跟风。
The key reason is that they want to avoid large swings in the value of their currency.	关键原因是他们要避免本国币值出现大的波动。
Appreciation can harm competitiveness, while depreciation increases the cost of servicing foreign-currency debt, erodes market confidence, and leads to higher inflation.	升值会损害竞争力，而贬值会增加外币债务的偿还成本，削弱市场信心，并导致更高的通货膨胀。
The notable exceptions to this trend are countries that manage cross-border capital flows, especially the corporate sector’s exposure to foreign-currency debt.	而这一趋势的显著例外是那些管理跨境资本流动，尤其是监管企业部门承担外币债务的国家。
Indeed, certain types of capital-flow management – including limiting domestic debt denominated in foreign currency for both firms and households – have been shown to increase resilience.	事实上，某些类型的资本流动管理 — — 包括限制企业和家庭以外币计价的国内债务 — — 都被证明能增加抗冲击能力。
Third, domestic macroprudential and microprudential policies increase resilience.	第三，国内宏观和微观调控政策可以增加抗冲击能力。
These policies should aim at reducing or eliminating the wedge between activities that are good for individuals, banks, and firms, and those that benefit society as a whole.	这些政策应该是减少或消除对个人、银行、企业和那些有利于社会整体利益的活动之间的脱节状况。
One example of such a policy is to link banks’ mandatory reserve ratios to the speed at which credit is expanding or to the stage of the business cycle.	这类政策的其中一个例子是将银行的法定存款准备金率与信贷业务扩大的速度或商业周期的不同阶段联系起来。
Thus, during periods of expansion, when banks are eager to fund ever more risky borrowers, the reserve ratio rises, curbing potentially disruptive asset bubbles or overinvestment.	因此，在扩张期间，当银行急于向偿付风险更大的借款人贷款时，提升存款准备金率，抑制潜在的破坏性资产泡沫和过度投资。
For those countries capable of designing and implementing prudential regulations, management of cross-border capital flows becomes less useful and less desirable.	对于那些能够设计和实施审慎监管的国家来说，跨境资本流动管理就显得不那么有用也不太可取。
Finally, it is no longer appropriate to judge whether a country’s foreign-currency reserves are adequate based on how many months of imports they can cover.	最后，以覆盖多少个月的进口额来判断一个国家的外汇储备是否足够已不再恰当。
Instead, the question to ask is whether the reserves can comfortably service the public and private sectors’ debt denominated in foreign currencies.	取而代之是要问外汇储备是否可以妥善偿付公共和私营部门以外币计价的债务。
The US will normalize its interest rate policy sooner or later according to its need.	美国按照自身需要来实现利率政策正常化是迟早的事情。
For other countries, it is important to focus on policies that can strengthen resilience to foreign financial or monetary shocks.	因此对其他国家而言，重要的是要把重点放在能增强抵御外国金融或货币冲击的政策上面。
	
When the Yankees Go Home	洋基人回家
ISLAMABAD – Relations between the United States and Pakistan have continued to fray since a US Special Forces team killed Osama bin Laden in a comfortable villa near a major Pakistani military academy.	伊斯兰堡 — — 美国一支特种部队小组在一所知名巴基斯坦军校附近一栋舒适的别墅里杀死奥萨马·本·拉登后，美国和巴基斯坦之间的关系开始不断恶化。
But the tit-for-tat retaliation that has followed the raid reflects deeper sources of mistrust and mutual suspicion.	但袭击后针锋相对的报复行动反应了双方之间更深层次的猜疑和不信任。
The latest round has focused on the alleged activities of the Pakistani military’s powerful intelligence agency, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), in the United States.	在美国，巴基斯坦强大的军方情报机构 — — 三军情报局的所作所为成为新一轮摩擦的焦点。
ISI is accused of watching over the Pakistani diaspora and of sponsoring unregistered lobbyists working to shape congressional opinion.	三军情报局被指监督巴基斯坦人移民，并且出资赞助未经注册的说客影响国会意见。
Indeed, this is not the first time that Pakistan’s relations with the US have been on a slippery slope.	实际上，巴基斯坦和美国关系下滑也不是第一次了。
In 1965, after helping the country to build up its economy and its military strength, the US walked out over the war with India that Pakistan had provoked by sending “freedom fighters” into Kashmir.	1965年，在帮助巴基斯坦提高经济和军事实力后，巴基斯坦派遣“自由战士”进入克什米尔挑起印巴战争导致美国退出。
In 1989, following the Soviet Union’s exit from Afghanistan, the US lost interest in what it now calls AfPak – Afghanistan-Pakistan.	1989年，随着苏联撤出阿富汗，美国对目前所谓的阿富汗巴基斯坦区域失去了兴趣。
The Americans began returning to Pakistan until, in 1998, the Pakistani government decided to follow India in testing an atomic bomb.	直到1998年巴基斯坦政府决定步印度后尘试验原子弹，美国才开始对巴基斯坦的回归。
This led to the imposition of US sanctions – and America’s third exit from Pakistan.	巴基斯坦核试验决策招致美国制裁 — — 以及美国第三次从巴基斯坦撤出。
That situation remained unchanged when Afghanistan-based Al Qaeda struck America on September 11, 2001.	直到2001年9月11日驻阿富汗的基地组织袭击美国之前，一直维持着这样一种形势。
After receiving a “you are either with us or against us” warning from President George W. Bush’s administration, General Pervez Musharraf’s Pakistan decided to side with the US.	在接到乔治·W·布什总统“要么与我们为友、要么为敌”的最后通牒后，巴基斯坦的穆沙拉夫将军决定和美国站在一起。
It severed relations with Afghanistan’s Taliban regime, which it had helped to install five years earlier, and allowed America to use its air space to launch strikes on Afghanistan.	穆沙拉夫政府切断了五年前建立的与阿富汗塔利班组织的联系，并允许美国使用其空军基地对阿富汗发起攻击。
For more than a decade, Pakistan and the US were close allies.	10多年来，巴基斯坦和美国形成了亲密的盟友关系。
Pakistan let the US use its air bases to launch drone attacks on Taliban fighters in Afghanistan and northwestern Pakistan; allowed its territory to be used as a supply route for NATO forces in landlocked Afghanistan; and, less enthusiastically than the US wished, launched military operations against Taliban sanctuaries on the Pakistani side of the porous border with Afghanistan.	巴基斯坦允许美国用其空军基地对阿富汗及巴基斯坦西北部的塔利班战机发动无人机攻击，并允许本国领土被用作北约军队在内陆国家阿富汗的补给线，而且虽然没有表现出美国所希望的那种热情，巴基斯坦依然发动了针对漏洞百出的巴阿边境巴方一侧塔利班避难所的军事袭击。
In return for its help, Pakistan received large doses of economic and military assistance.	作为这种帮助的回报，巴基斯坦得到了大量的经济和军事援助。
According to the US Congress, Pakistan was provided $20 billion in aid between 2001 and 2011.	据美国国会统计，2001到2011年间巴基斯坦得到了200亿美元的援助。
In addition, Congress passed the Kerry-Lugar bill, which promised $7.5 billion in economic aid from 2009-2014.	此外，国会还通过一项克里－卢格法案，承诺从2009－2014年间提供75亿美元的经济援助。
The US also encouraged the International Monetary Fund to give Pakistan emergency financial assistance equivalent to $11 billion, to be disbursed starting in late 2008.	美国还鼓励国际货币基金组织给予巴基斯坦合计110亿美元的紧急财政援助，从2008年下半年开始分批拨付。
This cozy relationship created a “moral hazard” in Pakistan, as the generous flow of US aid insulated the government and military from any sense of urgency about economic reform: some foreign friend would always rescue the country from its perennial shortage of cash.	这种亲密关系在巴基斯坦催生出“道德风险 ” ， 因为美国援助的慷慨流入使政府和军方不再着急推进经济改革：某些外国朋友总能解决巴基斯坦持续出现的现金短缺问题。
So far, that friend has been America, but the US could well pull out of Pakistan for the fourth time in the countries’ turbulent relationship – a threat that several influential figures in the US Congress have already made.	截至目前为止，美国一直扮演着那个朋友的角色，但美国很可能在目前的动荡关系中第四次撤出巴基斯坦 — — 美国国会几位颇有影响的人物已经威胁要这么做。
The dynamic that has brought Pakistan-US relations to this point arguably began on December 1, 2009, when President Barack Obama, announcing a surge in the number of US troops in Afghanistan, also indicated his intention to start pulling back American troops beginning in July 2011 – a pledge that he reiterated two months ago.	导致巴美关系发展到目前地步的事态始于2009年的12月1日，当天巴拉克·奥巴马总统宣布增加驻阿富汗的美军人数，并同时明确他从2011年7月开始撤出美军的意图 — — 他在两个月前又重申了这一承诺。
This alerted Pakistan to the fact that, with the imminent departure of US troops, it would be left alone to fight the insurgency on both sides of its border with Afghanistan.	于是巴基斯坦意识到随着美军撤离迫在眉睫，它将不得不与巴阿边境两侧的叛乱分子独自战斗。
To do that, Pakistan would need help from some of the Afghan Pashtun tribes with which it had developed strong relations during the war against the Soviet Union.	要想独自对抗这些叛乱分子，巴基斯坦需要得到某些阿富汗普什图族的帮助，巴方在对抗苏联的那场战争中与这些普什图部族的关系非常牢固。
The Jalaluddin Haqqani group, which was allowed to base itself in a sanctuary in Pakistan’s North Waziristan tribal agency, was one such ally that Pakistan’s government thought could be used to further its interests in Afghanistan.	被获准驻扎在巴基斯坦北部北瓦济里斯坦的部落机构庇护所的贾拉鲁丁·哈卡尼部落是巴基斯坦政府打算用来维护其在阿富汗利益的盟友。
But the Haqqanis were also the group that threatened the Americans the most.	但哈卡尼同时也是对美国人构成最大威胁的部落。
The US pressed Pakistan to move against them. Pakistan resisted.	美国向巴基斯坦施压对他们采取行动，但遭到巴方的抵制。
And, in the midst of this tussle, the US sent Navy Seals to find Bin Laden at a compound deep in Pakistani territory, informing Pakistan’s government only after the raid was over.	而且在这次争斗同时，美国派遣海豹突击队在深入巴基斯坦境内的一栋建筑中找到本·拉登，而且只在袭击行动结束后才通知了巴基斯坦政府。
Pakistan’s embarrassed military pressed the government to begin distancing itself from the US.	倍感尴尬的巴基斯坦军队迫使政府开始疏远美国。
After the identity of the CIA’s station chief in Pakistan was exposed (probably by Pakistani military officials), America made it known that it had good evidence that a prominent Pakistani journalist was ordered murdered by ISI.	在中情局驻巴基斯坦站长的身份暴露之后（揭发他的可能是巴基斯坦军官 ） ， 美国公开宣称自己掌握充分证据，即著名的巴基斯坦三军情报局下令谋杀了一位著名的巴基斯坦记者。
This time around, the break between the US and Pakistan might not be easily repaired.	这一次，美国和巴基斯坦之间的分歧已经不太可能轻易得到修复。
Pakistan has turned to China for economic and military help, clearly hoping for a less volatile relationship than the one that it has with America.	巴基斯坦已经转而寻求中国的经济和军事援助，显然希望与中国之间的关系能比巴美关系更为稳固。
On one hand, Pakistan is seeking large investments from China to improve its physical infrastructure and exploit its considerable mineral wealth.	一方面，巴基斯坦正在寻求大量的中国投资用以改善本国的基础设施并开发其可观的矿产财富。
On the other hand, the Chinese have been invited to develop Gwadar port on the Balochistan coast, and to use it as a base for their fast-expanding navy.	另一方面，中国应邀在俾路支省海岸修建瓜达尔港，并将该港用于其快速扩张的海军的基地。
While China has not responded to these overtures with the degree of enthusiasm that accompanied them, the Chinese would be happy to fill the strategic vacuum likely to be created by America’s accelerated departure from AfPak.	尽管中国尚未对围绕他们的热情提议做出反应，但他们非常乐于填补美国加速撤离阿富汗巴基斯坦后留下的战略真空。
A major realignment of forces in the region is looming, and, with it, a new round of Asia’s old Great Game.	该地区即将发生重大的力量调整，随着这次力量调整，又会上演新一轮亚洲博弈的戏码。
	
When Women Lead	当女性掌权
MUNICH – Would the world be more peaceful if women were in charge?	慕尼黑—如果让女性来领导，世界会变得更和平吗？
A challenging new book by the Harvard University psychologist Steven Pinker says that the answer is “yes.”	哈佛大学心理学家斯蒂芬·平克（Steven Pinker）的新书对此的回答是“是 ” 。
In The Better Angels of Our Nature, Pinker presents data showing that human violence, while still very much with us today, has been gradually declining.	在《天性善良的天使 》 （ The Better Angels of Our Nature）一书中，平克用大量数据证明，人身暴力虽然仍然困扰着世界，但已呈现出逐渐减少之势。
Moreover, he says, “over the long sweep of history, women have been and will be a pacifying force.	此外，他还宣称“从历史长河看，女性一直是、将来也会继续是和平的动力。
Traditional war is a man’s game: tribal women never band together to raid neighboring villages.”	传统战争是男性之间的游戏：部落中的女成员从来不会联合起来扫荡相邻部落 。 ”
As mothers, women have evolutionary incentives to maintain peaceful conditions in which to nurture their offspring and ensure that their genes survive into the next generation.	作为母亲，女性具有进化性动力维系和平环境，以便更好地哺育后代，确保自己的基因传递下去。
Skeptics immediately reply that women have not made war simply because they have rarely been in power.	质疑者马上就可以反驳说，女性之所以不曾引发战争，只是因为她们很少掌权。
If they were empowered as leaders, the conditions of an anarchic world would force them to make the same bellicose decisions that men do.	如果她们能获得领袖之位，得到权力，那么这个弱肉强食的世界将迫使她们采取与男性一致的好战决策。
Margaret Thatcher, Golda Meir, and Indira Gandhi were powerful women; all of them led their countries to war.	撒切尔夫人、梅厄夫人和英迪拉·甘地都是掌权的女性；在她们的任期内，她们的国家无不对别国开战了。
But it is also true that these women rose to leadership by playing according to the political rules of “a man’s world.”	但不可否认的是，这些女性是顺着“男性世界”的政治规则爬到领导人的位子上的。
It was their success in conforming to male values that enabled their rise to leadership in the first place.	她们首先满足了男性的价值观，这是她们获得领导权的第一步。
In a world in which women held a proportionate share (one-half) of leadership positions, they might behave differently in power.	如果女性能够在领导岗位上顶半边天，那么她们掌权后的行为也许会有所不同。
So we are left with the broader question: does gender really matter in leadership?	因此，我们需要面临更广泛的问题：性别真的能影响领导行为吗？
In terms of stereotypes, various psychological studies show that men gravitate to the hard power of command, while women are collaborative and intuitively understand the soft power of attraction and persuasion.	很多心理学研究表明，男性渴望发号施令的硬权力，而女性更具合作精神，在本能上更理解吸引和说服的软权力。
Americans tend to describe leadership with tough male stereotypes, but recent leadership studies show increased success for what was once considered a “feminine style.”	在美国传统中，领导人总是硬朗的男性形象，但最新的领导力研究表明，曾经被认为是“娘娘腔”的做派，其成功的可能性正在增加。
In information-based societies, networks are replacing hierarchies, and knowledge workers are less deferential.	在一个基于信息的社会中，网络正在代替层级，脑力工作者更加难以驯服了。
Management in a wide range of organizations is changing in the direction of “shared leadership,” and “distributed leadership,” with leaders in the center of a circle rather than atop a pyramid.	大量组织的管理正在朝“共同领导”和“分散领导”的方向转变，其领导层处于圆心，而不是金字塔塔尖。
Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt said that he had to “coddle” his employees.	前谷歌首席执行官施密特（Eric Schmidt）说，他必须“骄纵”手下的雇员。
Even the military faces these changes.	就连军队也面临着这种改变。
In the United States, the Pentagon says that Army drillmasters do “less shouting at everyone,” because today’s generation responds better to instructors who play “a more counseling-type role.”	在美国，五角大楼宣称陆军教官“动辄大吼的情况更少了 ” ， 因为新新一代对“更多扮演导师角色”的教官反应更好。
Military success against terrorists and counterinsurgents requires soldiers to win hearts and minds, not just break buildings and bodies.	从军事上战胜恐怖主义以及反暴动要求士兵能够赢得心理战，而不仅仅是摧毁敌人的工事和肉体。
Former US President George W. Bush once described his role as “the decider,” but there is much more to modern leadership than that.	前美国总统乔治·W·布什曾经将他的角色描述为“决定者 ” ， 但现代领导工作的范围远不止这一点。
Modern leaders must be able to use networks, to collaborate, and to encourage participation.	现代领导人必须能够使用网络，能够协调并鼓舞参与者。
Women’s non-hierarchical style and relational skills fit a leadership need in the new world of knowledge-based organizations and groups that men, on average, are less well prepared to meet.	女性的非层级制风格和公关技巧更适合在当今新涌现的基于知识的组织和团体中担任领导职位，男性（平均而言）还没有做好适应这一变化的准备。
In the past, when women fought their way to the top of organizations, they often had to adopt a “masculine style,” violating the broader social norm of female “niceness.”	过去，当女性奋斗在爬向组织最高宝座之路的时候，她们通常不得不采取一种“阳刚风格 ” ， 打破女性“温柔”的常规社会范式。
Now, however, with the information revolution and democratization demanding more participatory leadership, the “feminine style” is becoming a path to more effective leadership.	但是，如今，信息革命和民主化要求更具参与性的领导，因此“娘娘腔”正在成为更有效率的领导方式。
In order to lead successfully, men will not only have to value this style in their women colleagues, but will also have to master the same skills.	为了获得成功，男性不但必须理解女性同事处事风格的价值，还必须掌握这一技巧。
That is a trend, not (yet) a fact.	这是一个趋势，而（尚）不是既成事实。
Women still lag in leadership positions, holding only 5% of top corporate positions and a minority of positions in elected legislatures (just 16% in the US, for example, compared to 45% in Sweden).	女性仍然在领导职位的竞争中处于劣势，公司首脑中只有5%是女性，议员选举中当选女性也只是少数（比如，美国只有16 % ， 而瑞典达到了45 % ） 。
One study of the 1,941 rulers of independent countries during the twentieth century found only 27 women, roughly half of whom came to power as widows or daughters of a male ruler.	一项研究表明，在20世纪独立国家的1 941名执政者中，只有27名女性，其中还有一半是以男性执政者的遗孀或女儿身份问鼎权力的。
Less than 1% of twentieth-century rulers were women who gained power on their own.	整个20世纪，只有不到1%的执政者是完全靠自己获得成功的。
So, given the new conventional wisdom in leadership studies that entering the information age means entering a woman’s world, why are women not doing better?	那么，既然领导力研究中的新传统智慧表明进入信息时代等于进入女性时代，那么为什么女性的表现没有起色呢？
Lack of experience, primary caregiver responsibilities, bargaining style, and plain old discrimination all help to explain the gender gap.	因为女性缺乏经验，其首要角色是看护者，其谈判风格尚不为人所接受，且旧歧视顽固不化，这些都能解释性别差异。
Traditional career paths, and the cultural norms that constructed and reinforced them, simply have not enabled women to gain the skills required for top leadership positions in many organizational contexts.	传统职业道路及其形成和加强的文化范式使得女性无法在组织环境中获得最高领导职位所必须的技能。
Research shows that even in democratic societies, women face a higher social risk than men when attempting to negotiate for career-related resources such as compensation.	研究表明，即使是在民主社会中，女性在进行与职业生涯资源有关的谈判（比如薪资谈判）时所面临的社会风险也要高于男性。
Women are generally not well integrated into male networks that dominate organizations, and gender stereotypes still hamper women who try to overcome such barriers.	女性总的来说无法很好地融入主导组织的男性网络，而顽固的性别观念仍然是女性克服这些障碍的绊脚石。
This bias is beginning to break down in information-based societies, but it is a mistake to identify the new type of leadership we need in an information age simply as “a woman’s world.”	这一歧视在基于信息的社会中正开始被打破，但把我们在信息时代所需要的新的领导风格简单地归为“女性世界”是不对的。
Even positive stereotypes are bad for women, men, and effective leadership.	即便是积极的顽固观念，对女性、男性和高效领导也是不利的。
Leaders should be viewed less in terms of heroic command than as encouraging participation throughout an organization, group, country, or network.	领袖应该更多地在组织、团队、国家或网络中承担鼓励参与的角色，更少地扮演英雄式的主宰者。
Questions of appropriate style – when to use hard and soft skills – are equally relevant for men and women, and should not be clouded by traditional gender stereotypes.	什么才是合适的风格 — — 什么时候硬，什么时候软 — — 对男性和女性同样重要，我们不应该被传统的性别顽固旧观念蒙蔽了双眼。
In some circumstances, men will need to act more “like women”; in others, women will need to be more “like men.”	在某些情形中，男性需要表现得“像个娘们 ” ， 而女性在某些情形中需要表现得“像个爷们 ” 。
The key choices about war and peace in our future will depend not on gender, but on how leaders combine hard- and soft-power skills to produce smart strategies.	我们的未来是战争还是和平，关键的选择并不取决于性别，而取决于领袖如何软硬兼施来构造巧妙的战略。
Both men and women will make those decisions.	不论是男性还是女性，都可以做出决策。
But Pinker is probably correct when he notes that the parts of the world that lag in the decline of violence are also the parts that lag in the empowerment of women.	但平克指出，从世界范围看，暴力消解不力的地区往往也是女性掌权情形落后的地区，或许，他是对的。
	
When Yes Means No	当“是”意味着“不”
Most commentators routinely assume that a Yes vote in the May 29 French referendum on the proposed European Union Constitution would be good for Europe and the EU.	大部分评论家都例行公事地以为，若5月29日法国公民投票结果赞成正在审议中的欧盟宪法，这将对欧洲和欧盟都有好处。
But there is reason to doubt the conventional wisdom.	但是，我们却有理由对这些想当然的观点表示质疑。
The French referendum will determine the political fate of French President Jacques Chirac – not France’s commitment to Europe, which is fixed and immutable.	法国公投将决定的不是法国对欧洲永恒不变的义务，而是法国总统雅克·希拉克的政治命运。
If the French vote No, M. Chirac is finished.	如果法国投了反对票，那么希拉克先生就完蛋了。
If they vote Yes, he is re-empowered.	如果他们投了赞成票，那么希拉克将东山再起。
Europe clearly would be better off with Chirac weakened than strengthened, even if it means a temporary slowing of the pace of integration.	显然，势力削弱的希拉克比势力强大的他对欧洲更为有利，即使这意味着欧洲整合的进程将暂时放缓脚步。
Chirac practices the politics of “scapegoatism” and excuses.	希拉克善于在政治上寻找“替罪羊”和运用借口托词。
According to Chirac, France’s exports are lagging not because France is losing its international competitiveness – although it is, especially to Germany – but because of the strong euro.	他辩称，法国出口下降并不是因为法国失去了它的国际竞争力 — — 尽管事实的确如此，尤其是法国对德国的出口 — — 而是因为走势强劲的欧元。
Likewise, France’s economic growth is waning not because France has failed to undertake necessary structural reforms, but because European interest rates are too high.	同样地，法国的经济增长衰退并不是因为法国没有能够采取必要的结构性改革，而是因为欧洲的利率太高了。
Who does Chirac think is at fault?	那希拉克认为究竟是谁的错呢？
The European Central Bank, of course, for allowing the euro to appreciate too much and for not cutting interest rates enough.	当然是欧洲中央银行，因为是它默许欧元升值过快，却没有降低利率。
Unfortunately, this is typical of Chirac’s leadership style: blame others, excuse yourself, and ignore reform.	不幸的是，这正是典型的希拉克领导风格：责怪他人，原谅自己，无视改革。
This is hardly the type of leadership Europe needs to survive and prosper in the modern world.	欧洲若要在现代世界中生存并繁荣，这可不是它需要的领导风格。
But Europe will get more of it if the French vote Yes.	但是如果法国投了赞成票，那么欧洲就更有的受了。
Europe also would continue to be dominated by the interests of the big countries, with the small countries in the back of the bus.	由于小国的胆小懦弱，欧洲还将继续受到大国利益的控制。
The fate of the Franco-German axis, in particular, hinges on the outcome of the referendum.	法-德轴心的命运尤其与此次公投的结果休戚相关。
A Yes invigorates the axis; a No weakens it.	法国的赞成票将加强该轴心，否决票则将削弱它。
“Who would follow Chirac if the French vote No?” asked one EU ambassador in a recent interview.	“若法国投否决票，谁会跟在它的后面呢 ？ ”
“Even Berlin has options.”	一位欧盟大使在最近一次采访中这样发问 ， “ 就连柏林也有自己的选择 。 ”
But Berlin would not like a No vote.	但是柏林并不希望看到一张否决票。
If Chirac goes down, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder loses face as well.	如果希拉克下台，德国总理格哈德·施罗德也会脸上无光。
Two birds would be wounded with one stone.	正所谓一石可伤二鸟。
The prospect of a re-energized Franco-German axis is why the Dutch – who are traditionally pro-European but do not want a Europe that marginalizes small countries – might vote No in their referendum (which follows shortly upon France’s) if the French vote Yes.	重新注入生机的法-德轴心的前景解释了为何一旦法国投出否决票，荷兰 — — 这个历史上一向亲欧、反对欧洲边缘化小国的国家 — — 可能会在它（紧随法国公投之后）的公民投票中投出反对票。
A Dutch No would signal rejection of a corporatist Europe dominated by French and German interests, as well as representing a protest against the unpopular conservative and moralistic policies of the Balkenende government.	荷兰的否决票是他们反对法国和德国利益控制下的合作主义欧洲的一个信号，也表达了他们对鲍肯内得（Balkenende）政府不得人心的保守说教政策的抗议。
France is not the only EU country with an unpopular leader.	法国并非欧洲唯一一个领导人不受拥戴的国家。
Eastern Europe also has a big stake in the outcome of the French referendum.	东欧和法国公投的结果也利害彼关。
Chirac made it perfectly clear how he feels about the new smaller countries when he told them to “shut up” when they disagreed with him over Iraq.	当那些小国对希拉克的伊拉克政策表示不同意见时候，希拉克通过让他们“闭嘴”明确地表示出了他对这些小国的态度。
More recently, Chirac’s foreign minister, Michel Barnier, chastised the Romanian President Traian Barescu for lacking a “European reflex,” because Barescu plans to align Romania with Anglo-Saxon liberal economic policies, and wants a special relationship with the US and UK to improve security in the Black Sea region.	就在前不久，法国外长米歇尔·巴尼耶（Michel Barnier）严厉谴责罗马尼亚总统特拉扬·伯塞斯库（Traian Barescu）缺乏“欧洲反应 ” ， 因为伯塞斯库准备在罗马尼亚实施盎格鲁-萨克逊自由经济政策，并欲与英国及美国建立特殊关系以加强黑海地区的安全。
Rather than buckle to France’s will, however, the Romanian president warned France’s leaders to stop lecturing his country – a sure sign that French influence is on the wane even in countries with which it has had close historical ties.	罗马尼亚总统没有顺从法国的意思，相反他警告法国领导人不要再对罗马尼亚指手画脚地说教 — — 这明确表明，即使在那些与它历史渊源深厚的国家，法国的影响力也在不断下降。
A French No would sit well with the Union’s newer members from Eastern Europe, who know Chirac is not their friend, and who are more attracted by promises of rapid economic growth than social protection and corporate state mischief.	法国的否决票将正合那些来自东欧的新欧盟成员国之意，他们知道希拉克并非善友，比起社会保障和合作主义国家这些招数，他们对快速经济增长更感兴趣。
Finally, the referendum contains an unstated question about the future of European Monetary Union (EMU) and the euro.	最后，公民投票包含了一个未说明的问题，即欧洲货币联盟(EMU)和欧元的未来。
The Yes camp argues that rejecting the Constitution would damage the European Central Bank (ECB) and the euro.	支持宪法的阵营坚称，反对欧盟宪法将会损害欧洲中央银行（ECB）和欧元。
But why would the EU fall into chaos and the euro wilt if the Treaty of Nice remains in force.	但是，如果尼斯条约仍然有效的话，为什么欧盟会陷入混乱，欧元会疲软呢？
In the area of monetary integration, the European Constitution doesn’t change anything, other than the voting procedures in the Governing Council if EMU grows beyond 15 member countries.	在货币整合时代，欧盟宪法除了在欧洲货币联盟的成员国超过15个的情况下改变管理委员会内的投票程序，并不能改变其他任何事情，
A Yes vote, on the other hand, would encourage a reassured Chirac to continue his policy of no reform and scapegoating the ECB.	从另外一方面来说，一张赞成票，将会鼓励一个重整旗鼓的希拉克继续他的无改革政策，继续把责任推卸给欧洲中央银行。
External political pressure on the ECB and its president, Jean-Claude Trichet, to lower interest rates and talk the euro down surely would increase.	施加于欧洲中央银行及其行长让·克洛德·特里谢（Jean-Claude Trichet）身上、要求降低利率并且降低欧元的外部政治压力肯定还会加强。
This is more likely to bring the euro down than a No vote.	比起一张否决票，这看起来也许更能有效降低欧元。
	
Where are the Global Problem Solvers?	全球问题的解决者到哪去了？
NEW YORK – One odd and disturbing aspect of global politics today is the confusion between negotiations and problem-solving.	发自纽约 — — 当今全球政治的一个奇怪和令人困扰之处是对谈判协商和解决问题的混淆。
According to a timetable agreed in December 2007, we have six months to reach a global agreement on climate change in Copenhagen.	在2007年12月份在哥本哈根制定的时间表，我们本还有6个月的时间在气候变化问题上达成全球一致的协议。
Governments are engaged in a massive negotiation, but they are not engaged in a massive effort at problem-solving.	然而各国政府却都把心思放在了大规模谈判而非不遗余力地解决问题之上。
Each country asks itself, “How do I do the least and get the other countries to do the most?,” when they should be asking instead, “How do we cooperate to achieve our shared goals at minimum cost and maximum benefit?”	每一个本应自问“该如何合作以最低成本和最大收益实来现共同目标”的国家，却反而在算计“该如何让自己承担最少而让其他国家做的更多 ？ ”
These might sound like the same thing, but they are not.	上述两个问题虽然都跟国家利益最大化有关，但却有着天渊之别。
Addressing the problem of climate change requires reducing emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels, which in turn involves choices in technology, some of which already exists and much of which needs to be developed.	事实上，解决气候变化问题需要减少燃烧化石燃料所排放的二氧化碳，但这反过来又涉及到相关技术的选择问题，虽然其中一些技术已经成熟，但还有一大部分仍有待发展。
For example, coal plants, if they are to remain a major part of the energy mix, will need to capture and store their CO2, a process called “carbon capture and sequestration,” or CCS for short. Yet this technology remains unproved.	举例来说，如果那些燃煤发电厂希望自己能继续作为能源供给结构的重要组成部分存在的话，那么就要应用捕获并储存二氧化碳的技术，这个技术过程被称为“碳捕捉和封存 ” （ 简称CCS ） ， 但却还未经研究证明有效。
Similarly, we will need renewed public confidence in a new generation of nuclear power, with plants that are safe and reliably monitored.	同样，我们需要公众对新一代的核电厂重新树立信心并安全可靠地监控其核反应堆的运作。
We will need new technologies to mobilize large-scale solar power, wind power, and geothermal power. We might try to tap bio-fuels, but only in forms that do not compete with food supplies or with precious environmental assets.	我们还需要发展能够大规模利用太阳能、风能和地热资源的新技术，甚至可以尝试开发生物燃料，只要不威胁到粮食供给和稀有环境资源就行了。
The list goes on.	
We will need improved energy efficiency, through “green buildings” and more efficient appliances. We will need to switch from cars with internal-combustion engines to hybrids, plug-in hybrids, battery-powered, and fuel-cell-powered vehicles.	此外世界各国还需要利用“绿色建筑”和节能家用电器来提高能源利用率，并引进以混合动力，充电式混合动力，充电电池以及燃料电池等新技术驱动的汽车来取代那些传统内燃机汽车。
Achieving a new generation of electric vehicles will require a decade of public and private partnership to achieve basic technological development (such as improved batteries), a more robust electric grid, new infrastructure for re-charging the automobiles, and much more.	但实现电动汽车的更新换代就要求公共和私人部门通力合作，耗费10年时间来发展基础技术（如电池改良 ） ， 架设更加强大的电网，建造为汽车充电的新基础设施以及更多其他方面的措施。
Similarly, it will take a decade of public and private investments to demonstrate the feasibility of coal-fired plants that capture their carbon dioxide.	同样，我们也将需要10年的公共和私人合作投资来进行燃煤发电厂捕捉二氧化碳技术的可行性研究。
The switchover to new technologies is not mainly a matter of negotiation but of engineering, planning, financing, and incentives.	而上述这些新技术的转换不仅涉及谈判协商，更涉及到工程，规划，融资和激励机制。
How can the world most effectively develop, demonstrate, and then spread these new technologies?	试问全世界如何才能最有效地开发，展示，然后推广这些新技术？
Where the benefits are unlikely to accrue to private investors, who should pay for the early demonstration models, which will require billions of dollars?	当投资收益吸引不了私人投资者时，谁又应该为建造早期示范工程的数十亿美元买单？
How should we preserve private incentives for research and development while committing to transfer successful technologies to developing countries?	如何既维护私人部门研究发展这些技术的积极性，又确保能将技术成功转让给发展中国家？
These are pressing, unsolved questions.	这些问题都非常紧迫而尚未解决。
Yet the global negotiations on climate change are focusing on a different set of questions.	然而应对全球气候变化问题的国际谈判却在关注一组截然不同的问题。
The negotiations are mainly about which groups of countries should cut their emissions, by how much, how fast, and relative to which baseline year.	谈判主要集中于哪些国家应该减排，减排多少，减排速度以及从哪一年开始。
Countries are being pressed to cut emissions by 2020 by certain percentage targets, without much serious discussion about how the cuts can be achieved.	以致许多国家在还没有认真讨论该如何减排的情况下就已经承受着在2020���达到特定指标的重压。
The answers depend, of course, on which low-emission technologies will be available, and on how fast they can be deployed.	而很显然能这些问题的答案其实要取决于使用哪些低排放技术以及什么时候投入使用。
Consider the United States. To cut emissions sharply, the US will need to switch over this decade to a new fleet of automobiles, powered increasingly by electricity.	以美国为例，要想迅速减少碳排放量，美国需要在十年内将所有汽车逐渐替换为新的电力驱动车型。
The US will also have to decide on the renewal and expansion of its nuclear power plants, and on the use of public lands to build new renewable energy plants, especially using solar power.	美国还要下决心改造并扩大其核电厂，并在公共用地上建造更多可再生能源发电厂，特别是太阳能发电厂。
And the US will need a new power grid to carry renewable energy from low-density population sites – such as the southwestern deserts for solar power and the northern plains for wind power – to the high-density populations of the coasts.	同时，美国还需要一个新电网将可再生能源从低人口密度地区 — — 比如太阳能资源丰富的西南部沙漠和风能充沛的北部平原 — — 传输到高人口密度的沿海地区。
Yet all of this requires a national plan, not simply a numerical target for emissions reduction.	然而，这一切的实现都需要全盘的国家计划，而不仅仅是一个减排的数字目标。
Similarly, China, like the US, can reduce CO2 emissions through increased energy efficiency and a new fleet of electric vehicles. But China must consider the question from the vantage point of a coal-dependent economy.	而中国跟美国一样，可以通过提高能源利用率和电动汽车来减少二氧化碳排放，但也要考虑到自身经济是煤依赖型经济这一具体情况。
China’s future choices depend on whether “clean coal” can really work effectively and on a large scale. Thus, China’s emissions path depends crucially on early testing of the CCS technologies.	因此中国的未来技术选择将取决于“清洁煤”技术是否有效应用并大规模推广，而整个国家的二氧化碳减排策略在很大程度上将取决于“碳捕捉和封存”技术的早期测试成果。
A true global brainstorming approach would first discuss the best technological and economic options available, and how to improve these options through targeted research and development and better economic incentives.	由此可见，一个真正全球集思广益的办法就是首先讨论可资利用的最佳技术和经济选项，以及如何通过有针对性的研发和更好的经济激励措施来改进这些选项。
The negotiations would discuss the range of options open to each country and region – from CCS to solar, wind, and nuclear power – and would sketch a timetable for a new generation of low-emission automobiles, recognizing that market competition as well as public financing will set the actual pace.	而谈判协商将讨论每一个国家和地区的技术选择范围 — — 从“清洁煤”到太阳能，风能，以及核能 — — 并拟定推广新一代低排放汽车的时间表，同时也认识到市场竞争和政府资助这两项因素将决定上述技术推广的真实进度。
Based on these building blocks, the world could agree on allocating the costs for speeding the development and spread of new low-emission technologies.	基于这些讨论模块，世界各国将讨论决定具体哪些国家将分担某种低排放技术的研发推广成本。
This global framework would underpin national and global targets for emissions control and for monitoring the progress of the technological overhaul.	而这一全球性框架将成为实现各国/全球减排目标以及监测技术革新进展的基础。
As new technologies are proven, the targets would become more stringent.	随着新技术的不断研究成功，那些减排目标也将变得更有说服力。
Of course, part of the strategy would be to create market incentives for new low-emission technologies, so that inventors could develop their own ideas with the prospect of large profits if those ideas are right.	当然，这个策略的其中一部分将是为低排放技术引入市场激励体制，以便让那些私人研究者在有利可图的情况下发展自己的新技术。
My plea to discuss plans and strategies alongside specific emissions targets might seem to risk impeding the negotiations. But if we don’t have a strategy to accompany our targets, the world’s governments might not accept such targets in the first place, or might accept them cynically, without any intention of actually meeting them.	虽然笔者提出要在具体减排目标之外制定计划和战略的请求似乎有阻碍谈判进行之嫌，但如果没有跟目标相配套的具体策略的话，各国政府首先都不会接受这一目标，即便接受了，或许也没打算真正去实现它。
We need to think hard, and collaboratively, about the world’s real technological options, and then pursue a common global framework that allows us to move into a new era, one based on feasible and sustainable technologies for energy, transport, industry, and buildings.	因此各国需要同心协力认真思考世界上真正可供选择的技术，然后以各种能源，运输，工业和建筑方面的可行和可持续技术为基础，最终构建一个能带领世界踏入新时代的全球性框架。
	
Where Are the Syrian Peacemakers?	叙利亚和平的缔造者尚在何处？
DENVER – Much has been said about the similarities between the chaos in Syria and the Balkan wars of the 1990’s.	发自丹佛 — — 人们对于叙利亚与巴尔干战争之间的相似性已经多有论述。
But, while the prolonged killing may indeed be reminiscent, the political and diplomatic effort that finally ended the war in Bosnia is hardly in evidence today.	但当旷日持久的杀戮确实令人回想起过去的惨剧时，当年在终结波斯尼亚战事方面所付出的政治和外交努力如今却不那么引人注目了。
To date, there has been nothing similar to the Contact Group plan that was hammered out in the summer of 1994 by representatives from Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and the United States, and implemented the following year in Dayton, Ohio, after months of on-the-scene diplomacy.	迄今为止，虽然在叙利亚进行了数月的现场外交行动，我们依然未能看到任何跟1994年由英国、法国、德国，俄罗斯和美国分别派代表发起，随后那年在美国俄亥俄州代顿市开始执行的联络小组计划（Contact Group plan）类似的东西。
In Syria, the only diplomatic process is in the hands of the courageous, if beleaguered, former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has understood – better than many analysts of this latest international outrage – that any lasting political settlement must not be a triumph of one side or the other.	目前该国唯一的外交进程由勇气可嘉 — — 同时也身陷重围的 — — 前联合国秘书长科菲·安南操持着，而他比许多关注这场最新国际暴行的分析者们更清楚的一点，就是任何有持续效力的政治和解都不会是一方压倒另一方的胜利。
No one can watch the ongoing violence in Syria without a sense of horror at the armed attacks on largely unarmed civilians, overwhelmingly by groups that support President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.	没人可以毫无恐惧感地坐视那些目前持续发生在叙利亚国内的，对手无寸铁平民的武装袭击 — — 且主要是由总统阿萨德的支持者发动的。
But those who say that Syria is on the brink of civil war miss what has become more obvious with each passing day: Syria alreadyis in a state of civil war, one whose battle lines were drawn months ago.	但那些认为叙利亚正处于内战边缘的人也忽视了一个每过一天都变得越发明显的事实：叙利亚已经处于内战状态，而且战线早在数月之前就已划定了。
On one side is Assad’s minority Alawite tribe, which over the years has attracted secular Sunnis to share in the spoils of a one-party, authoritarian state.	一方是总统阿萨德所属的少数伊斯兰什叶派阿拉维派部族，多年来他们一直与世俗逊尼派共同分享一个一党独裁国家所带来的甜头。
But Assad’s coalition is broader than that, which helps to explain how he has been able to hold on to power while other regimes in the region have not.	但阿萨德的联盟构成可比这更广泛，也足以解释他为什么能在本地区其他政权先后崩溃的情况下屹立不倒。
Syria’s Christians, many of its 1.5 million Kurds, and even Damascus-based, secular classes have been disinclined to join what is widely perceived in the country – though not by the rest of the world – as a sectarian Sunni opposition that might not be supportive of cultural pluralism were it to assume power.	叙利亚的基督教徒 — — 其中绝大部分是150万库尔德人 — — 甚至还有主要分布在首都大马士革的世俗阶层，都被迫加入一个可能在执政后不会支持文化多元主义的宗派主义逊尼派反对派 — — 这点在叙利亚国内司空见惯，但在国际上却鲜为人知。
In the past, characterizing as a civil war a conflict in a complex region was a tacit warning that others should stay out.	在过去，在一个复杂区域发生的具备内战特征的冲突其实就是某种沉默的警告：外人不要插手。
But the civil war in Syria has much broader ramifications, which could lead to a wider regional conflict.	但叙利亚的内战却有着更加严重的后果，并可能导致一场波及面更广的区域性冲突。
Given this looming threat, it is becoming increasingly clear that staying out of the Syrian mess may not be an acceptable choice for countries that have an interest in a calmer and more democratic Middle East.	考虑到这个不断增大的威胁，我们也应该逐渐明白袖手旁观对于那些对一个更平静也更民主的中东感兴趣的国家来说不是一个可接受的选项。
Ominously, the conflict looks increasingly like a proxy war between Iran and the Sunni Arab states, which regard their own minority Shia populations as a potential Iranian fifth column.	更不祥的是，这场冲突越来越像一场伊朗和逊尼派阿拉伯国家之间的代理人战争，而后者将本国的少数什叶派教徒视为伊朗的第五纵队。
Iran has sought to maintain its influence in the Levant (including in Lebanon and among some Palestinian groups) by providing material support to Assad.	伊朗试图通过对阿萨德提供物质支持的方式来保持自身对地中海东部地区（包括在黎巴嫩以及一些巴勒斯坦团体中）的影响力。
By contrast, many Sunni Arab states have provided varying degrees of support to the largely Sunni opposition, a hodgepodge of groups that include the Muslim Brotherhood and other sectarian forces similar to Egypt’s ultra-conservative Salafis.	相反，许多逊尼派阿拉伯国家则对主要由逊尼派组成的反对派提供不同程度的支持，而这股反对力量其实是一个包含了穆斯林兄弟会和其他宗派主义力量 — — 类似极端保守的埃及萨拉非党（Salafi ） — —的大杂烩。
Russia and China, bruised by their loss of face in the NATO-led intervention in Libya in 2011, have sought to keep the international community out of Syria.	而俄罗斯和中国则因为在2011年北约主导的利比亚干涉行动上丢了面子，于是希望把国际社会隔绝在叙利亚国门之外。
Both countries fear that intervention – whether militarily or through economic sanctions – could harm their interests in Syria, where they – especially the Russians – have been the dominant external players.	两国都害怕干涉行动 — — 不管是通过军事还是经济制裁的方式 — — 会损害他们在叙利亚的利益，而它们 — — 尤其是 — — 本来就是该国最主要的外部参与者。
In the absence of concerted international action, the US and Europe have largely weighed in with vocal condemnation of the party committing the overwhelming number of human-rights violations: Assad and his henchmen. They have also highlighted the loss of life in an effort to shame Russia into adopting a more amenable position.	在缺乏协同一致的国际行动的情况下，美国和欧洲在很大程度上都是通过对那些犯下大量人权暴行的组织 — — 阿萨德及其党羽 — — 进行口头谴责的方式来施加影响,同时还不断对人员伤亡情况进行渲染以迫使俄罗斯采取一个更负责任的立场。
But denouncing Assad or Russia is unlikely to produce any effect except to assure domestic audiences that the West is on the side of the angels in the conflict.	但除了能使当地听众确信西方是站在好人一方之外，谴责阿萨德或者俄罗斯起不到任何作用。
Likewise, proclaimed support for disparate, barely-known rebel groups; demands for dead-on-arrival sanctions resolutions; feckless calls for Assad’s departure (as if he plans to take the advice); and half-baked ideas about enforced “safe areas” (an utter failure in Bosnia) are unlikely to spare many lives, much less bring about the endgame that is so desperately needed.	同样，对那些杂七杂八鲜为人知的反抗团体表示支持；要求执行那些几乎毫无实施可能性的制裁方案；胡乱要求阿萨德离境（好像他愿意接受这个建议的样子 ） ； 以及那些不成熟的关于建立“安全区”的想法（在波斯尼亚就遭遇了彻底的失败 ） ， 都不足以拯救许多生命，也更无法带来人们迫切需要的冲突终结。
What is really needed are serious and sustained negotiations among interested international powers (let’s call them a “contact group”) on a viable political outcome.	真正需要的是关注此事的各国际力量之间进行认真且持续的谈判协商（让我们将其称之为���个“联络小组 ” ） 并因此产生一个切实可行的政治结论。
A “Contact Group Plan” should be carefully worked out with Annan and his team (the only entity at this point that seems to have access to all sides).	一个“联络小组计划”应该由安南及其团队（也是目前唯一能联络各方的实体）认真制定出来。
Most importantly, all of the plan’s stakeholders then need to support Annan, publicly and privately.	最重要的是，所有该计划的利益相关方都必须在计划出台后支持安南，不管是公开还是私下的。
Publicly declaring support for Annan’s ceasefire plan, and then whispering to journalists that it is “in tatters,” as has occurred repeatedly in recent weeks, will not get the job done.	一边公开宣称支持安南的停火计划，一边却私下告诉记者说该计划“彻底破产 ” ， 这种最近不断重演的做法是无法取得成果的。
Clearly, a new way forward is needed, and a good start would be a political/diplomatic plan that Annan could sell to the parties.	很显然，我们需要一个新的前进方式，而一个好的开始则是一个可以由安南向各方推销的政治/外交方案。
In the Balkans, it was a US team that finally sold the Contact Group Plan to the parties directly involved.	在巴尔干地区是一个美国团队最终向涉事各方推销了联络小组计划。
We didn’t succeed because we were geniuses. We succeeded because we had tremendous support from every country that wanted to see the horrific conflict in Bosnia brought to an end.	而我们成功推销的原因并不是因为自己是什么天才人物，是因为我们从所有希望看到波斯尼亚惨剧终结的国家处获得了极大的支持。
The same unqualified support is what Annan – the best diplomat we have out there – needs and deserves.	同样的无条件支持也是安南 — — 目前叙利亚地区最优秀的外交家 — — 所需要和应得的。
	
Where Did Market Volatility Go?	市场波动到哪里去了?
Television and newspapers continue to trumpet every twist and turn of global financial markets.	电视和报纸依然在鼓吹着全球金融市场的每一次波动。
In truth, however, the big story is the uneerie calm that has engulfed virtually every major asset class, from stocks to bonds.	然而，从大的层面上讲真正的情况却是令人不安的平静几乎已经席卷了从股票和债券所有大的资产品种。
Is the whole investment world on Prozac?	难道整个投资界都服了缓解焦虑的百忧解了吗？
Conspiracy theories abound, particularly among the ranks of financial traders, for whom volatility is like wind to a sailor.	合谋理论大量存在，尤其是在金融投资者的阶层中，对他们来说波动就像是水手眼里的风。
These traders confidently figure that as long as markets gyrate, no matter what the direction, they can always make money.	这些投资者声称只要市场在转动，不管它是转向哪个方向，他们总能够赚到钱。
And, thanks to the rest of us who don’t have the time, information, and skill to match wits with them, they are mostly right.	并且，我们其他的人并不拥有足够的时间、信息和技能去与他们斗智斗勇，所以他们总是对的。
But, with today’s dormant markets, the pickings are slim.	可是面对今天平静的市场，他们的利润就少得可怜了。
The favored bogeymen of the day are giant government investors, particularly Asian central banks, with their trillions of dollars in assets.	今天受益的精灵是巨大的政府投资者，尤其是拥有数以万亿计美元资产的亚洲中央银行。
These superfunds, whose managers do not necessarily share the same passion for profit as private investors, are said to be squeezing the life out of interest rates and exchange rates.	这些超级基金，它们的经理人并不需要像私人投资者那样一心一意地追求利润，被认为挤压了利率和汇率的活力。
“The big Asian central banks are oppressing us,” one young trader recently complained to me.	一位年轻的投资者最近向我抱怨说 ： “ 巨大的亚洲中央银行在压制着我们 。 ”
What a difference a decade makes.	仅仅十年间就发生了怎样巨大的变化啊。
During the 1990’s, private investors looked at big, lumbering central banks as cash cows, long on money and short on financial acumen.	在二十世纪九十年代，私人投资者把行动迟缓的中央银行看作现金金牛，它们有的是钱但是却缺乏敏锐的金融洞察力。
George Soros once made a billion dollars off the Bank of England in just an hour.	乔治·索罗斯曾在一个小时内从英格兰银行身上赚了十亿美元。
His basic strategy was a standard one: bet against any central bank that tries to defend an inconsistent macroeconomic policy.	他的基本策略很普通：攻击任何试图捍卫一个不连贯的宏观经济政策的中央银行。
Traders did not win every battle, of course.	当然，投资者并不是每一次都会赢。
It was the speculators whose blood flowed in the streets when they attacked Hong Kong’s dollar peg in 1998.	当他们1998年攻击香港的联系汇率时投机者们遭到了惨败。
But overall, betting against big government financial institutions proved to be a richly rewarding business.	但是总的来说，攻击巨大的政府金融机构被证明可以获得巨大的回报。
That was the 1990’s.	那是二十世纪九十年代的事情。
Today, many traders see formerly inept state giants as financial geniuses, capable of taming complex financial formulas and exploiting their superior size and trading information to squeeze the life out of currency and interest rate markets.	今天，许多投资者把他们以前心目中无能的政府庞然大物看作金融天才，它们可以驾驭复杂的金融公式并且利用它们的超大规模和贸易信息来挤压利率和汇率市场的活力。
These behemoths’ innate conservatism, having calmed bond and currency markets, is now having a similar effect on stocks.	这些庞然大物天生的保守思想使债券和汇率市场变得平静，并且现在对股票市场也正在发挥同样的作用。
Although few accuse Asian central banks of explicitly conspiring to calm global markets, some say that their common cautious approach to trading is a form of implicit collusion.	尽管很少有人指责亚洲中央银行有显而易见的合谋活动来平息全球市场，但是有些人说它们在贸易上共同的谨慎措施是一种隐含的合谋方式。
As much as we may sympathize with young would-be millionaire traders, does their story of oppression make any sense?	在我们对那些梦想成为百万富翁的年轻投资者表示同情的同时，他们所谓受到压制的说法真的如此吗？
Could it be true that huge government investors from Asia (not to mention Russia, Latin America, and the Middle East) have quietly taken control of world markets?	亚洲（更不用提俄罗斯、拉丁美洲和中东）巨大的政府投资者真的悄悄地控制了世界市场了吗？
Perhaps, but the bogeyman theory seems a bit overblown.	也许是的，但是所谓受益的精灵的说法有点夸大其词了。
Yes, the big Asian central banks do sit on almost $3 trillion in assets; China’s central bank alone has around a trillion dollars.	是的，巨大的亚洲中央银行确实坐拥将近3万亿美元的资产；中国的中央银行一家就拥有将近1万亿美元。
This gives them a capital base similar to the combined assets of all the world’s major hedge funds.	它们的资金相当于世界上所有大的对冲基金的资产总和。
But this metric is very deceptive.	但是这个衡量标准是极具欺骗性的。
Hedge funds constitute only a small percentage of overall world financial markets, which, according to a recent study by the McKinnsey Global Institute, now exceed $120 trillion.	对冲基金只在整个世界金融市场中占有很小的百分比。 而根据麦肯锡全球机构最近的一项研究显示，世界金融市场的总资产超过120万亿美元。
And hedge funds, unlike banks, can leverage their bets, borrowing to take on assets many times the size of their capital base.	而跟银行不同，对冲基金可以通过贷款来下注，借到数倍于它们资金规模的资金。
Otherwise, George Soros and his wealthy fellow investors could not have dreamed of taking on the Bank of England.	否则的话，乔治·索罗斯和他富有的投资者伙伴也不会梦想去挑战英格兰银行。
In fact, the explanation for market calm probably lies elsewhere.	事实上，市场平静的原因也许出在其他方面。
So, if a conspiracy of Asian central banks is not to blame for the volatility drought that is parching traders’ earnings, what is?	如果亚洲中央银行没有合谋造成市场波动的严重不足从而使投资者无从收益，那么原因在哪儿呢？
Surely, today’s low volatility is partly cyclical.	当然，今天的低波动���分是周期性的。
Stock market volatility was also very low during the early 1990’s, before reaching new peaks later in the decade.	在二十世纪九十年代早期股票市场在该年代后期达到新的顶点前其波动也非常小。
Moreover, financial innovation and globalization allow markets to spread risk more effectively than ever before, placing it in the hands of those who can best manage it.	另外，金融革新和全球化使市场比以前能更有效地传播风险，而把它放在那些能最好地控制它的人手中。
Improved central bank policy is another huge factor.	中央银行政策的改进也是另外一个巨大的因素。
In the early 1990’s, the average level of world inflation exceeded 30%; now it is less than 4%.	在二十世纪九十年代早期，世界通货膨胀的平均水平超过30 % ； 而现在它只有不到4 % 。
All of these changes have in turn contributed to lower economy-wide output and consumption volatility in both rich and developing countries.	所有这些变化反过来使富有国家和发展中的国家经济方面的产量和消费波动都降低了。
They have also contributed mightily to the high general level of asset prices, helping create the vast riches of which today’s hungry young traders are so jealous.	它们还大大地帮助使资产价值总体上处于一个很高的水准，并且创造了令当今的饥渴的年轻投资者们如此羡慕的巨大的财富。
So will today’s relative market calm continue?	那么今天市场相对的平静会一直延续下去吗？
Unfortunately, no.	不幸的是，答案是否定的。
Today’s brave new world of financial globalization will almost surely face severe new stress tests, reminding us that recessions still happen.	今天金融全球化美妙的新世界几乎肯定会面临严峻的新的压力的挑战，提醒我们衰退依然在发生着。
Frankly, although I do not see the five-year-old global expansion coming to an end yet, there is no question that risks are on the rise, with output in the United States having slowed sharply in the third quarter, and central banks’ hands tied by inflation risks. Further ahead, it is not hard to imagine geopolitical instability – possibly emanating from Iran, Iraq, or North Korea – unsettling markets.	坦率地说，尽管我并不认为长达五年的全球增长已经走到了尽头，但是毫无疑问风险正在加大，美国第三季度的产量就大大放缓了，而中央银行正在极力消除通货膨胀的危险。
Whatever the scenario that ends the calm, today’s age of low volatility will seem like a distant dream to most of us – and a forgotten nightmare for ambitious financial traders.	不管用什么方案来结束现在市场的平静，今天的低波动对于我们大多数人来说将会成为一个遥远的梦 — — 并且成为雄心勃勃的金融交易者们的一个遗忘的恶梦。
	
Which New Middle East?	什么样的新中东？
BERLIN – Regardless of whether democratization in the “new Middle East” succeeds or authoritarian forms of government prevail once again, one fundamental change has already become clear: no one will be able to govern without taking into account domestic public opinion.	发自柏林 — — 不管“新中东”的民主化能否成功或是独裁政府卷入土重来，一个根本性的变化已经明白无误地发生了：再没有人能在无视本国民意的情况下推行自身统治。
This change will shift the foreign-policy parameters of the Middle East conflict (understood as both an Israeli-Palestinian conflict and as a conflict between Israelis and Arabs more generally).	这一变化将改变应对中东地区冲突 — — 以巴之间，或者宏观上的以色列人和阿拉伯人之间 — — 的外交政策考虑因素。
Despite wars in Lebanon and Gaza, and the intifadas in the occupied West Bank, these parameters have proven surprisingly stable for decades, anchored by the peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan and the Oslo accords with the Palestinians.	在以色列与埃及和约旦两国签署的和平协议，以及与巴勒斯坦人签订的《奥斯陆协议》的基础上，不管经历了黎巴嫩和加沙地区的战争还是西岸占领区的巴勒斯坦人起义，数十年里来这些因素都出人意料地保持了稳定
All this is about to change.	但这一切都将被改变。
And, while the tectonic shift in the region was triggered by the “Arab Awakening,” its players are not limited to the Arab world or to the confines of the Middle East conflict.	虽然该地区的政治架构变动是由所谓的“阿拉伯觉醒”所触发的，但其参与者并不仅限于阿拉伯世界或是中东冲突的范围。
The United States, Europe, Turkey, and, in a certain sense, Iran all play a role – some more directly than others.	美国、欧洲，土耳其以及（在某种情况下）伊朗都粉墨登场 — — 只是干涉的程度有不同而已。
Let’s begin with the US.	让我们先看看美国。
President Barack Obama’s speech in Cairo two years ago created great expectations, but few or none have been fulfilled.	奥巴马总统两年前发表的开罗讲话构思了一个宏大的远景，但事实上却毫无建树（或仅仅实现了极少部分 ） 。
Instead, the US allowed a political vacuum to form in the absence of any movement on the part of Israel’s government. This vacuum has now been filled by the Arab Awakening.	相反，美国容许在以色列政府缺乏任何行动的情况下出现一个政治真空，而如今这个真空就被“阿拉伯觉醒”所填补了。
Europe, meanwhile, is preoccupied with its own crisis.	与此同时，欧洲正深陷于内部危机当中。
But, in the last few years, the Europeans, led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, have de facto slammed the door to European Union accession in Turkey’s face.	但在过去几年中，由德国总理默克尔和法国总统萨科齐带领下的欧洲人事实上当着土耳其人的面关上了加入欧盟的大门。
As a result, Turkey has embraced a “neo-Ottoman” foreign policy, in which the Arab world – even more than the Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Balkans – plays the central role.	于是土耳其转而采取了一项“准土耳其帝国”外交政策，把重心放在了阿拉伯世界 — — 甚至包括高加索，中亚和巴尔干地区。
Of course, Turkey, in accordance with its political, security, and economic interests, has no choice but to pay close attention to its southern neighborhood, and must try to prevent chaotic developments there.	当然基于其政治，安全和经济利益，土耳其都必须密切关注其南面各邻邦并尝试阻止那些地区陷入任何形式的混乱当中。
Turkey would be facing the same risks even if it were integrated into a European context, but its priorities would then be completely different.	虽然应对的重点会完全不同，但即使是纳入了欧洲架构中的土耳其都将面对同样的风险。
Because of Europe’s short-sightedness, Turkey has in effect abandoned its ambitions for EU membership and opted for the neo-Ottoman project of becoming a Middle Eastern power – a policy shift that reflects both interests and ideology.	由于欧洲的短视，土耳其实际上放弃了自己的入盟梦想并转而走上了一条寻求成为中东重要势力的准土耳其帝国之路 — — 而这也是一条反映出其利益和意识形态的政策。
On the one hand, Turkey views regional dominance as a stepping-stone to a greater global role; on the other hand, it views itself as a role model for successful modernization of the Middle East on an Islamic-democratic basis.	一方面，土耳其将区域称霸视为晋身全球势力的垫脚石；另一方面，该国也将自身视为中东地区成功实现伊斯兰民主现代化的楷模。
This bid for regional preeminence will sooner or later bring Turkey into serious conflict with neighboring Iran.	这种争当区域老大的做法迟早将使土耳其和伊朗两国爆发严重冲突。
If Turkey prevails, Iran and the radicals in the region will be caught on the losing side of history – and they know it.	如果土方得胜，伊朗以及区域内的极端势力将遭遇历史性的惨败 — — 而后者也深知这一点。
While Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s government is trying to maintain good relations with Iran, its ambition to become the leading Sunni power means that Turkey must sooner or later contest Iran’s influence in Iraq, as well as in Syria and Palestine. And that means conflict.	而当土耳其总理埃尔多安的政府试图与伊朗维持友好关系之时，前者成为逊尼派穆斯林国家领头羊的野心意味着土耳其迟早会在伊拉克，叙利亚和巴勒斯坦挑战伊朗的影响力 — — 这当然也意味着冲突。
The drastic deterioration in Turkey’s relations with Israel is related to this emerging Iranian-Turkish rivalry.	此外土耳其与以色列关系的迅速降温也与伊朗-土耳其敌对状态的出现有关。
To be sure, this rivalry also has a positive side from the Israeli point of view – the weakening of Iran and other regional radicals.	可以确定的是，这种敌对状态对以色列来说是有利的 — — 伊朗和极端分子将遭到削弱。
But, for Turkey as an aspiring regional leader, the interests of the Palestinians are naturally more important than its relations with Israel.	但对土耳其这个野心勃勃的区域领袖来说，巴勒斯坦所代表的利益自然要比以色列要大。
This has become all the more true in light of the revolutionary changes in the Arab world, and is at the root of Erdoğan’s foreign-policy reorientation.	而根据目前阿拉伯世界所发生的革命性变化来看这个判断显然更加正确，也是埃尔多安外交政策转向的根源。
As a result, Israel is in an increasingly difficult situation.	结果以色列就陷入了一个日渐艰难的境地。
Without a strategic re-orientation of its own – to remain passive is a risky endeavor in a rapidly changing world order – Israel would further delegitimize and isolate itself internationally.	由于其本身并未实施任何战略转向 — — 在一个急速变化的世界秩序中持有消极态度实在是个危险之举 — — 以色列将进一步失去其存在合法性并在国际上孤立自己。
A viable Israeli answer to the dramatic changes in the region – and to their already foreseeable consequences – can only take the form of a serious offer of negotiations to Mahmoud Abbas’s Palestinian government, with the objective of signing a comprehensive peace treaty.	��以色列针对该区域激烈变革 — — 以及他们已经预料到的后果 — — 的积极回应只能是与阿巴斯领导下的巴勒斯坦权力机构展开认真谈判，并以此签署一个全面的和平条约。
Security questions must be taken seriously, but they carry less and less weight, because a sufficiently long period can be left between the treaty’s conclusion and its full implementation to resolve them by mutual agreement.	虽然安全问题必须认真考虑，但由于双方在上述和平条约的签署和全面实施之间会有足够时间对此进行协商，它们所占的分量已经日渐减轻了。
But Israel’s current passivity – with all of its negative long-term consequences for the country – is likely to continue as long as Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu considers his coalition’s survival more important than a decisive peace initiative.	但只要总理内塔尼亚胡继续认为自己执政联盟的生存比一个决定性和平方案更重要的话，以色列目前的消极 — — 以及所有将对这个国家造成的长期后果 — — 都将依然存在下去。
At the same time, the pressure of the Arab revolutions is transforming the Palestinians into a dynamic political factor.	与此同时，阿拉伯革命的压力将把巴勒斯坦转变成为一个活性政治因素。
For example, in view of the looming fall of Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad, the pressure of the Egyptian revolution, and the new role of Islamism in the region, Hamas’s alliance with Iran is becoming increasingly problematic.	比如说鉴于叙利亚总统阿萨德下台，埃及革命的压力以及伊斯兰教在该区域所扮演的新角色，哈马斯与伊朗的结盟正变得越来越充满变数。
It remains to be seen whether, in the end, the “Turkish course” will prevail against the radicals in Gaza or not.	我们也可以拭目以待，看“土耳其进程”是否将在最后压倒加沙地区的极端势力。
In any case, Hamas faces some risky and consequential decisions of its own – all the more so should its main rival, Abbas’s Palestinian Authority, succeed in its current diplomatic campaign at the United Nations.	而无论在何种情况下哈马斯都将面对一系列将给自身带来风险和负面结果的决定 — — 如果阿巴斯领导下的巴勒斯坦民族权力机构最近在联合国展开的外交行动取得成功的话，情况就将更加严重。
Obama had promised a Palestinian state within one year, and Abbas is now building upon that promise.	奥巴马已经承诺在一年之内实现巴勒斯坦建国，而阿巴斯则在进一步落实这一承诺。
But what happens next is crucial.	但下一步将发生的事则极端重要。
Will Abbas be able to keep the Palestinians on a diplomatic path, or will the situation degenerate again into violence and another disaster?	阿巴斯是否能巴勒斯坦人团结在一条外交道路上，或者再次堕落为暴力和另一场灾难。
And what will the Palestinian road towards peace look like after the UN decision to recognize some form of statehood for Palestine?	而当联合国认可了某种形式的建国之后巴勒斯坦的和平之路又将是何种走向？
Given the current pace of change in the Middle East, we might not have to wait long for answers – or for more questions.	依照中东地区目前的变革轨迹，我们可能不需要等待太久就能看到答案 — — 或者是更多的麻烦。
	
Which Turkey in What Europe?	何种土耳其加入何种欧洲？
“A tempest in a teapot” is perhaps the best description of the recent squabbles about opening the European Union’s accession negotiations with Turkey.	最近欧盟开启与土耳其的入盟谈判所引起的争论可谓小题大做。
The election in Germany was in part fought on the issue, as Chancellor Angela Merkel ran on a platform of offering Turkey a “privileged partnership,” rather than full admission.	德国大选有一部分也是有关这一问题，德国总理安格拉·默克尔的竞选纲领为土耳其提供一个“特殊伙伴关系 ” ， 而非完整成员资格。
The Austrian government’s posturing – motivated as much by its upcoming elections as genuine foreign policy concerns – seemed to threaten the opening of the accession talks themselves.	奥地利政府受即将到来的选举和切实的外交担忧的双重推动而做出的姿态似乎威胁到开启入盟谈判。
But German foreign policy has always been marked by continuity, and the new foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the chief of staff under former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, has repeatedly advocated full membership for Turkey.	但是，德国的外交政策素来以连续性著称，前总理施罗德办公厅主任、新任外长弗兰克·沃尔特·施泰因迈尔多次重申土耳其应当具有完整的成员资格。
It is thus unlikely that the Grand Coalition will adopt a different political approach towards Turkey than the previous Red-Green government.	因此，德国的大联合政府不大可能在对待土耳其的问题上采取与前红绿政府不同的政治策略。
After a bit of drama, Austria also gave up its opposition to the accession talks, in exchange for a promise of admission for Croatia, and the intra-European squabbles have been patched up.	一阵激变之后，奥地利也不再反对入盟谈判。 作为交换，它得到了克罗地亚入盟的保证。
	这场欧洲内部的争论终于终结。
So the British, under Tony Blair’s current presidency of the EU Council of Ministers, have gotten their way for now, and the Americans – keen backers of Turkey’s EU aspirations – have once again succeeded in acting as a “European power.”	于是，英国作为欧盟轮值主席国暂时如愿以偿。 美国积极支持土耳其入盟的愿望，也再一次成功地扮演了“欧洲列强”的角色。
Accession negotiations with Turkey are now a fact.	土耳其的入盟谈判现在成为了既成事实。
But much of the debate about Turkey’s possible accession has been focused on the wrong issues: whether Turkey is culturally “in line” with Europe or whether Europe is in some sense “Christian” and could assimilate 100 million Muslims.	但是，有关土耳其的可能的入盟争论却集中于错误的问题上。 也就是，土耳其在文化上是否与欧洲“一致 ” ， 或者，欧洲在某种含义上是否归属“基督教 ” 、 能否吸纳一亿穆斯林。
The real issue – not disputed even by most Turks – is that Turkey is neither economically ready nor, above all, a mature enough democracy for full EU membership.	真正的问题是，土耳其既非在经济上准备就绪，而且最为重要的是，并不是一个符合欧盟成员资格的完全民主国家。 这一问题连大多数土耳其人都不质疑。
and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s prime minister, can place his trust in the near automatic mechanisms that characterize the EU’s instDespite substantial progress, democratization is only a torso.	尽管土耳其取得了实质性进步，但是民主化仍然残缺不全。
Human and civil rights still do not meet Western European standards, religious and ethnic minorities are recognized only on paper, acknowledgment of the historic genocide of the Armenians is given mere lip service, and civilian control over the military remains weak.	人权以及民权仍然无法满足西欧标准，宗教和少数族裔只是在纸面上得到承认，承认史上对亚美尼亚人的种族屠杀还仅仅是口惠而实不至，而军队的平民控制依然微弱。
Raising this long list of shortcomings puts Western critics in an uncomfortable position with their pro-European Turkish interlocutors.	列举这一长长的不足清单足以把西方批评家同他们的亲欧洲的土耳其对话者处于一个不利的地位。
Turkey’s pro-Western forces find just as much fault with their country’s political system as the European critics, but they expect the prospect of EU membership to accelerate the progress of reforms.	土耳其的亲西方势力所看到的他们国家政治体制中的毛病和欧洲批评家所看到的一样多，但是，他们期望欧盟成员的前景可以加快改革进程。
Nationalist Turks, on the other hand, regard joining the EU mainly as a confirmation of national power and view all criticism of the country as a violation of Turks’ collective honor.	另一方面，土耳其的民族主义者主要把加入欧盟视为对其国力的确认，而且将对其国家的所有批评都看作是对土耳其人集体荣誉的破坏。
Had the start of accession negotiations been postponed or canceled, Turkey’s pro-Europeans would have suffered from a nationalist backlash.	如果入盟谈判推迟或取消，那么，土耳其的亲欧洲人士将受到民族主义者回击。
Even now, Turkey’s unrequited love for Europe can still fade into aversion, with Islamic fundamentalism and Greater Turkey nationalism continuing to represent other, eastward-leaning options.	即使是现在，土耳其对欧洲的一厢情愿仍旧可能转变为厌恶，到时，伊斯兰原教旨主义和大土耳其民族主义将继续代表其他向东方倾斜的选择。
Advocates of a conditioned accession are thus under extraordinary pressure to be nice, even as Turkish officials stage provocations, like the recent suit against the noted author Orhan Pamuk for “public denigration of Turkish identity” because he dared to question the official position on the Armenian genocide.	有条件入盟的支持者因此面临巨大的压力要做到无懈可击，即使是土耳其官员挑起事端也是如此。 著名作家奥冉·巴穆最近因“公开诋毁土耳其特色”而遭到起诉，因为他敢于质疑官方有关亚美尼亚种族屠杀的立场。
As a result, a general lack of clarity about what kind of Turkey should be accepted characterizes the accession debate, which focuses – much as in the recent referenda on the EU constitution in France and the Netherlands – on rather meaningless generalities.	所以，对于究竟应当接受哪种土耳其的问题莫衷一是成为入盟争论的特征。 这一争论就像最近法国和荷兰的欧盟宪法全民公投一样集中于没有意义的一般原则。
But, more importantly, the lack of clarity on the Turkish accession question reflects Europe’s ambivalence regarding its image of itself.	但是，更为重要的是，在土耳其入盟问题上莫衷一是反映了欧洲在其本身形象上的矛盾态度。
To be sure, Turkey shows substantial political and cultural differences, especially when it comes to the importance of civil society, sexual equality, and the role of religion in public life.	的确，土耳其展现了实质上的政治和文化区别，特别是在公众社会的重要性、性别平等以及公共生活中宗教的作用等等问题上。
But the real question is this: what kind of Europe do Europeans themselves want?	然而，实际问题是：欧洲人自己想要一个什么样子的欧洲？
“Deepening” and “widening” European integration are the superficial opposites here.	在此 ， “ 加深”和“扩大”欧洲联合只是表面对立。
Austria does not want any more members – with the inconsistent exception of Croatia – but wants to deepen the EU’s political and cultural unity.	除了克罗地亚这一并不连贯的例外之外，奥地利不想要任何更多的成员，但是想要加深欧盟的政治和文化团结。
Many “old” Europeans, including Germany after Schröder’s resignation and France under a weakened Jacques Chirac, share that stance.	许多“老”欧洲人，包括施罗德辞职后的德国和雅克·希拉克权力削弱后的法国，都持有那一立场。
Britain, the leading nation of “new” Europe, has no desire for an EU constitution, more executive and parliamentary power in Brussels, a stronger European Parliament, or the euro.	作为“新”欧洲的主要国家，英国无意通过欧盟宪法，增强布鲁塞尔的行政和议会权力和欧洲议会或者实行欧元。
Like many new members, Britain prefers a loosely connected Europe of different nations – essentially a free-trade zone, but with open borders at its periphery – with sufficient strategic coordination to constitute a quasi-empire in geopolitical terms, on a par with the United States.	像许多新成员一样，英国更喜欢一个由不同国家组成的、松散联合的欧洲，也就是基本上是一个自由贸易区，外围开放边界，战略协调充分，以便同美国平起平坐，成为一个地缘政治意义上的准帝国。
The fundamental difference is that a loosely tied Union is attractive to all sorts of aspirants, including Georgia, Ukraine, and other Soviet successor states – and perhaps even North African countries like Morocco – while a “deepened” Europe, with a clear political identity, high social-welfare entitlements, and growing cultural homogeneity, would naturally set itself apart and not be particularly attractive to these countries.	根本区别是，一个松散的联盟对各类有意入盟的国家而言都有吸引力，包括格鲁吉亚、乌克兰以及其他苏联继承国，甚至像摩洛哥那样的北非国家；而“深化的”欧洲，由于明显的政治特征、高昂的社会福利以及不断增长的文化同性，自然会与众不同，对于这些国家而言并无特别吸引力。
Paradoxically, then, what the British, with their opposition to “deepening” European integration, are really offering the Turks is precisely the sort of “privileged partnership” that Austria, together with Angela Merkel, has been backing.	因此，自相矛盾的是，英国尽管反对“深化”欧洲联合，恰恰给土耳其提供奥地利以及安格拉·默克尔所支持的“特殊伙伴关系 ” 。
Both positions reject the idea of making Turkey really “European.”	两种立场都拒绝将土耳其完全“欧洲化”的主张。
The structure that Britain seems to have in mind is, according to some, reminiscent of the loose alliance binding the British Commonwealth.	据某些人的看法，英国看起来所设想的结构令人联想起联合英联邦的松散联盟。
But “History’s ruse” could be that even as the British succeed in improving Turkey’s prospects for admission, the renegotiation of the Nice treaty, which will become necessary if Croatia is admitted, is likely to lead to stronger European integration.	然而 ， “ 历史诡计”可能是，即使英国成功地改善土耳其入盟的前景，但是，一旦接纳克罗地亚就必须对尼斯条约重新谈判，这样就有可能导致更为强大的欧洲联合。
Thus, what we may get is both deepening and widening of the EU – something that today seems like squaring the circle.	这样，我们可能既深化欧盟又扩大欧盟。 这样的结果今天看起来好似水中捞月。
	
Which Way is West for Turkey?	哪里才是土耳其的西方？
When Turkey's parliament voted in March 2003 against allowing American troops to open a northern front against Iraq, Turkey's traditional strategic partnership with the United States ended.	随着2003年3月土耳其议会对美国军队开辟伊战北线的计划投下反对票，土耳其与美国之间传统的战略伙伴关系终于走到了尽头。
The two countries still recognize many mutual interests, but now they manage these interests on a far different basis.	尽管土美之间还有不少共同利益，可如今他们管理这些利益的基础却已经大不相同了。
The vote shocked "old Europe" and the Arab world as much as the Bush administration.	投票结果震惊了"老欧洲"和阿拉伯世界，也震惊了布什政府。
Europeans who considered Turkey a potential Trojan horse for America within the European Union were forced to reconsider.	这个结果让那些曾把土耳其当成美国可能安插到欧盟内部的一匹特洛伊木马的欧洲人也不得不对土耳其刮目相看。
For many Arabs, the vote showed that Turkey was not an American lackey and would not cooperate with American imperial designs, despite close Turkish-Israeli relations.	而对阿拉伯人来讲，这一结果表明尽管土以关系十分密切，但土耳其毕竟不是美国的马屁精，也不会配合美国的霸权企图。
Long-simmering disagreements between Turkey and the US came to a boil with the emergence of the Kurds of northern Iraq as the Pentagon's main allies in the Iraq War.	随着居住在伊拉克北部的库尔德人成为五角大楼对伊战争的主要盟友，潜藏已久的土美分歧终于爆发了。
The American administration made it clear that military intervention by Turkey in Northern Iraq would not be tolerated.	美国政府明确表示：美国绝不容许土耳其对伊北部实行军事干预。
That message was confirmed on July 4, 2003, when American forces arrested several Turkish Special Forces troops in the town of Sulaimaniya, humiliating them by putting sacks over their head as they took them into custody.	2003年7月4日，美军在苏莱曼尼亚逮捕了几名土耳其特种部队成员，并在押送过程中把布袋套在他们头上以示羞辱，这再次表明了美国不许土耳其军事干预的强硬态度。
Only intervention by US Vice President Dick Cheney two and a half days later secured the release of the soldiers, who were alleged to have been planning clandestine operations within the Kurdish zone.	两天半后，只是因为美国副总统迪克·切尼出面干预，这几名土耳其士兵才得以获释。 他们的罪名是：企图在库尔德地区策划秘密行动。
Despite ongoing tensions, the Turkish government has been eager to mend relations with America, as it is anxious to have some influence over developments in Iraq.	尽管近来摩擦不断，土耳其政府还是尽量想和美国修复关系，因为它非常希望能对伊拉克的事态发展施加影响。
So the authorities responded quickly to the Bush administration's request for Turkish troops to join the coalition, although the idea was stillborn - rejected by both the Kurds and the American-appointed Governing Council in Iraq.	因此，土耳其政府对布什政府发出的加入联军的邀请做出了快速的响应，尽管这次行动从一开始就注定不可能成功－库尔德人和美国任命的伊拉克管理委员会都明确表示反对。
America has its own reasons to patch up the relationship.	美国也同样有着修复关系的愿望。
Turkey's secular, capitalistic, democratic order has become especially valuable to the Bush administration as it seeks to integrate the wider Middle East into the world system by liberalizing its economy and democratizing its polity.	在布什政府试图把中东广大地区纳入其全球体系，在那里实现经济自由化和政治民主化的过程中，土耳其的世俗、资本和民主秩序在美国政府看来都显得弥足珍贵。
Thus, America trumpeted its continuing support for Turkish membership in the EU, notably in President Bush's speech in June at Istanbul's Galatasaray University - at a bridge that joins Asia and Europe.	于是，布什总统6月在伊斯坦布尔加拉塔萨雷大学的讲话中再次重申了支持土耳其加入欧盟的立场，布什这次讲话的地点被安排在一座连接亚欧大陆的桥上。
But serious bilateral problems remain.	但土美双边关系还是存在着严重问题。
The government is irritated by US occupation forces' neglect of the northern Iraqi bases of the PKK, the Kurdish separatist insurgents who have fought a 15-year war against Turkey.	代表库尔德分离主义势力的库尔德工人党已经和土耳其交战了15年，而美国占领军却对其在伊北部的大本营视而不见。
More broadly, the government regards the US as too complacent vis-à-vis Kurdish political developments and unmoved by Turkey's concerns about Kurdish independence.	从更广义的角度讲，土耳其政府认为美国在对待库尔德局势发展的问题上太自以为是，根本不顾及土耳其在库尔德独立问题上的重重顾虑。
The US, for its part, is unhappy with the government's objections to unrestricted American use of the Incirlik airbase in southeastern Turkey, as well as by recent tensions with Israel.	而美国方面也对土政府拒绝其无限制使用土北部因斯里克空军基地的决定感到十分不快，此外引起美国不满的还有近来土以之间的紧张关系。
In the meantime, Turkey is moving closer to the EU, with the government overcoming nationalistic objections in the Parliament to push through comprehensive reforms.	与此同时，土耳其与欧盟的关系正日益密切，政府战胜了议会中的民族主义势力，开始推行全面的改革。
Turkey also showed its good will over Cyprus, removing a nagging political obstacle to EU membership.	此外，土政府在塞浦路斯问题上也表达了诚意，去掉了加入欧盟过程中一个令人心烦的政治障碍。
These steps led to the European Commission's recent recommendation to begin accession negotiations with Turkey.	上述举措使欧盟委员会在不久前发出倡议，建议开始与土耳其进行入盟谈判。
The EU accession process has also underpinned a shift in Turkish policy on Iraq.	欧盟的入盟进程也改变了土耳其的对伊政策。
Previously, Turkey viewed Iraq solely in the context of its domestic Kurdish problem.	从前，土耳其是单纯从国内库尔德问题出发来看待伊拉克的。
But widespread European opposition to the war removed the possibility of Turkish military intervention, forcing the government to develop another vision of Turkey's interests.	但欧洲国家的普遍反对消除了土耳其军事干预的任何可能性，迫使政府从另外的角度去看待土耳其的利益。
At the same time, the Iraqi Kurds also appear to appreciate how much they need a friendly Turkey.	与此同时，伊拉克库尔德人似乎也极为看重一个态度友好的土耳其。
The northern border with Turkey is their lifeline to the outside world.	与土耳其的北部边界是他们与外界沟通的生命线。
As a result, Turkey no longer considers a federalized Iraq a threat to its security, as long as each federal unit maintains a measure of ethnic diversity.	其结果是只要伊拉克联盟停留在保持种族多样性的范围之内，土耳其就不再把伊拉克联盟看成是对本国安全的威胁。
Of course, Turkey remains opposed to an independent Kurdistan. But now its concern is more closely tied to regional politics than to the Kurdish issue.	当然，土耳其仍然反对库尔德斯坦独立，但现在它所担心的问题更多地集中在地区政治，而不是库尔德问题的领域。
Turkey has no desire to serve as a strategic counterweight to Iran and believes that only a territorially intact Iraq can continue to play that role.	土耳其并不希望成为平衡伊朗的战略砝码，而且它认为，只有领土完整的伊拉克才能继续担此重任。
Furthermore, Turkey is concerned about the possibility of civil war in Kurdistan between the two largest Kurdish factions.	不仅如此，库尔德斯坦两大集团间爆发内战的可能性令土耳其政府倍感忧虑。
But, unlike either Iran or Syria, Turkey genuinely wishes to see a strong and representative government in Baghdad.	但与伊朗和叙利亚不同，土耳其是真心希望看到巴格达建立起有代表性的强大政府。
Thanks to EU pressures, Turkey's domestic Kurdish problem is well on the way to being resolved democratically, with most Kurdish leaders in Turkey expressing their commitment to Turkish unity.	多亏来自欧盟的压力，土耳其国内的库尔德问题正在走入民主解决的轨道，土耳其国内的绝大多数库尔德领袖都表达了他们支持土耳其统一的立场。
For Turkey to consider military intervention in Kurdistan, EU member states would first have to renege on their commitment to negotiate Turkish accession.	如果要让土耳其重新考虑对库尔德斯坦的军事介入，首先要欧盟成员国撕毁他们开始土耳其入盟谈判的承诺。
Equally dramatic would be any attempt by the Kurds to forcibly change the demographic balance of the multiethnic city of Kirkuk.	此外，库尔德人采取任何措施，强行改变多种族城市基尔库克的人口构成，其可能性也将同样微乎其微。
Turkey would prefer that Kirkuk, with its large Turkmen population, be given special status in the forthcoming draft Iraqi constitution.	土耳其希望有着众多土库曼人口的基尔库��，能在即将出台的伊拉克宪法草案中获得特殊的地位。
The US also shows signs of understanding the importance of maintaining a multiethnic Kirkuk and is putting pressure on its Kurdish allies.	有迹象表明美国也了解保持基尔库克多种族环境的重要性，而且正在对自己的库尔德盟友施加压力。
Turkish diplomacy has thus become a well-calibrated balancing act, moving closer to European positions in the Middle East, but eager to maintain close relations with the US.	正因如此，土耳其外交就成了需要准确调校的平衡行动，不断在中东问题上接近欧洲立场的同时也希望与美国保持密切的关系。
If this approach succeeds, Europe's bridge to Asia may also become its bridge to America.	如果能取得成功，那么这座连接欧亚的桥梁也可能会同时沟通欧美。

NEW YORK – Sex crime has a telltale signature, even when those directing the outrages are some of the most powerful men and women in the United States.	纽约－性犯罪具有露出蛛丝马迹的特征，即使指挥这些暴行的是美国最有权力的男人或女人，也是如此。
How extraordinary, then, to learn that one of the perpetrators of these crimes, Condoleezza Rice, has just led the debate in a special session of the United Nations Security Council on the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war.	那么，得知康多莉扎·赖斯－犯下这些罪行的罪犯之一，刚刚在联合国安理会领导了一个关于把性暴力作为战争武器的辩论，是多么的令人意外。
I had a sense of déjà vu when I saw the photos that emerged in 2004 from Abu Ghraib prison.	当我在2004年看到从阿布格莱布监狱流出的照片时，我有一种似曾相识的感觉。
Even as the Bush administration was spinning the notion that the torture of prisoners was the work of “a few bad apples” low in the military hierarchy, I knew that we were seeing evidence of a systemic policy set at the top.	即使布什政府编造出是一些军队下层的“坏蛋”在折磨囚犯这样的说辞，我也知道我们看见了在美国上层的系统性政策作恶的证据。
It’s not that I am a genius. It’s simply that, having worked at a rape crisis center and been trained in the basics of sex crime, I have learned that all sex predators go about things in certain recognizable ways.	这并不是因为我是个天才，而仅仅是因为我曾在一个强奸危机中心工作过，并接受过关于性犯罪的基本知识的训练，我知道所有的性罪犯都是用一定的可识别的方式进行犯罪。
We now know that the torture of prisoners was the result of a policy set in the White House by former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Vice President Dick Cheney, and Rice – who actually chaired the torture meetings.	现在我们知道对罪犯的折磨是白宫的前国防部长唐纳德·拉姆斯菲尔德，副总统迪克·切尼以及赖斯－她实际上主持折磨会议－在白宫制定的政策的结果。
The Pentagon has also acknowledged that it had authorized sexualized abuse of detainees as part of interrogation practices to be performed by female operatives.	五角大楼也承认它授权女性特工可以用对被关押人员进行性虐待作为审问活动的一部分。
And documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union have Rumsfeld, in his own words, “checking in” on the sexualized humiliation of prisoners.	并且，美国民权同盟取得的材料显示，拉姆斯菲尔德，用他自己的话说，要对囚犯的性羞辱进行“登记 ” 。
The sexualization of torture from the top basically turned Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo Bay into an organized sex-crime ring in which the trafficked sex slaves were US-held prisoners.	从美国上层来的折磨性趋势化将阿布格莱布和关塔那摩基地变成了一个有组织的性犯罪集团，其中被交易的性奴隶是美国控制的囚犯。
Looking at the classic S and M nature of some of this torture, it is hard not to speculate that someone setting policy was aroused by all of this.	看看有些是S和M级别的折磨，很难不去推测制定这个政策的人不被这些行为引起性冲动。
The nonsexual torture that was committed ranged from beatings and suffocation, electrodes attached to genitals, and forced sleep deprivation, to prisoners being hung by the wrists from the ceiling and placed in solitary confinement until psychosis was induced.	非性折磨包括了从毒打和窒息，电击生殖器以及强迫性睡眠剥夺，到将囚犯拴住手腕吊在天花板上并单独囚禁直到其精神失常。
These abuses violate both US and international law.	这些虐待既违反了美国法又违反了国际法。
Three former military attorneys, recognizing this blunt truth, refused to participate in the “military tribunals” – rather, “show trials” – aimed at condemning men whose confessions were elicited through torture.	三位承认了这个残酷现实的前军事律师，拒绝参加目的为判处其供述是通过折磨取得的囚犯刑罚的“军事法庭 ” － 它还不如说是“审判表演 ” 。
Though we can now debate what the penalty for water-boarding should be, America as a nation, maintaining an odd silence, still cannot seem to discuss the sexual crimes involved.	虽然我们现在辩论对用模拟溺水虐待囚犯的惩罚是什么，但是美国作为一个国家，对这类行为保持了令人奇怪的沉默，似乎仍然不可能讨论这类行为中涉及的性犯罪。
Why?	为什么？
It’s not as if the sex crimes that US leaders either authorized or tolerated are not staring Americans in the face: the images of male prisoners with their heads hooded with women’s underwear; the documented reports of female US soldiers deployed to smear menstrual blood on the faces of male prisoners, and of military interrogators or contractors forcing prisoners to simulate sex with each other, to penetrate themselves with objects, or to submit to being penetrated by objects.	并不是美国领导人要么授权要么容忍的性犯罪没有注视着美国人：用女性内衣罩住头部的男性囚犯的图像；有证明文件的安排美国女兵用月经血涂抹在男性囚犯脸上，以及军事审讯人员或者军事承包人强迫囚犯相互模拟性行为，将物品插入他们的私处，或者被强迫用物品插入私处的报道。
Indeed, the Military Commissions Act of 2006 was written deliberately with loopholes that gave immunity to perpetrators of many kinds of sexual humiliation and abuse.	确实， 2006年的《特别军事法庭法案》故意为许多性羞辱和性虐待的罪犯免于惩罚留下了漏洞。
There is also the testimony by female soldiers such as Lynndie England about compelling male prisoners to masturbate, as well as an FBI memo objecting to a policy of “highly aggressive interrogation techniques.”	也有诸如林迪·英格兰这样的女兵的关于强迫男性囚犯手淫的证词，以及反对“高度激烈的审讯方法”的FBI备忘录。
The memo cites a female interrogator rubbing lotion on a shackled detainee and whispering in his ear – during Ramadan when sexual contact with a strange woman would be most offensive – then suddenly bending back his thumbs until he grimaced in pain, and violently grabbing his genitals.	该备忘录引用了一个女性审讯人员在一个戴着脚镣手铐的被押人员身上涂抹乳液并在他耳边低语的例子－在斋月，与一个陌生女人的性接触是非常犯忌的－然后突然将他的拇指往后掰直到他因疼痛而面部表情扭曲，并猛烈地抓他的生殖器。
Sexual abuse in US-operated prisons got worse and worse over time, ultimately including, according to doctors who examined detainees, anal sodomy.	随着时间的推移，在美国掌管的监狱里性虐待情况越来越严重，根据检查被押人员的医生的反映，最极端的情况还包括肛门鸡奸。
All this may sound bizarre if you are a normal person, but it is standard operating procedure for sex offenders.	如果你是一个正常人，所有这些都听起来很变态，但是这对性侵害者来说是标准的操作程序。
Those who work in the field know that once sex abusers control a powerless victim, they will invariably push the boundaries with ever more extreme behavior.	那些在这个领域工作的人都知道，一旦性虐待者控制了无力反抗的受害者，他们总是会用更极端的行为突破界限。
Abusers start by undressing their victims, but once that line has been breached, you are likely to hear from the victim about oral and anal penetration, greater and greater pain and fear being inflicted, and more and more carelessness about exposing the crimes as the perpetrator’s inhibitions fall away.	开始的时候，虐待者脱掉受害人的衣服，但是一旦突破了这个界限，你就有可能听到有关在其嘴巴插入物体和在其肛门插入物体的叙述，并且当罪犯的禁忌消失的时候，他会给受害者造成更大的痛苦和恐惧，而且对其罪行的暴露越来越不关心。
The perpetrator is also likely to engage in ever-escalating rationalizations, often arguing that the offenses serve a greater good.	罪犯也有可能将他们的行为无限合理化，并经常辩称这样做是为了达到一个的良好目的。
Finally, the victim is blamed for the abuse: in the case of the detainees, if they would only “behave,” and confess, they wouldn’t bring all this on themselves.	最后，受害者被归咎为要对受到虐待承担责任：在被押的情况下，如果他们仅仅能“表现不出格”并坦白其罪行，他们是不会招致这些东西的。
Silence, and even collusion, is also typical of sex crimes within a family.	沉默，甚至是共谋，是家庭性犯罪的特征。
Americans are behaving like a dysfunctional family by shielding sex criminals in their midst through silence.	美国人现在的表现就像是在一个机能不良的家庭内，用他们的沉默来袒护性罪犯。
Just as sex criminals – and the leaders who directed the use of rape and sexual abuse as a military strategy – were tried and sentenced after the wars in Bosnia and Sierra Leone, so Americans must hold accountable those who committed, or authorized, sex crimes in US-operated prisons.	像性罪犯一样－那些指挥使用强奸和性虐待作为军事策略的领导人－在波斯尼亚和塞拉利昂的战争过后都受到了审判并被判刑，所以美国人必须使那些从事性犯罪，或授权在美国掌管的监狱进行性犯罪的人承担责任。
Throughout the world, this perverse and graphic criminality has added fuel to anxiety about US cultural and military power.	在世界范围内，这种不正常的生动的犯罪行为加剧了人们对美国文化和军事实力的担忧。
These acts need to be called by their true names – war crimes and sex crimes – and people in America need to demand justice for the perpetrators and their victims.	这些行为应被叫它们真正的名字－战争犯罪和性犯罪－在美国的人们应该使罪犯受到审判，为受害者主持正义。
As in a family, only when people start to speak out and tell the truth about rape and sexual assault can the healing begin.	这就像是在一个家庭一那样，只有在人们开始大胆地说出强奸和性侵犯的真相时，创伤才能开始愈合。
	
Whither Africa’s “Frontier Markets”?	非洲“前沿市场”的凋谢
NEW YORK – Zimbabwe’s election appears, once again, to confirm a truism: Africa only seems to make international headlines when disasters strike – a drought, a coup, a war, a genocide, or, as in the case of Robert Mugabe, grossly incompetent government.	津巴布韦的选举好像再一次验证了这一真理，也就是非洲好像只有在干旱、政变、战争或者种族屠杀等灾害来临的时候才会成为国际头条新闻。
But, over the past several years, a number of sub-Saharan countries have attracted unprecedented inflows of foreign capital.	但是在过去几年时间里，几个萨哈拉沙漠以南国家吸引了前所未有的外国资本。
Recent global financial turmoil has only added to Africa’s allure, because its frontier markets are less vulnerable to international volatility than are most of the world’s more familiar emerging economies.	最近的全球金融风暴也只是增加了非洲的吸引力，因为与人们更为熟悉的大多数新兴市场相比，非洲前沿市场并不如此受国际市场的风吹草动影响。
There are three main reasons why many sub-Saharan countries are performing well.	萨哈拉以南国家表现优异有三个主要原因。
First, high commodity prices yield windfall profits for the region’s leading producers of raw materials.	首先，高昂的原材料价格给这一地区原材料生产国带来巨大利润。
Growing demand for energy, metals, and minerals – particularly in China – has driven unprecedented levels of foreign investment.	特别是来自中国的对能源、金属以及矿产品不断增长的需求推动了外国投资达到前所未有的水平。
Even large pension funds are beginning to take notice.	即使是大型养老基金也开始注意到了这一点。
Moreover, a large number of Africa’s poorest countries have benefited from exponential growth in (primarily United States-based) philanthropy.	而且，非洲的大量穷国也从主要来自美国的慈善事业巨大增长中获得了利益。
But, while both of these positive trends are likely to continue, a third positive factor may not prove as durable.	但是，尽管这两个积极的趋势有可能会继续，但是，第三个积极因素却未必持久。
Every year, Africans living outside the continent send roughly $30 billion to family and friends back home.	每年，在非洲大陆以外的非洲人给在非洲的亲朋好友寄大约300亿美元。
These remittances are vitally important for economic stability in several African countries. An economic slowdown in the US and Europe could substantially slow this infusion of cash, because immigrants are often the first to lose their jobs when recession fears take hold.	美国和欧洲经济放缓可能会减缓这一现金流入，因为在衰退担忧立足的时候，移民往往是首先丢掉工作。
At the same time, though Africa’s frontier economies are less vulnerable than other emerging markets to global financial turbulence, they are highly vulnerable to political turmoil closer to home.	与此同时，尽管与其他新兴市场相比，非洲的前沿经济体并不如此受到全球金融动荡的影响，它们还是容易受到临近的政治动荡的影响。
The three countries that served as pillars of regional stability for the past several years – Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa – are now too pre-occupied with political troubles of their own to provide the peacekeepers, reconstruction funds, and political pressure that often limit the damage from conflicts elsewhere in the region.	尼日利亚、肯尼亚和南非这三个在过去几年中成为地区稳定支柱的国家现在忙于应付自己的政治困难，无法提供限制该地区其他地方冲突而带来的破坏的维和士兵、重建基金以及政治压力。
Most of Nigeria’s problems are well known.	尼日利亚的大部分问题为人们所熟知。
Militants in the oil-rich Niger Delta region have at times shut down as much as 30% of the country’s oil exports, a vital source of state revenue.	盛产石油的尼日尔三角洲地区的武装人员有时候关闭该国30%的石油出口，而石油是国家财政收入的关键来源。
President Umaru Yar’Adua has taken concrete steps to tackle elite-level corruption in Nigeria, and appears to have made progress toward a comprehensive peace agreement with the Delta rebels.	亚拉杜瓦总统已经采取确实的步骤来处理尼日利亚上层腐败问题，而且好像也在与三角洲地区反叛组织达成全面和平协议的道路上取得了进展。
But Yar’Adua might soon confront a big short-term problem.	但是亚拉杜瓦可能马上会遇到一个巨大的近期麻烦。
The country’s National Election Tribunal, having overturned the outcomes of several provincial elections, may well annul the results of last year’s presidential race, forcing him to run for president all over again.	全国选举委员会推翻了几个省的选举结果，也许会宣布去年总统选举的结果无效，从而迫使他再度竞选总统。
While Yar’Adua could use the goodwill that he has built up over the past year to win by an even larger margin, the 90-day election campaign would almost certainly trigger civil unrest, and Nigeria’s leadership would be too busy navigating domestic political rivalries to help stabilize conflicts elsewhere in Africa.	尽管亚拉杜瓦可以利用在过去一年时间里建立起来的亲善来赢得更大的胜利，但是为期90天的竞选活动几乎可能会引发民间动乱，而且尼日利亚领导人将会忙于在国内政治斗争中辗转而无瑕帮助稳定非洲其他地区的冲突。
Kenya’s troubles run deeper.	肯尼亚的麻烦还要深重。
Solid economic expansion and one of the world’s fastest-growing stock markets have not helped the country avert a deepening political crisis and mounting ethnic violence since disputed presidential election results in December.	该国经济成长稳健并且拥有世界上增长最快的股票市场。 但是自从去年十二月总统选举结果受到质疑以来，这些并没有帮助这个国家避免一场日益加剧的政治危机以及种族暴力事件。
President Mwai Kibaki, whom international observers accuse of rigging the vote, has hinted at a plan to share power in a unity government, but opposition leader Raila Odinga has heard these promises before.	齐贝吉总统被国际观察员指责为操纵选举投票。 他已经暗示在团结政府中分享权力，但是反对派领导人奥廷加以前也听到多这些保证。
Odinga worked hard to help elect Kibaki in 2002, only to see Kibaki renege on a similar pledge.	奥廷加在2002年尽力帮助齐贝吉当选，而齐氏则随后食言。
Despite the alarming escalation in violence, fears of civil war in Kenya are probably exaggerated.	尽管肯尼亚暴力升级令人担忧，但是内战的担心确是有点过分。
The country’s Orange opposition movement has recently won key posts in parliament and, for the moment, is heeding calls for calm from former United nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and representatives of the African Union.	该国橙色反对派运动最近在议会中赢得了关键职位，而且目前而言，它也在听取前联合国秘书长安南以及非洲联盟代表保持冷静的呼吁。
But no one should expect Kenya to play a stabilizing regional role again anytime soon.	但是人们不应当指望肯尼亚马上再次发挥地区性稳定作用。
The continent’s third pillar, South Africa, will spend 2008 mired in an escalating political feud between Thabo Mbeki, the lame-duck president, and Jacob Zuma, a former deputy who is the newly elected leader of the ruling African National Congress and the leading candidate to succeed Mbeki, his bitter rival, next year.	非洲大陆的第三根支柱南非将会在即将卸任的总统姆贝基和前任副总统祖玛之间日益升级的政治争斗下度过2008年。 而后者刚刚当选为非洲国民大会领导人并且是明年接替其死对手姆贝基的主要侯选人。
South Africa’s courts have become a political battleground, as Mbeki and his allies use corruption charges to try to cripple Zuma’s candidacy.	当姆贝基及其同盟者利用腐败指控来摧毁祖玛的候选资格的时候，南非的法院也已经成为政治战场。
The resulting political firestorm may well force Zuma to rely on core support from key allies within the country’s trade union movement and Communist Party, challenging the political elite’s pro-market consensus and provoking debate over the future of South Africa’s economic policy.	接下来的政治风暴或许会迫使祖玛依赖于南非工会运动和共产党的主要盟友的支持来挑战政治精英亲市场的共识并且促发有关未来南非经济政策的辩论。
No countries in sub-Saharan Africa will have the economic heft and political self-confidence to replace Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa as pillars of stability anytime soon.	萨哈拉沙漠以南国家中没有一个会马上具有足够的经济实力和政治自信来取代尼日利亚、肯尼亚和南非成为稳定的支柱。
Regional blocs like the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Southern African Customs Union (SACU), and the East African Community (EAC) will eventually assume larger roles in helping resolve the continent’s most intractable diplomatic and economic problems.	类似西非国家经济共同体、南部非洲关税联盟以及东非共同体那样的地区性组织最终将会在帮助解决非洲最为棘手的外交和经济问题上发挥更大的作用。
But that won’t happen this year.	但是这种情况今年不会出现。
There remain many good reasons for investors to take a chance on Africa’s frontier markets.	投资者有许多理由在非洲前沿市场上进行冒险。
But it will not necessarily take a drought, a coup, a war, or a genocide to make them think twice.	但是，这并不一定要用干旱、战争或者种族屠杀才能够让他们三思。
	
Whither Europe?	欧洲将向何处去？
BEIJING – With the likelihood of a contagious sovereign-debt implosion and European bank failures greatly reduced by the Greek debt deal and the European Central Bank’s lending program, it is time to look ahead.	北京—希腊债务协议的达成和欧洲央行贷款计划的实施大幅减少了传染性主权债去大爆发和欧洲央行大批倒闭的可能性，现在，我们应该把目光朝前看。
Where do the European Union, the eurozone, and the EU’s highly indebted countries go from here?	欧盟、欧元区以及债务沉重的欧元区成员国将何去何从？
Will Europe be able to roll back its welfare states’ biggest excesses without economic distress and social unrest toppling governments and, in the peripheral countries, undermining already-tenuous agreements with creditors?	欧洲能够成功地减少其福利国家最大的国度支出项，同时又不引起经济灾难、颠覆政府的社会动荡并且（在外围国家）不影响弱不禁风的债权人协议。
Some good news globally will have an impact on how these questions are resolved.	全球范围内的一些好消息将对这些问题的解决产生影响。
The United States’ economy is gradually reviving, albeit slowly by the standards of recovery from a deep recession.	美国经济正在逐步恢复活力，尽管从深度衰退复苏的角度看显得相当缓慢。
China, Brazil, and India have not decoupled from their customers in Europe and North America, and so are slowing, though a relatively soft landing is likely if Europe’s recession is as short and mild as predicted.	中国、巴西和印度并没有与欧洲和北美的消费者脱钩，因此，尽管它们正在减速，但若欧洲的衰退如预计那样缓慢而温和，它们可以实现相对较“软”的着陆。
The EU’s economic output and population are larger than that of the US, so the fate of the 27 EU countries is everyone’s business, from New York to New Delhi, São Paulo to Shanghai.	欧盟的经济产出和人口数量都要高于美国，因此其17个成员国的命运与我们所有人息息相关，不管你身处纽约还是新德里，圣保罗还是上海。
Formed originally as a free-trade area, the eurozone comprises 17 of the countries.	由自由贸易区演变而成的欧元区拥有17个成员国。
Knitting together 17 disparate economies, cultures, and institutions was a monumental undertaking, fraught with risk.	将17个经济、文化和制度都大相径庭的国家捆绑在一起是一项伟业，需要面临重重危险。
The Lisbon Treaty emphasizes unanimity in decision-making.	里斯本条约强调决策的一致同意。
With some members inside of the eurozone, and others remaining outside of it, and with disparate economic interests and monetary and fiscal traditions even within the eurozone, agreement is difficult.	里斯本条约缔约国既有欧元区成员国，也有非欧元区成员国，每个国家都有不同的经济利益和货币和财政传统（即使同处于欧元区的国家也不例外 ） ， 因此达成一致是很困难的。
That sets the stage for three broad scenarios, each with implications for the European and global economy, the financial and banking system, and relations between the member states and EU institutions.	这就次年改成了三个大方向，每一个都对欧洲和全球经济、金融和财政体系以及欧盟成员国和欧盟机构之间的关系具有影响。
In the first scenario, a more united and homogeneous Europe emerges from the crisis, enforcing greater restrictions on member states’ budgets to reduce apparent risk.	第一个方向是一个更统一、更相近的欧洲从危机中站立起来，给成员国的预算施加更严格的限制，以减少显而易见的风险。
Accompanied by a strong, broad eurozone, risk of a future currency crisis remains.	强大而广大的欧元区的出现并不能完全消除未来货币危机风险。
In the second scenario, a two- or three-tiered Europe includes a two-tiered euro, with the weaker countries using a separate “euro-B” currency that can float against the stronger economies’ “euro-A.”	第二个方向是出现一个两到三个层次的欧洲，使用两层次的欧元设计，疲软国家使用单独的“B欧元”货币，其对坚挺国所使用的“A欧元”汇率可以浮动。
This arrangement would hold out the promise to fiscally stressed economies that, if they get their act together, they could rejoin euro-A – and do so more readily than they could from their own currency.	这一安排可以让财政不堪重负的国家维持承诺，如果它们采取一致行动，可以重新回到A欧元集团 — — 比它们使用自己的货币要容易得多。
In the final scenario, what emerges is a more decentralized Europe, with less top-down agreement in areas beyond trade and a smaller, more homogeneous eurozone composed of the EU’s core economies.	最后一个方向是出现一个分散化的欧洲，不会有多少超越贸易层次的自上而下的协定，欧元区也会缩小，仅由品质均较好的核心欧盟国家组成。
Such a construct would be far more popular with citizens who are unhappy with the accretion of EU power in Brussels and the loss of traditional sovereignty.	反对扩大欧盟权力、减少传统主权的人士将会较为欢迎这种结构。
Some current euro members – Greece (and perhaps others) – would revert to national currencies.	一些现有欧元区成员国（希腊，可能还有其他国家）将恢复国家货币。
None of these options is easy; each entails serious difficulties and great risks.	这三种选择都是艰难的选择，每一种都伴随着严重的困难和极高的风险。
Episodic muddling through may be the best that can be hoped for.	阶段性的得过且过或许是人们最希望的选择。
For example, how would Greece (or any country) exit the euro in order to cushion the extreme downward wage adjustment required to regain competitiveness, and to avoid the severe social unrest that could result from reining in debt too rapidly?	比如，如果希腊（或任何国家）为了缓冲重获竞争力所需要的极端工资下调压力以及避免过快减债所造成的严重社会动荡而退出欧元区将会怎样？
As soon as word got out that Greece was seriously considering such a move – well before it could even generate a new drachma currency – euro bank deposits would flee Greece.	只要希腊认真考虑这一选择的消息一出 — — 就算它还来不及铸造新的德拉克马货币 — — 欧元银行存款就会争相逃离希腊。
As a result, Greece would be forced to impose capital controls.	结果，希腊将被迫采取资本管制。
Some contracts denominated in euros would be subject to Greek law, some to European law, and others – for example, derivatives contracts – to British or US law.	一些用欧元计价的合同将由希腊法律来裁定，一些将由欧洲法律来裁定，而其他，比如衍生品合约，将由英国或美国法律来裁定。
Legal chaos would result.	这将会产生法律混乱。
Yet sticking to the euro and forcing all of the adjustments in wages risks greater unrest; indeed, it might merely postpone the inevitable.	但死抱欧元不放、强行采取工资调整有可能导致严重动乱；事实上，这只能延缓不可避免之事的发生。
Governments and the bond market will test the seriousness of the newly agreed fiscal guidelines (if they are ratified).	政府和债券市场将考验新达成的财政指导协议（如果被批准的话 ） 。
While talk is tough now, the history of such agreements does not inspire optimism.	现在，谈判仍在艰难进行中，而历史表明，此类协议并不会激发乐观情绪。
Before the financial crisis, even Germany violated the EU Stability and Growth Pact’s (SGP) deficit limits.	在金融危机爆发前，即使是德国也违反了欧洲增长和稳定公约（GSP）的债务上限规定。
In the US, the 1980’s deficit limits set by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law were not met, and, like the SGP, were revised and extended.	在美国，1980年的格拉姆-罗德曼-霍林斯（Gramn-Rudman-Hollings）法所规定的赤字上限从未被执行过，与GSP一样，该上限也被修订和扩大了。
Agreements with, and access to, the International Monetary Fund and Europe’s new bailout fund provide (soft) constraints.	关于如何才能获得IMF和欧洲新成立的援助基金的协议倒是能产生一定的（软）约束。
Regardless of how these governance and fiscal issues are resolved, or muddled through, Europe’s banks remain a thorny issue.	不论这些治理和财政问题如何被解决，或只是得过且过，欧洲银行的日子都不会好过。
With the time afforded by the ECB’s three-year cheap loans, they have some breathing room to rebuild their capital and clean up their balance sheets.	欧洲央行的三年期廉价贷款计划为欧洲银行赢得了时间，使它们能够重建资本基础、清理资���负债表。
But, while doing so, they are not likely to be expanding private-sector lending to support economic growth.	但是，在此期间，它们很可能不会扩张私人部门贷款以支持经济增长。
European banks are far more thinly capitalized, and account for a much larger share of credit extended, than banks in the US, where much more lending originates in capital markets.	与美国银行相比，欧洲银行的资本严重不足，而且信用扩张主要通过银行来进行。
Most large US banks – Citi is an exception – passed US Federal Reserve stress tests recently, with enough capital to withstand a hypothetical deep recession (13% unemployment, a 21% further fall in home prices, and a 50% stock-market decline).	大部分美国大银行（花旗是个例外）都通过了最近的美联储压力测试，有足够的资本抵御假设的深度衰退（失业率13 % 、 房价继续下跌21 % 、 股票继续下跌50 % ） 。
Europe’s stress tests have been much weaker.	欧洲的压力测试要宽松得多。
Some sort of Brady bond to reduce and extend excessive sovereign debt will be necessary.	某种形式的布雷迪债券 — — 以减少和延期过重的主权债务 — — 看来是必不可少的。
We can expect further European turmoil – from banks, sovereign debt, and social unrest in response to even modest welfare-state rollbacks – and clashing visions, within and among countries, concerning the desirability of deeper European integration.	我们可以预期，欧洲（各国内部和国与国之间）将出现更多的动荡 — — 银行、主权债务、即使是略有削减的福利国家政策也会引起社会动荡 — — 面临更糟糕的前景，这使得欧洲一体化的客观需要进一步加大了。
Europe has come a long way from the days when its leaders prophesied that the euro would quickly rival the dollar as a global reserve currency.	欧洲距离其领导人所宣称的欧元将很快崛起为可与美元分庭抗礼的全球储备货币还有很长一段距离。
Yet no one should write off Europe.	但没人可以小觑欧洲。
It still has great strengths, and, with sensible reforms, the EU can survive and eventually return to greater prosperity and stability.	欧洲仍然坚挺，只要实施合理的改革，欧盟就能生存下来并最终实现更大的繁荣和稳定。
But Europe remains closer to the beginning of that process of renewal than to the end.	欧洲距离开启涅槃改革要比距离走向衰亡更近。
	
Whither North Korea?	北朝鲜何去何从？
SEOUL – According to North Korean state television, the heart attack that killed Kim Jong-il on December 17 was “due to severe mental and physical stress from overwork.”	首尔 — — 据朝鲜电视台报道，12月17日致金正日死亡的心脏病发作是因“过度劳累引发的严重的精神和身体压力导致的 。 ”
That report instantly raised a question in my mind: if we accept the regime’s diagnosis, why did Kim need to work so hard, despite his frail health?	读了这份报告，我脑海中立即闪现出一个疑问：如果接受朝鲜政权的结论，那么金正日为什么要在身体虚弱时这么努力工作？
In some sense, his sudden death seems to symbolize the helplessness of a desperate leader confronting overwhelming challenges.	从某种意义上讲，他的猝死似乎表明了一位陷入绝望的领导人在面对巨大挑战时的无奈。
Seen in this light, the more important question is whether or not Kim’s inexperienced son, the twenty-something “Great Successor” Kim Jong-un, will be able to consolidate power and somehow steer the country out of its deep malaise.	由此看来，更重要的问题是金正日缺乏经验的儿子、年仅二十多岁的“伟大接班人”金正恩能否成功地巩固政权，并以某种方式引导这个国家走出极度困境。
So far, the succession in Pyongyang seems to be proceeding in an orderly fashion.	从目前情况看，平壤的权力交接似乎正在有序进行中。
But, despite appearances, few totalitarian regimes, save those of Hitler, Stalin, and Mao, have ever maintained a monolithic inner circle of power.	但尽管表面平稳，但除希特勒、斯大林和毛泽东外，没有几个独裁政权的权力核心能始终保持铁板一块。
North Korea is unlikely to be an exception to this rule.	朝鲜也不太可能例外。
The legitimacy of Kim Jong-un’s claim to power is weak, despite his blood tie to his father and grandfather, the dynasty that has ruled North Korea since its inception.	金氏家族自建国伊始就一直统治朝鲜，虽然与父亲及祖父有血缘关系，但金正恩接权的合法性依然相对薄弱。
The “Great Successor” has had barely two years of on-the-job training, compared to the 14 years his father spent studying directly under Kim Il-sung.	“伟大的接班人”仅仅接受过两年的在职培训，而他的父亲在金日成手下直接学习长达14年之久。
Of course, Kim Jong-il’s sister, Kim Kyung-hee, and his sister-in-law, Jang Seong-taek, will assume something of a regency role, acting both as patron to the Great Successor and as a force to mobilize the military to close ranks behind the Kim dynasty.	当然，金正日的妹妹金敬姬和他的妹夫张成泽将在一定程度上起到摄政作用，既扮演“伟大接班人”的支持者，又动员军队紧密团结在金氏家族周围。
But it is not clear how faithfully, and for how long, Kim Kyung-hee and Jang will remain supportive of Kim Jong-un.	但金敬姬和张成泽对于金正恩的忠诚度还无法确定，也不知道他们能够支持他多久。
They might even try to supplant Kim by claiming power for themselves.	这两人甚至可能试图取代金正恩把权力控制在自己手中。
Another challenge may come from the country’s senior leaders, especially among the military. Will they remain faithful to Kim, who is 40-50 years their junior?	另一个挑战可能来自国家的高级领导人，特别是军队。 比他们小四五十岁的金正恩能否获得他们的效忠？
It is known that some senior military officers were quietly critical of Kim Jong-il’s failure in managing the country’s relationship with the United States and Japan.	众所周知某些高级军官私下对金正日未能管理好美日关系有诸多批评。
Their expectation might have been that North Korea could improve relations with the US while retaining its nuclear weapons, in exchange for not developing long-range missiles.	他们本来希望朝鲜以放弃发展远程导弹为代价，在保留核武器的同时改善朝美关系。
After all, if Pakistan did it, why not North Korea?	毕竟，如果巴基斯坦能这么做，朝鲜为什么不能？
Had that happened, economic assistance from the US and Japan would have flowed into North Korea, enabling the regime to manage the country’s moribund economy much better without initiating reforms, which the military appears to regard as dangerous.	如果实现这一计划，来自美日的经济援助就会流入朝鲜，使朝鲜政府在无需启动改革的情况下挽救奄奄一息的国内经济，这种举措被军队视为危险的。
Instead, with the economy, particularly food production, continuing to falter, perhaps one-third of the country is living at or below starvation levels.	相反，随着经济、特别是粮食生产持续衰退，或许有三分之一的朝鲜人挣扎在饥荒线上下。
Will Kim Jong-un leader be able to do better?	金正恩能做得更好吗？
In the early stages of this precarious succession, China has behaved as expected, trying to prop up the regime in order to ensure stability in its nuclear-armed neighbor.	在此次不稳定继承的早期阶段，中国的表现不出所料，北京试图支持朝鲜政府，以稳定这个拥有核武器的邻国的局势。
China’s foreign ministry sent a strong message of support for Kim Jong-un, and encouraged North Koreans to unite under the new leader.	中国外交部强烈表示支持金正恩，并鼓励朝鲜人民团结在新领袖的周围。
But the key external factor in ensuring a peaceful succession will be the policies of South Korea and the US, which must decide whether they can work with the North in the post-Kim Jong-il era.	但韩美政策才是确保和平继承顺利实现的关键外部因素，这两国必须确定能否在后金正日时代与朝鲜合作。
Will they wait to see what happens to the new leader, and thus continue their policy of “strategic patience,” which focuses mainly on denuclearization, and not move on to other areas until the North moves first?	他们是否会继续奉行以无核化为主的“战略耐心”政策，让朝鲜率先在其他领域采取行动，静候新领袖出现结果？
In that case, North Korea will gradually become more unstable, despite China’s support, as economic collapse undermines its quasi-legitimate leadership.	如若真是如此，即便拥有中国的支持，朝鲜仍将因为经济萎缩会影响其准合法领导地位而逐渐丧失稳定局面。
Or will South Korea and the US try to take advantage of Kim Jong-il’s passing with new policy initiatives?	韩美两国是否会借金正日去世之机推行新的政策？
If they can develop a two-track policy framework aimed at facilitating economic reform inside North Korea while continuing international pressure for denuclearization, constructive engagement may be possible.	如果他们能成功制定双轨制的政策框架，在推动朝鲜经济改革的同时继续保持国际无核化压力，就有可能实现建设性的接触。
Alas, next year is an election year in South Korea and the US.	可叹的是明年韩美两国即将举行大选。
In the feverish atmosphere of political high season, it will not be easy for incumbent administrations to pursue bold but risky policies.	在政治旺季的狂热氛围中，现任政府大胆采取冒险政策面临着很大的难度。
This is the agony of democracy, and it is why the next year may prove to be the most unstable, and even dangerous, period in decades for the Korean peninsula and the region.	这是民主之痛，同时也解释了明年为什么可能成为朝鲜半岛及地区数十年来最不稳定、甚至是最危险的阶段。
What happens if things go the wrong way?	如果局势朝着错误的方向发展后果将是什么？
What if, for example, Kim Jong-un fails to consolidate power, perceives the domestic political situation as worsening, owing to elite power struggles or popular discontent, and deems the external environment, especially South Korea and the US ever more hostile?	比方说，如果金正恩未能巩固权力，因为精英权力斗争抑或民众不满而认定国内政局恶化，同时认定外部环境，特别是韩美两国更加充满敌意将带来什么后果？
In that case, Kim III may grasp at provocation in one form or another, as his father did with intermittent attacks on South Korea in recent years.	如果真是如此，金氏家族第三代统治者将以这样或者那样的方式进行挑衅，就像其父近年来断断续续对韩国发动袭击那样。
If things do worsen even more, the world, like it or not, must be prepared to manage – and even confront – a scenario in which the Kim dynasty, and with it the North Korean state, collapses.	如果局势进一步恶化，无论世界各国是否愿意，都必须准备应对 — — 甚至解决金氏王朝，甚至连带朝鲜政府陷入崩溃的状况。
Unfortunately, considering the current state of ill-preparedness in terms of international coordination, there will be confusion, misunderstanding, and overreaction among South Korea, the US, and China to other actors’ behavior.	遗憾的是，鉴于目前国际合作准备不足的窘境，韩、美、中之间肯定会出现混乱、误解和过度反应的状况。
So it is past time for all three powers, together with Japan and Russia, to start talking and planning ahead, jointly.	因此韩美中三国，以及日本和俄罗斯早就应当开启联合会谈和提前计划了。
A chaotic, imploding North Korea is in no one’s interest.	混乱、一触即发的朝��局势是不符合各方利益的。
	
Whither Pakistan?	逐渐枯萎的巴基斯坦？
LAHORE – Pakistan remains the world’s never-ending question.	拉合尔 — — 巴基斯坦仍然是全世界一个没完没了的问题。
As 2010 concludes, several outstanding issues continue to bedevil the country.	2010年末，几个悬而未决的问题仍然困扰着巴基斯坦。
How they are managed in the year ahead will determine not only Pakistan’s immediate future and long-term prospects, but also the security of its region and, indeed, much of the world.	这几个问题不仅将决定巴基斯坦的短期和长远命运，而且将影响到该地区和世界绝大多数地区的安全局势。
It has been said – without exaggeration – that Pakistan faces an existential threat.	有人说巴基斯坦正面临着现实威胁，此言一点不虚。
The country has not defined a coherent approach towards those who are resorting to terrorism to advance their agendas, both within Pakistan and abroad.	巴基斯坦对国内和国外借助恐怖手段实现目标的极端份子缺乏一以贯之的态度。
It remains uncommitted to the idea of denying sanctuaries on its territory to Taliban fighters battling American and NATO troops in Afghanistan.	它仍然对拆毁阿富汗反美反北约塔利班分子在其领土上修建的避难所表现得并不积极。
Relations with India have soured in recent months, because Pakistan’s government is once again lending diplomatic support to the insurgency in Indian-controlled Kashmir.	与印度关系也在近几个月急转直下，因为巴基斯坦政府再次给印控克什米尔叛乱人员提供外交方面的支持。
Domestic terrorism in Pakistan has taken a heavy human and economic toll.	巴基斯坦的国内恐怖主义已经造成了惨重的人员伤亡和经济损失。
It is no longer aimed at official support of United States-led anti-terrorism activities.	恐怖主义所针对的已经不再是美国领导下官方支持的反恐行动。
Sunni Islamic extremists now target minority groups as well as other Muslim sects.	逊尼派伊斯兰极端分子现在既攻击其他穆斯林教派也攻击少数族裔。
Some 800 liberal and Sufi Islamic scholars have died in targeted killings by extremist groups who receive financial assistance from like-minded people in the Middle East, and some well-known and much-visited Sufi shrines have been bombed.	约800名自由和苏非派伊斯兰学者在由中东同道提供财务支持的极端组织针对性杀戮中丧生，某些人流量大的知名苏非派寺庙也遭遇炸弹袭击。
The economy is in shambles, and unable to meet the International Monetary Fund demands for its continued support.	国内经济一片混乱，无法达到国际货币基金组织继续援助的要求。
If the IMF terminates its current program, Pakistan will be unable to service its foreign debt.	如果国际货币基金组织终止援助计划，巴基斯坦的外债将陷入无法偿还的境地。
Indeed, a senior cabinet minister suggested recently that the international community should write off Pakistan’s debts – an amount estimated at $40 billion.	实际上，一名高级内阁部长不久前提出国际社会应取消巴基斯坦总额约400亿美元的外债。
The minister of finance forcefully repudiated the suggestion the following day, indicating that the government has not developed a consistent approach towards the faltering economy.	财政部长第二天就出面驳斥了这种说法，表示政府尚未制定统一措施来挽救低迷的经济。
The economy was also badly hurt by the massive floods of 2010, which caused damage estimated at $10 billion.	2010年的大洪水也对经济造成了影响，造成约100亿美元的巨额损失。
This damage could lower annual GDP growth by 1-1.5% for several years to come.	这可能使巴基斯坦未来几年的年均GDP增长降低1－1.5个百分点。
In the 2010-2011 fiscal year, the IMF estimates that economic output will increase by less than 3% – one-third the rate expected in neighboring India and less than half that of Bangladesh.	2010－2011财年，国际货币基金组织估计经济增长将低于3 % — —这样的速度只有邻国印度的三分之一左右，还不到孟加拉共和国的一半。
Slower economic growth will cause a shortfall of jobs for new entrants to the workforce, thereby increasing the incidence of poverty.	经济增长放缓将加大新增劳动力的就业缺口，从而提高贫困的几率。
Indeed, the number of people living in absolute poverty is likely to increase by 10 million, bringing the total to more than 70 million, or 40% of the population.	事实上，绝对贫困人口可能增加1000万以上，总数达到7000多万，或占总人口的40 % 。
Pakistan thus ends 2010 as the sick man of South Asia.	巴基斯坦就这样以南亚病夫的形象结束了2010之旅。
The political system also remains unsettled.	政治体系同样充满动荡。
Despite passage in July of the 18th amendment to the Pakistani constitution, which restored it to the form in which it was promulgated in 1973, political and executive authority remains in the hands of President Asif Ali Zardari.	尽管7月18日巴基斯坦宪法修正案获得通过，从而使宪法恢复到1973年颁布时的形式，但掌握政治和行政大权的仍然是巴基斯坦总统阿西夫·阿里·扎尔达里。
The changes are supposed to make the executive branch accountable to the elected parliament, expand the prime minister’s authority, devolve more power to the provinces, and ensure independence to the judiciary.	修宪旨在让行政部门对当选议会负责，扩大总理权力，下放权力给地方各省，并确保司法独立。
In late 2009, the president also approved the seventh National Finance Commission, which will allocate to the provinces a larger share of the revenues collected by the central government.	2009年末，总统还批准召开第七次全国金融委员会，批准将中央政府收入的更大份额向地方财政拨付。
But a significant transfer of power from the presidency to parliament, or from the central to provincial governments, has yet to be brought about.	但从总统到议会、从中央到地方的大规模权力转移还远未完成。
Worse yet, the military remains outside civilian control.	更糟糕的是，军队仍然不接受文人控制。
General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani’s term in office, which was set to expire in November, was extended by three years.	原定于11月结束的卡亚尼将军的任期更是延长了三年。
Thus empowered, the general has been able to exert his influence over foreign policy, in particular in defining the country’s relations with the US, India, and Afghanistan.	得到授权后，将军就有权干预外交政策，特别是影响巴基斯坦与美国、印度和阿富汗的关系。
Even though the US offered $2 billion of assistance to the military to be disbursed over a period of 3-5 years, Kayani has resisted American pressure to move against the Taliban’s sanctuary in North Waziristan, used to stage operations against US and NATO troops in southern and eastern Afghanistan.	尽管美国已经在3－5年内提供了20亿美元的军事援助，卡亚尼将军依然抵制了美国攻击塔利班北瓦济里斯坦庇护所的压力，恐怖分子利用当地庇护所在阿富汗东南部对美国和北约部队发起攻击。
So, is a further increase in violence by various extremist groups likely?	那么各极端组织是否可能扩大使用暴力？
Will the economy collapse if the IMF withdraws its support?	国际货币基金组织撤销援助是否会导致经济崩溃？
Will the US increase its pressure by intervening militarily if Pakistan continues to harbor Taliban fighters operating from the tribal areas?	如果巴基斯坦继续庇护隐藏在部族区域的塔利班武装分子，美国是否会加大军事干预的压力？
Will the military subvert the constitutional changes aimed at reforming the political system?	改革政治体系的修宪活动是否会遭到军队的暗中破坏？
Despite all the grim news and auguries, there is some hope, owing to the increased political mobilization of Pakistan’s middle classes, whose members have finally begun to question those espousing extremism.	尽管存在所有这些不详的信息和预兆，但巴基斯坦中产阶级政治力量的增强仍然为问题的解决保留着一线生机，新兴的中产阶级终于开始质疑支持极端主义。
The judiciary is also more active, and is attempting to force the executive to remain within the bounds of the constitution.	司法系统也更加活跃，并试图迫使行政部门在宪法的范围内行事。
Moreover, a trade agreement with Afghanistan that allows Afghan goods to cross Pakistan en route to India may be one step towards an improvement of economic relations with that large and rapidly growing neighbor.	此外，与阿富汗签订允许阿富汗货物过境运往印度的贸易协议可能是与这个高速发展的邻国改善经济关系的第一步。
Indeed, an able economic team that has been installed in the government seems – at long last – to be addressing some of the economy’s deep structural flaws.	事实上，政府组建的有能力的经济团体似乎终于开始解决某些深层次的经济结构性问题。
As India in the 1990’s and Brazil in the early 2000’s showed, economies in deep distress can recover quickly once the right policies are implemented.	正如20世纪90年代的印度和21世纪的巴西所表明的那样，实行正确的经济政策可以令经济从危机中迅速复苏。
It could also happen in Pakistan, which would help to solve other, seemingly intractable problems.	这一点在巴基斯坦也不例外，而且经济的发展有可能解决似乎非常棘手的其他问题。
So all hope is not lost in Pakistan.	因此巴基斯坦并未失去所有的希望。
On the contrary, 2011 may well prove to be a better year for a battered economy and a political system under stress.	恰恰相反，历史可能证明2011年对其陷于困境的经济和承受压力的政治体系来讲是一次机遇。
	
Whither the Egyptian Revolution?	埃及革命何去何从？
WASHINGTON, DC – Egypt’s revolution toppled a dictator in February, but the country’s future as a stable, functioning democracy remains uncertain.	华盛顿 — — 2月，埃及革命推翻了独裁者，但埃及是否能够成为一个正常运转的稳定民主国家还远未尘埃落定。
The West is, of course, limited in its ability to shape the transition process.	当然，西方在决定埃及转型过程方面只能起到有限作用。
Nonetheless, the potential for constructive influence remains considerable, and it should be responsive to those in Egypt who favor liberal ideas, democratic institutions, and broad distribution of the benefits of economic development.	尽管如此，西方仍具有相当可观的潜在建设性影响力，对于支持自由思想、民主制度以及让经济发展惠及全埃及的埃及人，西方应该有所反应。
The upcoming parliamentary elections are but an early stage in a long (perhaps decades-long) struggle to define the new Egypt.	即将到来的议会选举只是迈向新埃及的漫长斗争的第一步，整个过程可能会持续数十年。
Will Egypt gravitate toward Islamic theocracy or adopt a secular government that respects minority rights?	埃及将滑向伊斯兰神权政体，还是会产生一个尊重少数派权利的世俗政府？
Which economic policies – statist, liberal, or some combination of the two – will best ensure social justice and broad distribution of prosperity?	哪些经济政策能最好地确保社会公平和惠及广大埃及人民的繁荣？ 是中央计划体制，还是自由经济，还是两者的结合？
Can civilian control of the military be established?	是否会建立由人民掌控的军队？
Will the regional security structure formed around the United States, Egypt, and Israel survive?	围绕美国、埃及以及以色列的地区安全结构是否能保留下来？
The November elections will not resolve these fundamental questions, and whether a workable constitutional framework will develop is uncertain.	11月的选举解决不了基本问题，且是否能产生一个有效的宪法框架还不确定。
A parliamentary system of government will likely emerge, including a prime minister and a cabinet, with the strong possibility that the presidency will be politically overshadowed, particularly if the presidential election is delayed.	到时可能会产生一个政府议会体系，包括一位总理和一个内阁，总统的政治影响力很有可能会受到压制，特别是若总统选举被推迟的话。
The central unknown is the composition of the ruling coalition.	最大的未知数是执政联盟的组成。
It appears unlikely that a single party will emerge from the election with enough parliamentary seats to govern on its own.	看起来不太可能有哪个单一政党能从选举中胜出，获得足够席位单独执政。
So a coalition government will be necessary.	因此联合政府将是无可避免之事。
The political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood (the Freedom and Justice Party) currently is the best-organized party, and may be in the strongest position to form a majority coalition, including Salafist elements.	目前，穆斯林兄弟会（Muslim Brotherhood）的政治部门（即自由和公平党（Freedom and Justice Party ） ） 拥有最好的组织形态，最可能组成一个包括沙拉菲派（Salafist）在内的多数联盟。
By contrast, secular liberal parties have yet to develop effective organizations or project compelling visions for the future.	相反，世俗的自由派政党尚没有建立起高效组织，也没有提出吸引眼球的未来愿景。
Although sentiment favoring a secular state is considerable, a coalition that can serve as an alternative or counterweight to the Muslim Brotherhood will be difficult to assemble.	尽管埃及社会支持建立世俗国家的情绪相当高涨，但很难建立起一个足以与穆斯林兄弟会相抗衡甚至取而代之的联盟。
In the near term, the most likely counterweight could be a liberal coalition with a heavy component of former members of deposed President Hosni Mubarak’s National Democratic Party (NDP) – that is, those who have not been discredited by their association with Mubarak.	从短期看，最可能的抗衡者将是一个以下台总统穆巴拉克的国家民主党（NDP）为重要组成部分自由派的联盟 — — 也就是说，这将是一群因与穆巴拉克有过合作而失去了信誉的人。
Election rules favor those who were organized before the revolution.	选举规则对在革命前就组织起来的政党有利。
Approximately one-third of the new parliament will comprise “non-party list” candidates.	新议会将有大约三分之一席位被“无党派”候选人占据。
Established networks based on family, local loyalties, and tribal affiliations will be key determinants in voting.	基于家庭、地方忠诚和部落势力的现有网络将成为选票的决定性因素。
These circumstances may favor “non-party list” candidates associated with the Muslim Brotherhood and the former NDP, particularly in rural Egypt.	这样的环境可能有利于与穆斯林兄弟会和前NDP有关联的“无党派”候选人，特别是在埃及农村地区。
Post-election shifts in the composition of coalitions could complicate the situation, making governance even more difficult.	各联盟在选举之后的成分变迁将使情况复杂化，让治国难上加难。
Power-sharing among coalition partners will be an intricate affair, including behind-the-scenes deals with the military, which will insist on measures to safeguard its interests.	联盟伙伴之间的权力分割错综复杂，包括与军方的幕后交易 — — 后者肯定会坚持采取捍卫其自身利益的措施。
The political atmosphere in Egypt remains volatile.	埃及的政治氛围仍然极不稳定。
Expectations of economic improvement are extremely high.	人们对于经济改善的期望极高。
The initial elected government may pay an early political price for failure.	如果最初选出的政府不能满足人们的期望，将为此付出政治代价。
The starting point for the West in trying to assist Egypt’s transition must be recognition that patient, long-term engagement will be required.	西方援助埃及转型的起点应该是认识到这是一项需要耐心和长期参与的事情。
The effectiveness of this engagement will depend primarily on the persuasiveness of the West’s policy prescriptions, rather than on the volume of financial assistance.	西方的介入能否见效，主要取决于西方政治药方是否具有说服力，而不是财政援助手笔有多大。
G-8 countries have already pledged support to post-Mubarak Egypt, including economic aid, debt relief, and loan guarantees.	G8国家已经承诺支持后穆巴拉克时代的埃及，包括经济援助、债务纾困和贷款担保。
These steps are important, though delivery will be prolonged and the likely impact modest, at least in the near-term.	这些举措都是十分重要的，但实现过程将会十分漫长，效果至少在短期是有限的。
Egypt has already declined support from the International Monetary Fund.	埃及已然回绝了IMF的支持。
But, apart from an IMF-backed reform program, if the Egyptian government’s policy framework is right, resources will flow from the private sector, including foreign investment supportive of job creation and economic development.	但是，除了IMF的改革计划之外，如果政府的政策框架对头，那么埃及还可以从私人部门获得资源，包括有利于就业创造和经济发展的外国投资。
This is the message that Egypt needs to grasp and embrace.	这一点是埃及需要抓住并牢牢把握的。
G-8 governments should urgently and repeatedly undertake quiet, structured, and consistent communications with Egyptian counterparts about the economic reforms needed to bring about prosperity.	G8政府迫切需要反复与埃及政府就实现繁荣的所需的经济改革进行静悄悄、结构性、持续性的对话。
It is far too early to judge the strength of internal forces promoting liberal economic policies.	断言有利于自由经济政策的内部推动力有多强还为时尚早。
The need for economic growth could intrinsically push policymakers toward market-oriented economic policies (sensitive to considerations of “social justice”) and an open investment environment.	经济增长的需要将成为推动政客采取市场导向的经济政策（这对“社会公正”十分重要）和开放的投资环境的内因。
Powerful forces within the Egyptian business community are silent at the moment, but in time will reassert themselves.	眼下，埃及商界内部的强大力量还没有发声，但迟早会表明自己的立场。
Many business interests with job-creating capacity want the continuation of market-oriented reforms begun a decade ago (which produced impressive growth rates), but support broadening prosperity and rooting out corruption.	许多与就业创造能力息息相关的商业利益希望十年前开始的市场导向改革（创造了令人印象深刻的增长率）能够继续下去，同时也支持扩大繁荣、根除腐败。
Moreover, an independent media might tend to reinforce pro-market and democratic sentiment.	此外��独立媒体也能强化支持市场和民主的情绪。
Indeed, Western governments should continue to use their channels to the Egyptian military and future civil leadership to encourage them to uphold the rule of law, to act with restraint, and to respect free expression.	事实上，西方政府应该继续利用与埃及军方和未来民事领导人的渠道来促使他们赞成法治精神、保持行动克制、尊重言论自由。
Regional security arrangements will also require careful maintenance.	地区安全安排也需要小心维持。
Finally, countries supportive of a democratic Egypt should focus on encouraging the institutional and social underpinnings of democratic process and market reform.	最后，支持民主埃及的国家应该专注于鼓励国际和社会支持埃及的民主进程和市场改革。
This depends on the development of a robust civil society, tolerant of open debate, and healthy liberal political parties, as well as active participation by women and an independent media.	这取决于稳健公民社会的发展、对公开争论的包容、健康的自由派政党，以及女性和独立媒体的积极参与。
Winning broad public support will take time.	赢得广泛的公众支持需要时间。
Private non-profit organizations and private enterprise, rather than governments directly, are best equipped to provide this type of training and expertise for leadership development and capacity building.	私人非营利组织和私人企业，而不是各国政府的直接干预，最适于提供此类关于领导力开发和能力建设的培训和专业意见。
The job of democratic governments is to provide the resources that can make delivery of this aid possible.	而个民主国家的政府的职责则是提供让这种援助成为可能的资源。
	
Who Are Tomorrow’s Consumers?	谁是明天的消费者?
SINGAPORE – Luxury-brand companies’ stock prices plunged in July, after their financial results disappointed investors, owing largely to slower sales in emerging markets, especially in China.	发自新加坡 — — 由于在新兴市场（尤其是中国）的销售额走低，财务数据令投资者感到忧虑，奢侈品牌公司的股价在7月大幅下挫。
Meanwhile, news reports indicate that high-end shopping malls in India and China are increasingly empty.	与此同时又有新闻报道指出印度以及中国高端购物中心的人流正不断减少。
What is going on?	究竟发生了什么事？
Many analysts had expected emerging markets to generate exponential growth over the next decade.	许多分析家都预计说新兴市场在未来十年内都将实现指数式的增长。
But now there is talk of how the global crisis is slowing down these economies and killing off discretionary spending.	而今人们谈论的却是全球危机是如何减缓这些经济体发展并扼杀自由支出的。
But a slowdown in China’s economic growth cannot really be blamed for slower sales of luxury goods or empty malls.	然而奢侈品牌或是购物中心门可罗雀可不能归咎于中国经济增长的放缓。
The annual growth rate of China’s $7.5 trillion economy decelerated to 7.6% in the second quarter, from 8.1% in January-March – hardly a cause for panic.	这个7.5万亿经济体的增速从今年第一季度的8.1%下降到第二季度7.6%的表现根本无法引起任何恐慌。
Moreover, two-thirds of the decline is attributable to slower investment rather than slower consumption.	此外，2/3的减速是源自于投资降低而不是消费疲软。
For all of China’s long-term structural problems, it is not exactly slipping into recession.	就中国所有的长期结构性问题看来，它还未滑入衰退。
The real problem is that many analysts had exaggerated the size of the luxury-goods segment in emerging markets.	真正的问题在于许多分析家都夸大了奢侈品牌在新兴市场的销售份额。
China is by far the largest emerging-market economy, with 1.6 million households that can be called “rich” (defined as having annual disposable income of more than $150,000).	目前中国这个最庞大的新兴市场经济体有160万可以被称为“富有”的家庭（界定标准是拥有超过15万美元的年均可支配收入 ） 。
But this is still smaller than Japan’s 4.6 million and a fraction of the 19.2 million rich households in the United States.	但相对于日本的460万来说还是偏低，跟美国的1920万相比更是相形见拙。
The number of rich households amounts to barely 0.7 million in India and one million in Brazil.	而印度和巴西的富裕家庭数量也分别只有80万和100万。
The point is that developed countries still dominate the income bracket that can afford luxury goods.	由此可见，可支付奢侈商品的收入层次中还是以发达国家的人占绝大多数。
The explosive growth recorded by this segment in emerging markets in recent years reflected entry into previously untapped markets, with the subsequent slowdown resulting from saturation.	而近年来新兴市场这部分分额所取得的爆炸式增长则反映了一种进入原本未开发市场的现象，而销售下跌也是由于市场饱和。
The number of high-income households is still growing, but not enough to justify the 30-40% compounded growth rates expected by some.	高收入家庭的数量依然在增长，但不足以支撑某些人所期望的30-40%复合增长率。
This does not mean that growth opportunities in emerging markets have disappeared, but expectations do need to be recalibrated.	这并不意味着新兴市场的增长机会已经消失，而是预期水平必须被重新调整。
Despite the economic boom of the last decade, China still has 164 million households that can be called “poor” (with annual disposable income of less than $5,000) and another 172 million that are “aspirant” (between $5,000-$15,000). Similarly, India has 104 million poor households and 107 million aspirant households.	尽管在过去10年内实现了蓬勃增长，但中国国内依然有1.64亿“贫困”家庭（年均可支配收入低于5000美元）以及1.72亿“积极消费”家庭（年均可支配收入介乎5000到1.5万美元之间 ） ， 而印度的对应数字则分别是1.04亿和1.07亿家庭。
The real story for the next two decades will be these countries’ shift to middle-class status.	而未来20年的真实情况将是这些国家将进入中产状态。
Although other emerging regions will undergo a similar shift, Asia will dominate this transformation.	虽然其他新兴地区都将出现类似的转换，但转型的中心将会是亚洲。
A study by the economist Homi Kharas of the Brookings Institution gives us a sense of the scale of this change.	布鲁金斯学会经济学家荷米·卡拉斯（Homi Kharas）的一项研究向我们展示了这一变革的规模。
He estimates that 18% of the world’s middle class lived in North America in 2009, while another 36% lived in Europe. Asia’s share was 28% (after including Japan).	他首先判断2009年时全球有18%的中产阶级住在北美，另有36%在欧洲，亚洲（计入日本）为28 % 。
But Kharas’s projections suggest that Asia will account for two-thirds of the world’s middle class by 2030.	卡拉斯预计到2030年将全球有2/3的中产阶级住在亚洲。 换句话说。
In other words, Asia will displace not just the West, but even other emerging regions.	亚洲不仅将取代西方，甚至连��他新兴区域也无法望其项背。
This is the real business opportunity.	这才是真正的商业机会。
Of course, the rise of Asia’s middle class is not the only change we should expect.	当然，亚洲中产阶级的崛起并不是我们唯一预期的变革。
We are in the middle of a social and demographic shift that will both destroy and create consumer markets.	我们正处于一个同时会破坏和创造消费者市场的社会和人口结构变革。
The aging of developed markets is well known, but the latest data show that emerging markets are aging at an even faster pace.	发达国家市场的老龄化已经众所周知。 但最新数据显示新兴市场正在更加迅速地经历老龄化。
China’s median age is today 34.5 years, compared to 36.9 years for the US.	中国目前的中间年龄为34.5岁，而美国的数字则是36.9岁。
However, the average Chinese will be 42.5 years old by 2030, compared to 39.1 for the average American. The median Russian will be even older, at 43.3 years.	然而中国人的平均年龄到2030年将达到42.5岁，美国只有39.1岁，俄罗斯则更甚，43.3岁。
The impact of aging is already being felt in these countries’ education systems.	这些国家的教育系统已经遭到了老龄化的冲击。
The number of students enrolled in primary schools in China has fallen by 18% since 1990, and by an astonishing 33% in South Korea.	中国的小学生入学数量自1990年以来已经下降了18 % ， 韩国更是严重下跌了33 % 。
At the other end of the demographic scale, the share of the aged is growing explosively.	在人口结构量表的高龄一端，老年人的份额正出现爆炸性的增长。
Meanwhile, the nature of the basic consuming unit – the household – is also changing rapidly.	与此同时，基本消费单位 — — 家庭 — — 的特性也在迅速改变。
In most developed countries, the traditional nuclear family is in severe decline and is being replaced by single-individual households.	在发达国家，传统的核心家庭（只包括父母和儿女的家庭）数量不断减少，取而代之是单人家庭。
In Germany, for example, 39% of households consist of just one person.	例如在德国，39%的家庭只有一名成员。
Couples with children now account for barely 19% and 22% of households in the United Kingdom and the US, respectively.	有孩家庭仅仅分别占到了英国和美国家庭总量的19%和22 % 。
Nevertheless, it is not all about consumer atomization.	但情况不仅仅是消费者的分散原子化。
We are simultaneously witnessing the re-emergence of the multigenerational extended family, with as many as 22% of American adults in the 25-35 age group living with parents or relatives.	我们同时也见证了几代同堂家庭的重新兴起：在25-35年龄段的美国人中有22%都与父母或者亲戚住在一起。
By contrast, the extended family is giving way in India to nuclear families, which now account for 64% of households.	相比之下，印度的大家庭正在为核心家庭让路，前者目前占全部家庭总数的64 % 。
All of these changes will profoundly affect the future of consumer markets.	所有这些变革将深刻影响消费市场的未来走向。
For example, we need to revise our mental image of the nuclear family from American suburbia to fit the rapidly expanding cities of India.	比如我们需要重新修改原本来自美国郊区的核心家庭形象以使其适应印度迅速发展的各大城市。
By the same token, our mental image of the multigenerational extended family needs to include those in the West.	出于同样原因，我们对大家庭的形象认识也必须包含来自西方的大家庭。
An aging but increasingly middle-class Asia will be at the core of this new consumer landscape.	而一个年龄不断增长且中产阶级不断增长的亚洲将会是新消费者市场的核心。
	
Who Beats Corruption?	谁来打击腐败？
Corruption undermines the quality of life for people around the world, not only in poor countries.	腐败危害全世界人民的生活质量，而不仅仅是穷国。
The US currently is witnessing several corruption scandals.	美国正在经历几个腐败丑闻。
Even America’s Federal Emergency Management Agency, responsible for providing relief after natural disasters and man-made catastrophes, was in the hands of inept political cronies rather than professionals.	甚至是在自然灾害和人为灾难后负责提供援助的美国联邦紧急情况管理局也落于不称职的政治密友之手而非专业人士。
When hurricane Katrina struck America’s Gulf Coast, that incompetence proved fatal.	当卡特琳纳飓风袭击美国海湾沿岸时，这一不称职是致命的。
All societies require an effective government that can provide vital and irreplaceable public services and infrastructure.	所有的社会都要求有效力的政府来向它为之服务的人民提供关键和不可替代的公共服务。
Thus, governments are invested with unique powers, especially the powers of policing and judicial control.	因此，政府被授予独特的权力，特别是维持治安和司法控制的权力。
But these powers are also readily abused.	但是，这些权力同时也经常遭到滥用。
How, then, to ensure that governments are law-abiding as well as strong?	那么，如何来保证政府在强大的同时也守法呢？
The best answer, both in theory and practice, is to find ways to hold governments accountable to the people that they serve.	理论上和实践上最好的办法是寻求使得政府向其服务的人民负责的方法。
Elections are obviously one method, though campaign financing can be a source of corruption.	尽管竞选资助可能成为腐败的源泉，但是，选举明显地是方法之一。
Politicians around the world trade favors for cash needed to win elections, and they often use that cash to buy the votes of desperately poor people.	全世界的政客们都用特殊照顾来换取赢得选举所需要的资金，而且，他们经常用这些资金来买取赤贫人口的选票。
Clear electoral rules and procedures can help ensure transparency, but accountability also comes from the broad society in between elections.	清晰的选举规则和程序可以帮助确保透明，但是，在两次选举当中，广泛的社会阶层也可以产生向选民负责的效果。
Privately owned newspapers, independent radio and television networks, trade unions, churches, professional societies, and other groups within civil society provide a bulwark against despotism.	私人拥有的报纸、独立电台和电视网络、工会、教会、专业团体以及其他公民社会的团体为防止专制主义提供保障。
In the poorest countries, where illiteracy is high, desperate people are subject to government manipulation, and there is a lack of independent control through the media and professional organizations, governments face only weak control by society.	在最贫穷国家，文盲比例很高，绝望的民众受到政府操纵，缺乏通过媒体以及专业组织的独立监督，政府只面对来自社会的微弱的控制。
They tend to be the most despotic and corrupt, not because poor people care less about good governance – on the contrary, their very lives depend on it – but because they lack the means to keep their government disciplined and law abiding.	它们有可能最为专制和腐败，这并不是由于贫苦民众对良好的管制漠不关心（相反，他们的生计取决于此 ） ， 而是由于他们缺乏控制政府并使其守法的手段。
The result is a trap in which poverty causes bad governance and bad governance causes poverty – a two-way spiral downward that can lead to such extreme deprivation that the government, lacking computers, telephones, information systems, and trained civil servants, couldn’t function honestly even if it wanted to.	其结果是这样一个困境：那就是，贫困造成管制混乱，而管制混乱又造成贫困。 这种恶性循环造成极端的窘境，即，由于政府缺乏电脑、电话、信息系统以及训练有素的公务员，即使想要廉洁运作也不可能。
The end result can be collapse into a kind of anarchy, as in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Somalia.	最终结果就是社会崩溃到无政府状态形式，就像利比里亚、塞拉利昂以及索马里那样。
One measure of the quality of governance in over 150 countries is provided by Transparency International, an organization dedicated to strengthening civil society in the fight against government corruption.	透明国际在超过150个国家中提供政府管制质量的衡量标准。 该组织在反对政府腐败的斗争中致力于强化公民社会。
Transparency International produces an annual ranking of “corruption perceptions,” measuring the public’s view of the extent of corruption in a country.	它制作“腐败洞察”的年度排名来衡量公众对某国腐败程度的观点。
In the 2005 rankings, Iceland scored as the least corrupt country, with the Scandinavian countries, New Zealand, and Singapore close behind.	在2005年的排名中，冰岛在最廉洁的国家中名列第一，斯堪的那维亚国家、新西兰以及新加坡紧随其后。
The US ranked seventeenth from the top, a not-so-glorious position for the world’s leading power.	美国排名第七，这对于一个全球统领强国而言并不十分光彩耀人。
In general, the poorer the country, the lower the ranking: tied for last place are Chad and Bangladesh.	总体而言，国家越穷，排名越低。 乍得和孟加拉国并列最末。
A bit of statistical analysis reveals further important patterns.	稍加进一步统计分析就可以揭示更为重要的模式。
First, Sub-Saharan African countries are less corrupt on average than countries at the same income level in other parts of the world.	首先，平均而言，萨哈拉沙漠以南国家与收入水平相同的其他国家相比腐败程度较低。
For example, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali, and Rwanda rank much higher than Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Vietnam. Yet the Asian countries’ economies have tended to grow much faster over the past generation.	例如，布基那法索、加纳、马里以及卢旺达要比孟加拉国、印尼、巴基斯坦和越南排名远远靠前。
Corruption therefore cannot be the unique factor that holds Africa back.	但是，在过去一代人中，亚洲国家的经济发展要远远更快。
Africa’s problems have more to do with droughts, malaria, AIDS, and lack of infrastructure.	非洲的问题更多地与干旱、霍乱、艾滋病以及基础设施缺乏有关。
Poor countries achieve lower levels of corruption when civil rights are protected.	当穷国的民权得到保护时，它们的腐败程度就较低。
When people have the freedom to assemble, to speak, and to publish their views, society benefits not only by increasing the range of ideas that are debated, but also by keeping corruption in check.	当民众有集会、言论以及发表观点的自由时，辩论的观点范围加宽，而且腐败得到抑制，社会因此而受益。
It is no surprise that corrupt regimes routinely clamp down on the press, trade unions, and on professional associations.	因此，腐败定时压制报纸、工会以及专业团体也就不足为奇了。
In Africa, less corrupt countries like Ghana also have much better protection of civil liberties than more corruption-prone countries like Chad and Ethiopia, which are also even poorer.	在非洲，类似加纳 一样的腐败程度较低的国家对公民自由的保护要远远超过像乍得和埃塞俄比亚等更为贫困、更为倾向腐败的国家。
Finally, the data show that corruption is highest in oil and gas-producing countries.	最后，数据显示，石油和天然气生产国家的腐败最为严重。
In general, natural resources like oil, gas, diamonds, and other precious minerals breed corruption, because governments can live off of their export earnings without having to “compromise” with their own societies.	总体而言，由于政府可以依靠出口收入而无需同其社会“妥协 ” ， 因此，类似石油、天然气、钻石以及其他稀有金属的天然资源会促生腐败。
The natural resources are therefore not only a target of corruption but also an instrument of holding power.	所以，自然资源不仅是腐败目标，而且是维护权力的手段。
Many foreign companies, intent on cashing in, fuel the pathology of corrupt regimes by peddling in bribes and political protection.	许多外国公司意在获取利益而通过贿赂和政治保护而加剧腐败当局的病状。
The implications for action are clear.	采取行动的含义是明白无误的。
By strengthening civil society – through legal rights and long-term economic development – and instituting clear rules to ensure accountability, political despotism and corruption will be brought under control.	通过合法权利以及长期经济发展强化公民社会，以及制定清晰的规则来确保政府对人民负责，政治专制和腐败将会得到控制。
We should be uncompromising, therefore, in our defense of civil liberties.	因此，我们要坚定不移地维护公民自由。
The rich world should offer impoverished regions like sub-Saharan Africa more economic support to break out of poverty.	富国应当向类似萨哈拉以南国家的贫穷地区提供更多的经济支持以摆脱贫困。
Of course, aid should be directed to specific needs – for example, malaria control, food production, safe drinking water, and sanitation – whose fulfillment can be measured and monitored to resist corruption.	当然，应当将援助提供给专门的需求，例如，控制霍乱、粮食生产、安全饮用水以及卫生。 可以衡量并监督是否满足这些需求以抵制腐败。
By raising living standards, we would also be empowering both civil society and impoverished governments to defend the rule of law.	通过提高生活水平，我们还将使得公民社会和贫穷的政府能够维护法治。
	
Breaking the WHO’s Glass Ceiling	打破世卫组织的玻璃天花板
TORONTO/NEW YORK – This year, the World Health Organization will elect a new Director-General.	多伦多/纽约—今年，世界卫生组织将选出新的总干事。
Last September, WHO member states nominated six candidates for the position: Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Flavia Bustreo, Philippe Douste-Blazy, David Nabarro, Sania Nishtar, and Miklós Szócska.	去年9月，世卫组织各成员国提名了六位候选人：泰德罗斯·亚德哈诺姆·盖布勒耶瑟斯（Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus ） 、 弗拉维亚·布斯特里奥（Flavia Bustreo ） 、 菲利普·道斯特-布莱奇（Philippe Douste-Blazy ） 、 大卫·纳巴罗（David Nabarro ） 、 萨尼亚·尼什塔尔（Sania Nishtar）和米克洛斯·左斯卡（Miklós Szócska ） 。
On January 25, the WHO Executive Board will shortlist three candidates; and in May, the World Health Assembly will elect one of those candidates to succeed Margaret Chan.	1月25日，世卫组织执行委员会将把候选名单缩减至三位。 5月，世卫组织大会将选出陈冯富珍的继任者。
All of the candidates have presented a vision for how they would lead the organization, and we personally know and admire several of them.	所有这些候选人都提出了一个领导愿景，我们私底下对其中几位候选人也十分了解和敬仰。
But, ultimately, we believe that Ghebreyesus is the most qualified person for the job.	但是，我们还是最相信盖布勒耶瑟斯是最有资格担此大任的人。
Our endorsement is based on three considerations that are important in any hiring process, and especially for a position such as this: the candidate’s past achievements, leadership style, and the diversity that he or she brings to the table.	我们之所以支持他，是出于在任何聘用程序中都至关重要、但对世卫组织总干事这样的职位尤其重要的三个考量：候选者过去的成就、领导风格，及其所能带来的多样性。
With respect to the first consideration, Ghebreyesus has a proven track record of success.	从第一个考量角度看，盖布勒耶瑟斯拥有经过考验的成功记录。
As Ethiopia’s health minister from 2005 to 2012, he championed the interests of all of the country’s citizens, and strengthened primary-care services.	他在2005—2012年担任埃塞俄比亚卫生部长期间着力推进所有埃塞俄比亚人民的利益，强化了该国的基本医疗。
He created 3,500 health centers and 16,000 health posts, and dramatically expanded the health-care workforce by building more medical schools and deploying more 38,000 community-based health extension workers.	他建立了3,500家医疗中心和16,000家医疗站，通过建立更多医学院校和部署38,000多名社区卫生推广工作者极大地扩充了医护工作人员数量。
Ghebreyesus’s efforts now serve as a model that other countries seek to emulate as they try to achieve universal health coverage for their citizens.	如今，盖布勒耶瑟斯的措施已经成为其他国家在试图实现全民医疗覆盖时竞相模仿的对象。
He is the only candidate who has achieved such results at a national level.	他是唯一一个在国家层面实现这些成就的候选人。
Ghebreyesus is also a longtime champion and advocate of gender equality and the rights of women and girls.	盖布勒耶瑟斯也长期致力于推进和支持性别平等和妇女和女孩权利。
In fact, his efforts to strengthen Ethiopia’s health system played a crucial role in more than doubling the percentage of Ethiopian women with access to contraception, and in reducing maternal mortality by 75%.	事实上，他的加强埃塞俄比亚卫生系统的措施令埃塞俄比亚妇女获得避孕手段的比例翻了一番，令产妇死亡率下降了75 % 。
When Ghebreyesus was Ethiopia’s foreign minister from 2012 to 2016, he gained extensive diplomatic experience, not least by leading negotiations for the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, the international community’s plan to finance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.	2012—2016年，盖布勒耶瑟斯担任埃塞俄比亚外交部长，积累了大量外交经验，如领导亚的斯亚贝巴行动日程谈判。 该日程是国际社会对联合国可持续发展目标的融资计划。
This same knack for diplomacy is now needed to bring WHO member states together for cooperative action on collective health challenges.	如今，让世卫组织成员国团结一致采取合作行动应对共同卫生挑战也需要这一外交技巧。
Ghebreyesus’s leadership style is also perfectly suited for this role: he speaks last, and encourages others to share their views.	盖布勒耶瑟斯的领导风格也非常契合世卫组织总干事的角色：他总是最后发言，鼓励其他人分享观点。
He also knows how to spot and nurture talent, and how to bring the best out of the people around him.	他还知道如何发现和培养人才，如何让周围的人人尽其用。
He would undoubtedly boost organizational morale and motivate the staff to deliver maximum value and efficiency – to the benefit of all member states and their citizens.	他将毫无疑问地提高世卫组织的士气和世卫组织工作人员实现最大价值和效率的动力 — — 为了所有成员国和它们的人民的利益。
And while he is a receptive listener, he is also decisive, which is an attribute for the leader of the world’s foremost health institution, especially during global public-health emergencies.	除了是一位优秀的聆听者，他也具有决断力，而这正是领导世界上最重要的卫生机构所必须的特质之一，尤其是在发生全球公共卫生紧急情况时。
Then there is Ghebreyesus’s extensive leadership experience within global health institutions.	盖布勒耶瑟斯还具有丰富的全球卫生机构领导静研。
As Board Chair of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria between 2009 and 2011, and as Chair of the Roll Back Malaria Partnership between 2007 and 2009, Ghebreyesus pushed through sweeping changes that dramatically improved both organizations’ operations.	2009—2011年，他担任全球对抗艾滋病、结核病和疟疾基金理事会主席；2007—2009年，他担任对抗疟疾伙伴合作计划（Roll Back Malaria Partnership）主席，其间他带来了令人耳目一新的变化，大大改善了这两个卫生组织的运营情况。
What’s more, he helped them raise record-breaking financial commitments from donors: $11.7 billion for the Global Fund, and $3 billion for Roll Back Malaria.	此外，他还帮助它们从出资者那里筹集到创纪录的融资承诺：全球基金获得117亿美元，抗疟疾计划获得30亿美元。
This is precisely the kind experience and expertise that the WHO needs in today’s global health environment, and it explains why the African Union has officially endorsed Ghebreyesus’s candidacy.	这正是世卫组织在当今全球卫生环境中所需要的经验和专业，也解释了为何非盟官方支持他的候选人资格。
Amazingly, in its almost 70-year history, the WHO has never had a Director-General from Africa.	有趣的是，在其近70年的历史上，世卫组织从未有过来自非洲的总干事。
This fact alone is not a reason to pick a candidate; but in Ghebreyesus’s case, his direct experience working in developing countries makes him uniquely qualified to tackle our toughest global health problems, which tend to hit developing countries the hardest.	这一事实本身就构成了选一位非洲总干事的理由；但在盖布勒耶瑟斯的例子中，他在发展中国家的直接工作经验让他具备了应对最棘手的全球卫生问题（受影响最严重的往往是发展中国家）的独一无二的资质。
It is time to break the WHO’s African-leadership glass ceiling.	世卫组织应该打破非洲领导人的玻璃天花板。
Sustainable development is truly achievable only when leaders of global institutions are from the communities most affected by those institutions’ work.	只有当全球机构领导人来自受该机构的工作影响最大的地区时，可持续发展才有可能真正实现。
Ghebreyesus’s candidacy presents the WHO with an historic opportunity, which its Executive Board should seize on January 25.	盖布勒耶瑟斯成为候选人是世卫组织的一次历史性机遇，其执行委员会应该在1月25日抓住这次机会。
	
Who is Gordon Brown?	布朗的真面目
At long last, Gordon Brown is taking over from Tony Blair as Britain’s Prime Minister, thus attaining his life-long ambition, as if by right.	最终，布朗从布莱尔手中接任英国首相一职，因而好像理所当然地实现了其终身的雄心。
That is his first problem.	这是他的第一个问题。
He has not been elected by anyone – not by the Labour Party, and not by Britain’s voters; he has merely come into an inheritance that he has long thought was his due.	他并非经过选举上任，即不是工党，也不是英国选民。 他只不过是继承了他长久以来认为本应是他的东西。
How, then, will Brown acquire legitimacy as Britain’s new leader?	那么，布朗将会如何获得作为英国新领导人的合法性呢？
The one thing that is clear is that he will not gain legitimacy if he offers only more of what Blair has been dishing up for the past ten years.	现在唯一清楚的事情就是，如果他仅仅重蹈布莱尔过去十年中的复辙，那么他就不会获得合法性。
Brown’s second problem is the mirror image of the first.	布朗的第二个问题是第一个问题的翻版。
As a senior member of Blair’s government throughout its tenure, he shares responsibility for everything that Blair has done.	作为整个布莱尔政府任期内的重要成员，布朗要对布莱尔的所作所为分担责任。
Political commentators sometimes claim to detect important differences in their underlying political attitudes.	政治评论家们有时宣称他们二人的基本政治态度存在重要分歧。
However, in practice, Brown has remained in the shadows, skillfully managing the economy, but remaining silent and enigmatic on vital political issues, and apparently endorsing everything Blair did.	但是实际上，布朗一直躲在幕后，娴熟地管理着经济，但是在重大政治问题上保持缄默和深不可测，而且明显地支持布莱尔所做的所有事情。
If Brown is to gain legitimacy, he must offer something new; but he can do that only by distinguishing himself from the Blair legacy in clearly perceptible – and therefore fairly radical – ways.	如果布朗要获得合法性，他就必须有所新意。 但是，他只有通过以显而易见、进而激进的方式来把他自己同布莱尔留下的东西分道扬镳才能做到这一点。
This will be a difficult trick to pull off.	这绝非易事。
Perhaps the single most important domestic question Brown faces concerns where he stands on the balance between the free market and the claims of social policy.	布朗面临的最重要的国内问题可能是在自由市场和社会政策平衡问题上的立场。
Blair’s government moved the Labour Party a long way to the right of its traditional priorities of protecting the underprivileged, and to justify the change he re-named the party “New Labour.”	布莱尔政府将工党大大地拉向了保护弱势群体的传统重点的右翼，从而为布莱尔给工党重新民名为“新工党”提供改变的理由。
In many ways, the Blair government’s support of free-market policies turned out to be a shrewd and productive shift.	在许多方面，布莱尔政府支持自由市场政策是精明而又有成果的转变。
Britain’s economy grew more steadily and rapidly than it had done for several generations, and the tax revenue generated by growth enabled the government to pour money into education and the National Health Service.	与过去几十年相比，英国经济增长更为稳健和快速，而由经济增长所带来的税收收入使得政府能够把钱投入到教育和全国医疗系统上。
But this has come at a price, or rather several prices.	但是这些都是有代价的，甚至是沉重的代价。
First, inequality has grown at both ends of the income scale.	首先，不平等在收入等级的两端都扩大了。
At the bottom, the proportion of the population with an income below the poverty line increased from 13% at the start of Blair’s government to 20% now.	在最低端，收入在贫困线以下的人口比例从布莱尔政府伊始的13％增加到现在的20 ％ 。
That situation is much worse among ethnic minorities.	在少数族裔人口中这一情况更为糟糕。
And, despite the government’s efforts, childhood poverty also has increased under Blair.	而且，尽管政府作出了努力，儿童贫困在布莱尔时期也增加了。
At the top, the incomes of the mega-rich have soared, with predictable repercussions, especially in the property market.	在最顶端，超级巨富的收入大幅上扬，其结果是可想而知的，特别是在房地产市场上。
Public concern about this issue has been made much worse by claims that the rich get even richer by paying little tax.	有人说富人纳税很少从而越发富有，因此有关这一问题的公共关切越发严重。
There was a time when Brown was thought to be a believer in traditional Labour Party values.	布朗一度被认为是传统工党价值观的真正信仰者。
Was it true?	果真如此吗？
Is it true now?	现在是否还是如此呢？
What will he say about inequality?	他对不平等会作何表态呢？
Unfortunately, Blair and his government are perceived to be tainted by some of the less attractive features of free-market capitalism.	不幸的是，人们认为布莱尔及其政府由于自由市场资本主义的某些并不吸引人的特点所玷污。
Blair himself seems to prefer to have “friends” who are very rich and who will lend him their holiday villas in Tuscany.	布莱尔本人看起来宁愿与某些十分富有、并且会把在意大利图斯卡尼的度假别墅借给他使用的“朋友”交往。
This “closeness” has led the police to investigate claims that some Labour Party donors have been rewarded with political honors.	这一“紧密联系”让警方调查有关某些工党的捐助者获得了政治荣誉的指控。
In short, Blair’s government exudes an aura of sleaze and cronyism.	简而言之，布莱尔政府流露出的是龌龊和任人唯亲。
Can Brown show that he is different?	布朗能够表明他有所不同吗？
The worst part of Blair’s legacy, of course, is the war in Iraq.	当然，布莱尔留给世人的最为糟糕的东西就是伊拉克战争。
Many people predicted, and everyone can now see, that the decision to invade was a disastrous error; that it is having catastrophic consequences, not just for Iraq, but also for the Middle East generally; and that it has seriously damaged the moral standing of the United States and Britain.	许多人预计，而且现在每个人都可以看到，入侵伊拉克的决定是一个灾难性的错误。 不仅仅对伊拉克产生了灾难性的后果，而且对整个中东地区也是如此。
The most critical issue facing Brown is whether he chooses to distance himself from Blair’s self-satisfied and delusional claim that the invasion of Iraq was “the right thing to do.”	这一战争严重地损害了美国和英国的道德地位。 布朗面临的最为重大的问题就是他是否与布莱尔自我满足以及错觉般宣称入侵伊拉克是“正确的事情”拉开距离。
Britain has already reduced its forces in southern Iraq, and is on course to reduce them still further as they hand over “security” to the Iraqi police and military.	英国已经减少了在伊拉克南部的兵力，而且将要在把“治安”交给伊拉克警察和军队的时候继续进一步削减。
In reality, of course, the civil and guerrilla war under way in the rest of Iraq means that any security in the south can only be a temporary illusion.	当然，实际上，在伊拉克其他地方进行的内战和游击战意味着南部的治安只能是一个暂时幻觉。
The choice facing Brown is whether to cling silently to the existing policy, in the futile hope that the problem will go away, or explicitly recognize Britain’s share in the disaster.	布朗面临的选择是，是否默默地坚持现行政策并且徒然地希望问题会消失，还是明确承认英国在这一灾难中应有的责任。
This is partly a question of what to do now in Iraq; but it is also a question of Britain’s relationship with the US.	这部分也是目前伊拉克政策问题。 但是这也是英国与美国关系的问题。
With hindsight, it is clear that Britain’s participation in the Iraq war was driven solely by Blair’s determination to stick limpet-like to the US.	从事后来看，很明显，英国参加伊拉克战争完全是由于布莱尔决心为美国的马首是瞻所驱使。
Brown believes, and has said, that Britain must always be close friends with America; and obviously that is the right thing to believe and say.	布朗相信，而且也说过，英国必须始终是美国的紧密朋友。 很明显，这样相信和说话是正确的。
But is he prepared to make clear that there is a difference between being close friends and going into an illegal and disastrous war just to please George W Bush?	但是，他是否准备表明，紧密朋友和仅仅为了取悦布什而发动非法和灾难性的战争是有区别的呢？
So far, there is no indication that he will.	目前，没有迹象表明他会这样做。
While he has publicly regretted the errors in British intelligence about Saddam Hussein, that is merely a way of shifting the blame from the government to the intelligence services.	尽管他公开地对英国情报机关有关萨达姆的情报错误表示遗憾，这只不过是将责难从政府推卸到了情报机构头上。
But it was not the intelligence services that decided to go to war; it was Tony Blair, with the support of Gordon Brown.	但是并不是情报机构决定发动战争的。 决定是由布莱尔在布朗的支持下做出的。
	
Who is to Blame?	谁之罪？
PRINCETON – Now that the economic crisis looks less threatening (at least for the moment), and forecasters are spying “green shoots” of recovery, an ever more encompassing blame game is unfolding.	普林斯顿 — — 这场经济危机看起来已经没那么危险了（至少眼下是这样 ） ， 预测人士纷纷开始搜索复苏的“绿芽 ” ， 与此同时，一场范围空前的问责游戏也轰轰烈烈地展开了。
The financial crisis provides an apparently endless opportunity for unmasking deceit, malfeasance, and corruption.	显然，金融危机提供了用之不竭的机会，可以揭露欺诈、渎职和腐败。
But we are not sure quite who and what should be unmasked.	然而，究竟应该揭露谁，揭露什么，我们倒有些吃不准了。
Leading bankers were initially the most obvious culprits.	大银行家首当其冲，成了最显眼的被告。
They presided over institutions that made large profits for a substantial period of time by mispricing risk, and then argued for public support on the grounds that they were too big to fail.	长期以来，他们掌管的金融机构靠着扭曲风险定价赚得盆满钵满，回过头来又振振有词地要求公众出资救助，理由是这些机构太大，倒不得。
They appeared arrogant and overpaid, and were easily demonized.	他们表现得趾高气扬，收入似乎高得离谱，很容易就被妖魔化。
But what about the political process?	但政治程序又如何呢？
Why were the banks not more closely controlled and better regulated?	为什么这些银行没有受到更密切的监控和更完善的规管？
It is not that politicians were “bought” in a simple sense; rather, they convinced themselves that financial innovation opened the gate to greater general prosperity, increased home ownership, and, of course, popular support in elections.	这不是某些政客被“收买”了那么简单，毋宁说，政客们使自己相信，金融创新开启了普遍繁荣之门，提高了房屋所有者的比例，当然，也就提高了选举中的民众支持率。
Governments are now vulnerable, and politicians are under attack almost everywhere.	各国政府眼下如履薄冰，政客们差不多成了过街老鼠。
Administrations have collapsed in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Iceland, and Ireland.	捷克、匈牙利、冰岛和爱尔兰的行政当局已然崩溃。
Riots and paralyzing strikes have crippled Thailand, France, and Greece.	泰国、法国和希腊被暴乱和罢工折腾得半身不遂。
In Kuwait, the government dismissed parliament.	科威特政府解散了议会。
Britain is convulsed by a scandal about parliamentary expenses that has no equivalent since the attacks on “old corruption” in the early nineteenth century.	英国则因为议员骗领津贴丑闻闹翻了天 — — 自打19世纪上半叶声讨“陋规 ” （ old corruption）以来，英国还没出过这么大的腐败丑闻。
Recriminations after financial crises have a long history, and they recur in regular cycles.	金融危机一过秋后算账的现象有很长的历史了，它们循着规律性的周期一再出现。
The stock exchange boom of the early 1870’s was followed by collapse in 1873 and a witch-hunt for those responsible.	19世纪70年代初的股市泡沫导致1873年的崩盘，也引发了对相关责任者的“围剿 ” 。
In 1907, J.P. Morgan was first viewed as the savior of the market, and then as the enemy of the commonweal.	1907年大恐慌期间，J.P. 摩根先是被看作市场救星，最后却沦为全民公敌。
In the 1930’s, bankers and finance ministers were accused.	20世纪30年代，银行家和财政部长们则成为众矢之的。
But for the rest of the twentieth century, the backlash cycle seemed to have stopped.	不过在20世纪的其余时间里，这种反冲循环似乎已不再上演。
Today the attacks are not limited to the political and financial establishment.	时至今日，受攻击的不仅是政治和金融大佬们。
Critics are trying to identify the ideas as well as the interests that were responsible for financial and economic dysfunction.	批评者试图挖掘出导致金融和经济失调的一些错误理念和既得利益。
In this respect, the contemporary crisis is unlike the historical analogies, in that it looks as if financial innovation was driven by a set of intellectual and even technological innovations.	在这方面，我们这场危机被挖出来的根子同历史上的危机都不一样 — — 看起来，金融创新背后的驱动力是一系列学术乃至技术革新。
Since it is an economic crisis, most people seeking its intellectual roots are tempted to begin with economists, who, with a few exceptions, look particularly discredited.	由于它是一场经济危机，多数人都不自觉地从经济学家那儿开始挖它的学术根子。 除了一些例外，经济学家的公信力大打折扣。
The founder of the rational expectations revolution, Robert Lucas, is endlessly quoted as having stated in 2003 in his presidential address to the American Economic Association that the “central problem of depression-prevention has been solved, for all practical purposes, and has in fact been solved for many decades.”	人们无休止地引用理性预期革命的奠基人罗伯特·卢卡斯（Robert Lucas）2003年在美国经济学学会主席就职演说里讲的一段话 ： “ 预防萧条的核心课题已经得到解决，已经可以满足实践上的一切需要，而且实际上已经解决了好几十年 。 ”
It is also clear that academic economists had an impact on policy.	学院经济学家能够影响政策，这一点也很清楚。
Larry Summers, now the highly influential director of President Barack Obama’s National Economic Council, concluded as a young economist that “financial and monetary shocks are less important sources of depression than we had suspected.”	目前身居贝拉克·奥巴马总统国家经济委员会主席这一极富影响力之要职的拉里·萨默斯（Larry Summers）年轻的时候曾经断言 ： “ 金融和货币冲击在引发萧条方面的重要性被我们高估了 。 ”
If the economy was foolproof, and if so many good policy options existed to deal with crisis and distress, there was less need to avoid mistakes.	如果经济简单得连傻瓜都懂，如果对付危机和困难有那么多好的政策选项，也就不需要避免什么错误了。
Things could always be set right retrospectively.	毕竟，事后诸葛亮总是容易的。
Other academic disciplines have looked rather smugly at the public humiliation of their colleagues in economics.	当公众鄙夷经济学家的时候，其他学科颇有些幸灾乐祸。
The non-mathematical appear to have their revenge, as the perils of over-reliance on complex symbolic notation and arcane formulae are relentlessly exposed.	非定量学科似乎有了个扬眉吐气的机会 — — 过度依赖复杂符号和晦涩公式的危险这回算是暴露无遗。
In fact, developments or fashions in other academic disciplines and also in the general culture contributed at least as much to a willingness to engage in absurd risks and to provide and accept valuations of complex and inherently unfathomable securities.	可实际上，鼓励人们去荒唐冒险，去制造和接受高度复杂、根本看不懂的证券定价的，不仅仅是经济学家；其他学术领域乃至一般文化领域里的发展和时尚也难辞其咎。
The general cultural developments are sometimes termed post-modernism, which involves the replacement of reason by intuition, feeling, and allusion.	一般文化领域近年来的种种趋势有时被称为后现代主义，其内涵包括以直觉、感受和隐喻取代理性认知的倾向。
But post-modernism has itself been generated by technology, with which it has a deeply ambiguous relationship.	然而，后现代主义本身就源自技术革命，它同后者的纠葛剪不断理还乱。
In contrast to a steam engine or an old-fashioned automobile, whose operations were easily comprehensible, modern automobiles or airplanes are so complicated that their operators have no idea how the technology they are using actually works.	蒸汽机或老式汽车的工作原理一目了然，而现代的汽车飞机如此复杂，以至于这些高科技产品的操纵者对其实际工作���理毫无概念。
The Internet has created a world in which strict logic is less important than the juxtaposition of striking images.	互联网创造了一个虚拟世界，在这个虚拟世界里，严格的逻辑已不那么重要，大行其道的是错综杂陈的酷炫图像。
Post-modernism moves away from the rational culture of the so-called “modern era.”	后现代主义跳出了所谓“摩登时代”的理性文化。
Many people are finding more analogies with medieval life, in which humans were surrounded by processes that they found difficult to comprehend. As a result, they thought they lived in a world populated by demons and mysterious forces.	不少人觉得它更像中世纪的生活图景 — — 人类被种种晦涩难解的现象包围着，于是自认为生活在一个充斥神魔和灵力的世界里。
The recent era of global finance – perhaps we should speak of it as being past? – differed from the financial surge of a century ago.	全球金融的最近时代 — — 也许我们该叫它“正在逝去的时代 ” ？ — — 不同于一个世纪之前的金融浪潮。
Its cultural manifestations also appeared to be novel.	其文化表现也是前无古人的。
It was playful, allusive, and edgy – in short, post-modern.	它玩世不恭，言辞闪烁，喜欢游走于边缘地带 — — 一句话，整个就是一后现代。
It treated tradition and history not as a constraint, but as a source of ironic reference.	在它眼里，传统和历史与其说是威严的训诫，不如说是讥讽的对象。
At the era’s height, major financial players built vastly expensive collections of highly abstract modern art.	在这个时代玩得最high的时候，金融玩家们也在挥金如土地收藏极度抽象的现代艺术品。
A post-modern neglect or disdain for reality generated the sense that the whole world was constantly shifting and malleable, and might be as transient and meaningless as stock quotations.	对现实性的一种后现代式的无视或轻慢造成一种感觉：整个世界分分秒秒都在流变，时而可以捶扁搓圆随心所欲，时而又像股价一样倏忽无常毫无意义。
An alliance was formed between financial experts who thought they were selling truly innovative ideas, a political elite that endorsed the philosophy of “regulation lite,” and a cultural climate that pushed experimentation and the rejection of traditional values.	一个同盟就此结成，一边是自以为在兜售绝顶创意的金融高手，一边是推崇“无为规管”哲学的政治精英，还有一边则是热衷于尝新、对传统价值弃之如敝屐的文化气候。
The result was that every sort of value – including financial values – came to be seen as arbitrary and fundamentally absurd.	结果，一切价值 — — 包括金融业的传统价值 — — 都被看作是僵硬武断、顽固不化，因而也就是骨子里的谬论。
When incomprehension no longer produces new heights of prosperity, but rather economic collapse and failure, it is not surprising that it turns to anger.	当无厘头再也无法推高繁荣的泡沫，当经济崩溃铺天盖地袭来，毫不奇怪，这个狂欢同盟也就一下子从狂喜转为狂怒。
Finding out who is to blame becomes more and more like the late medieval and early modern search for witches: a way of making sense of a disorderly and hostile universe.	寻找谴责对象的做法也变得越来越像中世纪后期和现代早期那种迫害女巫的勾当：在一个失序和充满敌意的世界里，这是一种强求意义的方式。
	
Who Lost Turkey?	谁丢失了土耳其？
PARIS – “Who lost Turkey?”	巴黎 - “ 谁丢失了土耳其 ？ ”
That question, often raised in the past, has been heating up in the aftermath of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s emotional outburst during the recent World Economic Forum 2009 in Davos, when he abruptly left a panel he was sharing with Israeli President Shimon Peres.	这个经常在过去被提起的问题，在土耳其总理雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安最近在2009年达沃斯世界经济论坛上情绪爆发事件后，变得越来越热门了-在会议期间，在与以色列总统西蒙佩雷斯同一个讨论小组上，他突然离去。
And the Turkish question matters greatly, because it touches on some of the most unstable and unsettling of the world’s diplomatic disputes.	土耳其的问题事关重大，因为它涉及到世界上外交争端中一些最不稳定和最令人担心的部分。
If Turkey has indeed been “lost,” those responsible include the European Union, the United States, Israel, and Turkey itself.	如果土耳其确实已经“被丢失 ” ， 要对此负责的方面包括欧盟、美国、以色列和土耳其本身。
The EU’s growing reservations about Turkey’s membership have been expressed unambiguously by French President Nicolas Sarkozy.	欧盟对土耳其加入欧盟所持的越来越保留的态度已由法国总统萨科齐明确地表达了。
In the US, former President George W. Bush gets some of the blame because of the war in Iraq.	美国方面，前总统布什也因为伊拉克战争而要对此负一定责任。
Israel, too, has played its part in Turkey’s alienation from the West, as a result of the Lebanon war of 2006 and its recent military operations in Gaza.	以色列也由于2006年的黎巴嫩战争和最近在加沙的军事行动，在土耳其疏远西方一事上起了它的作用。
All of these events have disturbed and disoriented Turkey, and are magnified by the domestic impact of worst global economic crisis since the 1930’s.	所有这些事件都让土耳其感到不安和无所适从，这些事件并因20世纪30年代以来最严重的全球性经济危机对国内的影响而被放大。
Of course, Turkey’s secular, pro-Western elites may still consider the EU and the US important, if not indispensable, allies and partners, and they may consider Islamic fundamentalism, Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran real or at least potential threats.	当然，土耳其的非宗教的亲西方精英们可能仍然认为欧盟和美国是重要的（如非必不可少的）盟友和伙伴。 他们可能会视伊斯兰原教旨主义、哈马斯、真主党和伊朗为真正的或至少是潜在的威胁。
Yet they are also convinced that Europe has behaved improperly toward Turkey, through a combination of short-term populist reflexes and the absence of a long-term strategic vision.	然而，他们也认定由于欧洲的短视的民粹主义反应加上缺乏长远的战略眼光，欧洲对土耳其的所作所为是欠妥的。
The Turkish question is, of course, complex.	当然，土耳其的问题是复杂的。
Turkey’s geography is predominantly Asian, Turkey’s emotions are increasingly Middle Eastern, i.e., Muslim on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and yet Turkey’s elites remain resolutely pro-Western and pro-European.	土耳其的地理位置主要是在亚洲，土耳其的情绪色彩越来越中东化-即在以色列和巴勒斯坦冲突上持穆斯林的情绪，但土耳其的精英们仍然坚定地亲西方和亲欧洲。
But for how long?	但这种情况会持续多久呢？
At the beginning of the twenty-first century, when dialogue with the Islamic world is one of the Western world’s key challenges, Europe would commit a historic strategic blunder if it were to close its doors to Turkey.	在这21世纪初，与伊斯兰世界展开对话是西方世界面临的主要挑战之一，在这个时候，如果欧洲要对土耳其关上大门，那么它将铸成一个历史性的战略错误。
To do so would push back the inheritors of the Ottoman Empire back onto an Asian, Muslim, and Middle Eastern historical trajectory.	这样做会把奥斯曼帝国的后裔们推回到亚洲、穆斯林和中东的历史轨道中去。
In the question of Turkish accession to the EU, the journey matters more than the destination.	在土耳其加入欧盟的问题上，其过程比目的更为重要。
The reforms that Turkey has already implemented in a very short period of time, thanks to its EU candidate status, are impressive.	由于其加入欧盟的候选国地位，土耳其已经在很短的时间内进行了改革，这令人印象深刻。
Should we in Europe really put at risk that progress by expressing an all-too-audible “no”?	难道我们在欧洲真的要大声说“不”而让这样的进程处于危境中吗？
The EU desperately needs a strategic and diplomatic partner that can significantly reinforce its clout in the Middle East.	欧盟迫切需要一个可大大增强其在中东影响力的战略和外交伙伴。
Europe also needs the dynamism of a youthful Turkey.	欧洲也需要年轻的土耳其的活力。
Above all, it needs the message of reconciliation sent to Islam that Turkey’s entrance into the Union would represent.	最重要的是，它需要把和解的信息发送到伊斯兰世界中，而土耳其加入欧盟将代表了这个信息。
Of course, to want Turkey “in” is an act of will, if not an act of faith that is in many ways counterintuitive.	当然，希望土耳其 “入盟”是意志所导致的行为，若不是说在许多方面是违反直觉的信念所导致的行为。
Most Europeans do not perceive Turkey as a “European Other” but as a “non-European Other.”	大多数欧洲人不把土耳其视为“欧洲的那部分 ” ， 而视为“非欧洲的那部分 ” 。
Even in Istanbul, the most Westernized of Turkish cities, as soon as one leaves the main arteries, one seems to be immersed in a Middle Eastern or Asian culture.	即使在土耳其最西化的城市伊斯坦布尔，只要一离开主干道，你似乎是沉浸在中东或亚洲文化中。
Israel is not in the European Union, but it, too, is in great danger of losing Turkey.	以色列不属于欧盟，但失去土耳其也会对它造成威胁。
Far from reinforcing Israel’s security, its last two military adventures, in Lebanon and now in Gaza, have caused further self-isolation and loss of world sympathy.	其过去两年在黎巴嫩和目前在加沙地带的军事冒险，根本没有巩固以色列的安全，而是造成了进一步的自我孤立并失去了世界的同情。
Nowhere has this phenomenon been stronger than in Turkey, where those military escapades have strained the two countries’ strategic alliance almost to the breaking point.	在土耳其，这个现象没有比其它地方更强的了，那些军事冒险使得两国的战略联盟几乎紧张到了崩裂的低点。
It is too early to speak of Obama’s policy towards Turkey; suffice it to say that in his willingness to open a respectful dialogue with Islam, he is the only Western leader to move in the right direction.	现在来谈论奥巴马对土耳其的政策还为时太早;我只想说，他现在愿意以尊重的态度打开与伊斯兰世界的对话，他就是唯一的朝正确的方向迈进的西方领导人。
But can positive American gestures towards Turkey, a key NATO member, be sufficient to offset Israel’s insensitive, if not reckless, policies?	但是，美国对土耳其这一北约重要的成员国的积极姿态，能足以抵消以色列采取的不够敏感（若非鲁莽的）的政策吗？
The answer is unclear.	答案还不清楚。
Turkey, too shares some of the responsibility for this mounting process of estrangement. Erdogan’s behavior in Davos was, at the very least, irresponsible.	土耳其，也要为这个越来越严重的分裂过程负部分责任。 埃尔多安在达沃斯的行为至少是不负责任的。
He may have gained popularity back home, but in today’s difficult economic times, the temptations of cheap populism are more dangerous than ever.	他可能在国内是得到了一些民意支持，但在今天的经济困难时期，廉价的民粹主义的诱惑比以往任何时候都更危险。
One does not play lightly with matches next to a pile of dry wood.	我们不能在火柴放在一堆干材旁边的时候掉以轻心。
	
Who Needs a Flat Tax?	谁需要统一税率？
WASHINGTON, DC – With America’s Republican presidential candidates lining up to declare their fealty to a flat tax – a system of personal-income taxation that assesses a single rate for all – opponents have focused on why it is a bad idea to raise taxes on the poor in order to reduce them for the wealthy.	华盛顿特区 — — 统一税率体系是对所有纳税者实行单一税率的个人所得税体系，美国共和党总统候选人异口同声地支持统一税率，而反对者则喋喋不休地强调为什么为了给富人减税而给穷人增税是个坏主意。
But, if a flat tax is such a bad idea, why have so many countries embraced it?	但如果统一税率真的那么糟糕，为什么还有那么多国家实行统一税率？
A careful study of these countries – mainly post-communist countries in Eastern Europe and a smattering of tiny micro-states worldwide – suggests that there are three main reasons.	仔细研究就会发现，主要是东欧的后共产主义国家和世界各地的小国采用统一税率。 主要有三种理由促使它们这么做。
First, some countries are so relatively poor and lacking in domestic capital that they opt to drop rates in order to attract foreign investors.	首先，有些国家太过贫困并且缺乏国内资金，它们选择降低税率吸引外国投资。
Other countries are so small and ineffective at collecting revenue that they cannot afford a progressive tax system.	还有些国家太小、税收效率太低，担负不起累进制税率。
Finally, some countries are so corrupt that they have to offer the wealthy a huge rate cut to get them to pay any taxes at all.	最后，有些国家太过腐败，需要大幅度降低富人的税率才能让他们交税。
The United States, like other developed countries, does not suffer from any of these conditions (yet), so it is not clear why it needs a flat tax.	美国和其他发达国家一样（尚）不存在上面提到的问题，因此不清楚为什么要实行统一税率。
The formerly communist countries of Eastern Europe that have adopted a flat tax – including Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Romania, Slovakia, and Ukraine, among others – sorely lack investment capital.	东欧实行统一税率的前共产主义国家 — — 包括保加利亚、捷克共和国、爱沙尼亚、拉脱维亚、立陶宛、马其顿、罗马尼亚、斯洛伐克和乌克兰在内 — — 都严重缺乏投资资金。
Whether on the European Union’s doorstep or just inside, they compete for the attention of foreign direct investors, for whom a flat tax provides an important signal: You are welcome, we will not steal your money, and you can keep what you earn.	上述有些国家刚刚加入欧盟，有些正争取加入，但它们都千方百计地吸引国外直接投资者的注意，而统一税率发出了一个重要的信号：欢迎你们来投资，我们不会拿走你们的钱，你们所挣的钱都归你们自己。
For developed countries that already have capital and a track record of inward investment, “the appeal of the flat tax is consequently less,” as a report by the International Monetary Fund concludes.	国际货币基金组织的一份报告显示，对已有资金及国内投资记录的发达国家而言 ， “ 统一税率并没有那么大吸引力 ” 。
Thus, the flat tax has not been adopted in any developed countries, or in China.	因此，发达国家和中国都没有采用统一税制。
The other countries that have embraced a flat tax are small or micro-states: Jamaica, Tuvalu, Grenada, Mauritius, Timor-Leste, Belize, and Seychelles.	实行统一税率的其他国家均属小型及微型之列：牙买加、图瓦卢、格林纳达、毛里求斯、东帝汶、伯利兹和塞舌尔。
The only (partial) exception to this rule is Paraguay, which adopted a flat tax in 2010.	唯一（部分）打破这项定律的是巴拉圭，该国从2010年开始实行统一税率。
Here, flat-tax advocates’ administrative-simplicity arguments have some traction.	这里，统一税率所宣扬的行政简化有一定道理。
If a country is so small that it cannot develop a tax administration effective enough to manage a fair system of progressive taxation, then a flat tax may make sense.	如果国家面积太小无法制定有效的税收征管机制来监管公平的累进制税率，那么就有理由实行统一税率。
Moreover, some small countries have other sources of revenue, so the benefit of implementing a progressive tax system does not justify the cost.	此外，有些小国有其他收入来源，因此实行累进制税率的好处与所付出的代价不成正比。
Tuvalu’s government, for example, derives nearly 10% of its revenues from the sale of rights to its “.tv” Internet domain name, which brings in about $2 million annually.	比方说图瓦卢政府10%的收入来自其 “ . tv”互联网域名的销售，仅此一项每年即可获得约200万美元的收入。
Countries that are just slightly larger can afford to collect income taxes in a fairer way.	稍大一些的国家就能承受以更公平的方式征收所得税。
Finally, if a country’s public institutions are in the thrall of oligarchs who are accustomed to stealing with impunity from the public till, a flat tax may be the only way to induce the wealthy to pay any tax at all.	最后，如果一个国家的公共机构深受寡头影响而惯于肆无忌惮地盗窃公共财物，诱使富人纳税的唯一办法可能就是实行统一税率。
Thus, in 2001 Russia became the first large state to adopt a flat tax, reducing the top marginal rate from 30% to 13%.	因此在2001年，俄国成为实行统一税率的唯一一个大国，最高边际税率从30%降至13 % 。
In 2003, Ukraine dropped its top rate from 40% to 13%.	2003年，乌克兰将最高税率从40%降至13 % 。
In nearly all countries that have introduced a flat tax, government revenues from income tax have declined.	几乎在所有实行统一税率的国家，政府的所得税收入都有所降低。
That is why its adoption is often associated with an increase in value-added tax rates (as has occurred throughout Eastern Europe).	这也解释了为什么在实行统一税率的同时往往会调高增值税率（几乎所有东欧国家都是如此 ） 。
In the US, the Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain’s “9-9-9” plan calls for a 9% rate for personal and corporate taxes, together with a new 9% national sales tax.	美国共和党总统候选人赫尔曼·凯恩的“999”计划呼吁在实行9%的个人及企业税率的同时，实行9%的国家销售税率。
A country’s tax system reflects its institutional capacity, economic circumstances, and distribution of political power.	一个国家的税制状况反应其体制能力、经济状况和政治权力分配。
If the US were to become the first developed country to experiment with a flat tax, that shift would tend to confirm what many suspect but hope is not true: that America is broke, desperate for inward investment, incompetently governed, and increasingly ruled by a self-regarding oligarchic elite.	如果美国真的成为试行统一税率的首个发达国家，只会确认很多人希望不要成为现实的怀疑：美国已经破产，急需外来投资，政府管理不善，执政权越来越多地落到自以为是的寡头精英们手里。
	
Who Needs the Humanities?	谁需要人文学科？
WARWICK, UK – Nowadays, in country after country, policymakers have become obsessed with the need to strengthen science education.	英国，华威－现在，一个国家接着一个国家，政策制定者们都沉迷于需要加强自然科学教育的观点。
But what about the humanities – all those disciplines (literature, history, languages, and so forth) whose relevance to economic competitiveness is not so obvious?	但是，人文学科－所有这些和经济竞争关系不是那么明显的学科（文学，历史，语言等等 ） , 又怎么样呢？
We need the humanities only if we are committed to the idea of humanity.	我们只有在我们忠于人性的观点的时候我们才需要人文学科。
If the humanities have become obsolete, then it may be that humanity is losing its salience.	如果人文学科荒废了，那么这可能是因为人性正在失去其卓越。
I do not mean that we are becoming “less human” in the sense of “inhumane.”	我并不是指在“残忍”这个意义上我们变得“不那么有同情心 ” 。
If anything, we live in a time when traditionally human-centered concerns like “rights” have been extended to animals, if not nature as a whole.	如果有什么的话，那就是,在我们生活的时代，传统的以人类为中心的关注，例如“权利 ” ， 如果没有扩大到整个自然上，也已经扩大到动物身上。
Rather, the problem is whether there is anything distinctive about being human that makes special demands of higher education.	更确切地说，问题是，是否作为人的特质使我们对高等教育有特殊的需求。
I believe that the answer continues to be yes.	我认为答案一直是肯定的。
Today, it sounds old-fashioned to describe the university’s purpose as being to “cultivate” people, as if it were a glorified finishing school.	现在，将大学的宗旨描述成“培养”人似乎过时了，仿佛大学是一个华而不实的女子精修学校。
However, once we set aside its elitist history, there remains a strong element of truth to this idea, especially when applied to the humanities.	但是，一旦我们将其杰出的历史放在一边，这个观点仍然有很强的真实性，特别是在人文学科方面。
Although we now think of academic disciplines, including the humanities, as being “research-led,” this understates the university’s historic role in converting the primate Homo sapiens into a creature whose interests, aspirations, and achievements extend beyond successful sexual reproduction.	虽然我们现在认为包括人文学科的学术课程是以“研究为导向的 ” ， 但是，这仍然低估了大学在 将灵长类智人转变成其兴趣、渴望以及成就不再局限在成功的有性生殖上的历史作用。
What was originally called the “liberal arts” provided the skills necessary for this transformation.	最初被称作“文科”的学科为这个转换停供了必要的技能。
By submitting to a common regime of speaking, writing, reading, observing, and calculating, the “upright ape” acquired the capacity to reason in public.	通过遵守共同的说,写，读，察以及算体系 ， “ 站立的猿人”获得了当众推理的能力。
This enabled first him and then her to command authority regardless of birth, resulting in the forging of networks and even institutions whose benefits cut deeply across bloodlines.	这首先使他，接着使她，在不管其出身的条件下，能够支配权力，从而建立起人际网络甚至是制度，这些人际网络和制度的好处径直超越了血统。
We too easily forget that our heterogeneous societies rely on at least a watered-down version of this training to maintain political and economic order.	我们非常容易忘记，我们成分不同的社会至少依靠一种被打了折扣的训练来维护政治和经济秩序。
The university began with the humanities at its heart, but today it is playing catch-up with the natural sciences.	在最初的大学里，人文学科具有中心地位，但是现在它在和自然科学玩追赶游戏。
This is largely because the natural sciences have most closely imitated the productivity measures associated with industry. The result is a “bigger is better” mentality that stresses ever more publications, patents, and citations.	这主要是因为自然科学最密切地复制了与工业相关的生产力方法，其结果是“越大越好”的思想观念被在越来越多的出版物，专利和引证中加以强调。
Yet, this agenda tends to be pursued without much concern for how – or if – these measures feed into something of greater social, cultural, and even economic relevance.	然而，人们倾向于在完成这个过程中，对这些方法怎样－或者是是否－注入更多的社会、文化甚至经济相关性没有太多的考虑。
The Science Citation Index, originally designed to help researchers discern aggregate trends in increasingly complex subject domains sciences, has helped measure productivity.	最初被设计用来帮助研究人员洞悉日益复杂的各科学领域总体趋势的科学引文索引，帮助测量了生产力。
But now these trends are routinely converted into norms against which the performance of particular universities, departments, and even individual researchers is judged.	但是，现在这些趋势被例行公事地转换成为判断某大学，院系，甚至单个研究员表现的标准。
What is most easily measured has become confused with what is most worth measuring.	最容易被测量的东西已经为最值得测量的东西感到困惑。
But, more profoundly, this entire line of thinking neglects the distinctly transformative capacity of the knowledge in which the humanities specializes.	但是，更深刻的是，这整个的思想路线忽视了人文科学专攻的知识的出众的变革能力。
An adequate assessment of this capacity requires looking at its multiplier effects.	对这种能力充分的评估需要观察其乘数效应。
As with John Maynard Keynes’s notion that returns on public investment must be measured as the long-term consequence of other investments that it stimulates across the economy and society, so, too, with the knowledge generated by the humanities.	按照约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯的观点，公共投资的收益必须用其刺激整个经济和社会的其他投资的长期影响来加以测量，所以，由人文学科产生的知识也应该如此测量。
This idea is lost in today’s cost accounting for universities, which treats what transpires between teacher and student in the classroom as akin to what happens between producer and consumer in the market.	在当今大学的成本会计中，它把在教室里老师和学生之间发生的事情看作在市场上生产者和消费者之间发生的事情一样。
In both cases, it is assumed that the value of the exchanged good is decided shortly after its delivery according to how it satisfies an immediate need.	在这两种情况中，都是假设被交换的商品的价值在商品被交付不久后，按照其满足直接需要的程度确定。
Not surprisingly, students value their degree by the first job it gets them rather than the life it prepares them for over the next half-century.	毫不奇怪，学生们通过他们得到的第一份工作来确定他们的学位的价值，而不是它为他们在接下来的半个多世纪的生活所做的准备。
Today, it is hard to believe that in the heyday of the welfare state, universities were both more elite and more publicly funded than they are today.	现在，很难相信在福利国家的全盛时期，大学比现在更精英化并且更多的接受公共资助。
Back then, it was assumed that the benefits of academic training accrued not only, or even primarily, to those who experienced it but also, and more importantly, to the rest of the population, whose lives were variously enriched by the application of the arts and sciences.	在那时候，人们认为理论训练不仅－甚至是主要的－使接受它的人受益，更重要的是，对其他的人，他们的生命不同程度的因为艺术和科学的应用而变得丰富起来。
Of course, this enrichment included such practical benefits as medical breakthroughs and labor-saving technologies.	当然，这种丰富包括诸如医学突破和节省劳力的技术���样实际的好处。
But the enrichment provided by the humanities was no less enduring, though its subtler nature makes it harder to track.	但是，人文学科停供的丰富一样不朽，虽然它微妙的本质使人很难追寻其踪迹。
Nevertheless, to paraphrase Keynes, every time we turn on the radio or television, read a newspaper, pick up a novel, or watch a movie, we are in the thrall of one or more dead humanists who set the terms of reference through which we see the world.	然而，可以向凯恩斯进行这样的解释，每次当我们打开收音机或电视，看报，拿起一本小说，或者观看一部电影的时候，我们在处在一个或多个死去的人文主义者的思想内,他们设定了参考术语，通过这些术语我们来观察这个世界。
In its long history as the premier form of academic knowledge, the humanities were frequently criticized for their subversive character.	在作为首要的学术知识的悠久历史中，人文学科经常因为其破坏性的特征而遭到批评。
That some would now question whether the humanities have any impact at all merely reflects the crude and short-sighted way in which the value of academic knowledge is measured and judged today.	现在有些人质问人文学科是否具有任何的影响力, 这仅仅反映了现在判断理论知识拙劣而短视的方法。
Perhaps that befits creatures whose lives are “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short,” to recall Thomas Hobbes’ description of the state of nature. But it does a grave injustice to those of us who still aspire to full-fledged humanity.	或许，这适合生命“孤独，贫穷，污秽，粗野和短暂”的生物去回忆托马斯·霍布斯描述的自然状态,但是这对我们当中立志于完整的人性的人是一个重大的不公。
	
Who Needs to Be EU President?	谁需要当选欧盟主席？
Whoever steps into Europe’s new top job as President of the European Council will set the mold.	无论由谁来出任欧盟理事会主席这一新职位都将开启一种新的模式。
If it is someone of worldwide renown, the presidency will immediately be established as a post of global importance.	如果此人闻名世界，欧盟理事会主席一职也将立即成为全球极为重要的职位。
But if its first occupant is not a household name, the presidency will be doomed as just another of the European Union’s confusing plethora of worthy senior positions that are neither valued nor understood outside Brussels.	可如果首任主席默默无闻，那么欧盟理事会主席一职就将注定成为又一个滥竽充数的欧盟高级职位，既不被外界所看重，在布鲁塞尔之外也不为人所知。
The key point here is that Europe won’t be able to upgrade the job later.	问题的关键是欧洲今后没有能力再给这个职位升级。
If the presidency goes to a politician who lacks fame and charisma, its place will forever be low down in the international pecking order.	如果主席一职由缺乏威望和魅力的政治家担任，那么它永远不会在国际权力排行中占据任何优势。
Of the half-dozen candidates to become “Europe’s President,” only Tony Blair needs no introduction anywhere.	在六名竞选“欧洲主席”的候选人中，只有托尼·布莱尔一人无论走到哪里都不需要介绍。
All the other names in the ring have to be accompanied by a description – the former Finnish this or Austrian that.	其它所有人的名字后面都必须加上注脚 — — 前芬兰这个或者前奥地利那个。
Nobody knows whether the current prime ministers of the EU’s 27 member countries will choose Blair.	没有人知道欧盟27个成员国的现任首相是否会选择布莱尔。
There is considerable lingering ill will over his role in the invasion of Iraq, and there is the inconvenient fact that he is from Euro-skeptic Britain, and that many on the left view him as a leader whose “third way” was a betrayal of socialism.	人们对他在入侵伊拉克时所起的作用耿耿于怀，另外一个不利的事实是他来自对欧盟抱有怀疑态度的英国，更有甚者，左翼阵线中有太多人认为他所谓的“第三条道路”就是对社会主义的背叛。
But choosing a president for Europe isn’t about Blair the man, or about the political records of any of the others who would like the job.	但选择欧洲主席不是要看布莱尔的为人，而是要看竞争这一职位的其它人拥有什么样的政治履历。
It is about the job itself.	真正重要的是这个职务本身。
Europe’s problem is that it lacks a clearly identifiable leader.	欧洲的问题在于它缺乏一个广为人知的领袖。
As a result, despite the EU’s many successes, it still speaks with too many voices.	因此，虽然欧盟取得了很多成功，但至今仍然缺乏统一的话语权。
This was among the problems that the EU’s controversial Lisbon treaty was designed to fix.	欧盟备受争议的《里斯本条约》就旨在解决这个问题。
It is now in the final stages of its long and difficult birth, and by the New Year should be bringing new mechanisms to bear to streamline European decision-making.	该条约已经进入漫长而艰苦的诞生过程的最后阶段，到新年来临时应该会带来一种新的机制，对简化欧盟的决策过程施加影响力。
The jewel in its crown is to be the appointment for a 30-month term of a full-time president of the European Council, which groups the heads of EU member governments, along with a foreign policy chief who will be backed by an embryonic EU diplomatic service.	《里斯本条约》这座王冠上的宝石是任命一位任期为30个月的全职欧盟理事会主席，他的职责是与以早期欧盟外交人员为后盾的外交政策首脑们一道，完成对欧盟成员国政府领袖的分组工作。
Now that more than two-thirds of Irish voters have reversed their country’s earlier opposition to the Lisbon treaty – with only the Czech Republic’s Europhobic president, Václav Klaus, holding out against it – the focus is on who will fill these two jobs.	现在已经有三分之二以上的爱尔兰选民改变了态度，不再迫使国家投票反对《里斯本条约 》 — —只有捷克共和国病态惧怕欧元的总统瓦茨拉夫·克劳斯仍然对条约抱着坚决否定的态度 — — 当前问题的焦点是由谁来出任这两个职位。
And that, in turn, has triggered a round of bitter political squabbling that threatens to negate the entire idea of a much more powerful European voice on the global stage.	而这终于又引发了新一轮激烈的政治争吵，在全球舞台上大幅度提升欧洲话语权的整个理念都险些遭到颠覆。
The three Benelux countries, along with a few other smaller EU nations, are opposed to the new European president being from a large nation.	荷、比、卢经济联盟三国和其它几个欧盟小国反对由大国派人担任新的欧盟理事会主席。
And there are also those who fear that a political heavyweight in the job might eclipse the EU Commission’s President, former Portuguese prime minister José Manuel Barroso, who has just been confirmed for a second five-year term, and devalue the role of the foreign policy chief whose authority Lisbon is due to beef up.	也有人担心一个重量级的政治人物可能会让欧盟委员会主席，前葡萄牙总理若泽·曼努埃尔·巴罗佐相形见绌，巴罗佐刚刚确定出任第二个五年任期，这一决策削弱了里斯本本应全力增强的欧盟外交首脑的影响力。
These are specious arguments.	这种说法似是而非。
The EU’s external relations involve two different types of politics.	欧盟的对外关系中涉及两种不同类型的政治。
The first is the politics of world theatre, where a political figure of global stature could do much to raise the EU’s profile and ensure that it has a major say in re-ordering the post-crisis global economic rulebook.	其一是世界舞台上的政治，一个拥有全球成就的政治人物可以大大提升欧盟的政治形象，并确保其在后危机时代的全球经济规则重塑中取得重要的发言权。
The second is the politics of detail, where the new foreign policy chief’s role is to create a single EU stance on the wide range of issues about which European governments still have wildly different national positions.	另一个则是细节的政治，也就是欧盟新的外交政策首脑肩负着在欧洲各国政府立场大相径庭的一系列问题上塑造统一欧盟立场的艰巨任务。
Europe has an international image problem that in part stems from a complex institutional structure that non-EU countries find baffling.	欧洲的国家形象出现了问题，这部分是因为非欧盟国家无法理解���复杂的制度结构。
It is over-represented at G-20 world summits, for instance, but the presence of four European national leaders, plus EU representatives like Barroso, weakens rather than strengthens its political weight.	例如，欧洲在20国集团世界峰会上代表过多，但是四名欧洲国家领导人的出席，再加上像巴罗佐这样的欧盟代表，削弱而不是增强了欧洲的政治影响。
The same is true of other global bodies like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.	欧洲在世界银行和国际货币基金组织的代表权也处于同样的状况。
The result is that Europe’s achievements in recent years – its expansion to create a single economic market of 500 million people and its creation of the euro as a currency that challenges the dollar – are not accompanied by a significantly greater global standing.	因此欧洲近年来所取得的成就 — — 它创造了5亿人的统一经济市场的扩张并建立了挑战美元的欧元货币 — — 并没有使它的国际地位得到显著的提升。
World leaders from Barack Obama to Hu Jintao address themselves to Berlin, Paris, and London, rather than to Brussels.	从巴拉克·奥巴马到胡锦涛的世界领袖寻求与柏林、巴黎和伦敦，而不是布鲁塞尔的对话。
The result is that EU policy proposals that could do much to advance the economic and geopolitical interests of Europeans are not as influential as they could be.	结果造成原本可以大幅度促进欧洲人经济和地缘政治利益的欧盟政策提案并没有充分发挥应有的影响。
The text of the Lisbon treaty is studiously vague in its job description of the president’s role – an approach that prevented trouble for treaty’s framers, but merely postponed disagreement.	《里斯本条约》的具体规定有意在主席的职务描述上含糊其辞 — — 这种方法能为条约的制定者减少麻烦，但所起的作用不过是将分歧的时间推后。
The real argument now taking place between Europe’s national governments is about the authority that the EU’s president should have.	当前欧洲各国政府间的真正争议在于欧盟主席应该拥有什么样的权威。
The risk is that Europe’s squabbling politicians will opt for a figurehead and miss this golden opportunity to create a global leader.	真正的风险在于欧洲争执不休的政客会选择一名傀儡，从而错过这个发挥全球领导作用的黄金时机。
	
Who Next at the ECB Helm?	欧洲央行行长花落谁家？
TILBURG, THE NETHERLANDS – Two years ago, the leaders of the world’s central banks were considered heroes for their efforts in preventing financial crisis from turning into Great Depression II.	发自荷兰蒂尔堡 — — 两年前，各国央行的领导人都受到了英雄般的待遇，因为他们成功阻止了经济危机演变成另一场大萧条。
Today, however, central banks are being sharply criticized, and their independence is coming under severe pressure in many countries, particularly in the eurozone, as Mario Draghi, the head of the Bank of Italy, recently pointed out.	而如今他们却又面对着尖锐的职责，正如意大利中央银行行长马里奥·德拉齐指出的那样，许多国家央行的独立性都受到了极大挑战，特别是欧元区内的那几家。
The type of person at the helm of any central bank is always important – but now more than ever, because financial crises always threaten central banks’ independence.	一国的中央银行究竟该让何人掌舵？ 这个问题通常都至关重要 — — 这在当今则更显尖锐，因为金融危机让央行的独立性备受威胁。
In the United States, the Federal Reserve seems to have support only of the Obama administration, hardly something of which to be proud.	在美国，美联储背后只有奥巴马政府在撑腰，这可不是一件光彩的事。
Congress has disparaged the Fed’s handling of the crisis, and Representative Ron Paul of Texas, who believes that the Fed’s very existence is unconstitutional, will take over one of the key congressional oversight committees in January.	国会对美联储处理危机的手段大加责难，而认为美联储的存在本身就是违宪的德克萨斯州参议员罗恩·保罗将在1月接掌相关国会监察委员会。
More than half of all Americans want politicians to have more say over monetary policy – a scary prospect in view of the historical record.	此外大多数美国人都希望政治家们能对货币政策多发表一点看法 — — 而过去的历史已经证明这并非明智之举。
Given the likelihood of a long period of sub-par economic growth, increasing pressure on public finances in the eurozone, and the ongoing debate on the future of the euro, the European Central Bank has become, more than ever before, the last line of defense for Europe’s common currency.	长期低速经济增长的可能性，欧元区的公共财政压力，以及对欧元未来的讨论三管齐下，以致欧洲中央银行成为捍卫欧洲共同货币的最后一道防线。
A firm ECB president, unwilling to yield to political pressure, is needed.	因此我们需要一个立场坚定，不会向政治压力低头的欧洲央行主席。
During the financial crisis, the ECB has had an outstanding president in the person of Jean-Claude Trichet.	在金融危机期间，欧洲央行有幸拥有让-克劳德·特里谢这位杰出的主席。
But his non-renewable term will end in October 2011, and European leaders are not waiting until the last moment to appoint his successor.	但他的任期将在2011年10届满，而且无法连任，欧洲各国领导人也不可能等到最后一刻才确定他的继任者。
Indeed, positioning and bargaining among the euro’s member countries has already started.	而各欧元区成员国其实之间早已展开了博弈。
First and foremost, the next ECB president should excel on monetary matters.	首先，下一任欧洲央行主席必须精通货币事务。
True, the current financial crisis has brought bank supervision to the fore.	毫无疑问，当前的金融危机使银行监管成为第一要务。
But monetary policy, not bank supervision, is the raison d’être of central banks, whereas the banks can be well handled by the newly established European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), which will be responsible for macro-prudential supervision in Europe from January 1, 2011.	但货币政策才是央行存在的真正理由，而银行事务可以交由新近成立的欧洲系统性风险委员会（ESRB）来承担，该委员会于2011年1月1日开始运作，负责对欧洲各银行的大小事务进行监管。
Furthermore, and contrary to common belief, the ECB president need not be very diplomatic, but should be able to unite all members of the ECB’s Governing Council.	但与一般共识相反的是，欧洲央行主席无须善于外交，但必须有能力团结欧洲央行管理委员会的全体成员。
As political pressure on central banks, including the ECB, increases, its president must not hesitate to criticize European politicians and, if necessary, publicly name and shame them.	随着各国央行（包括欧洲央行）承受的政治压力不断增大，其主席应敢于批评那些欧洲政治家，有必要的话甚至可以公开点名。
The ECB’s independence is its most valuable asset – indeed, it is indispensible.	因为欧洲央行的独立性就是其最宝贵的财产 — — 事实上，这是不可或缺的。
A good central banker must be able to say no to politicians.	一位优秀的中央银行家必须能对政治家说不。
This does not mean the ECB president should pick fights whenever possible.	当然这不意味着欧洲央行主席要四处与人交恶。
On the contrary, he should be able to build support for the ECB’s independence.	相反，他应当能为欧洲央行的独立性赢得支持。
But he should follow the maxim about politicians set down by the ECB’s first president, Wim Duisenberg: “I can hear them, but I do not listen.”	但也要尊崇欧洲央行首任行长维恩·迪森博格应对政治家的座右铭 ： “ 我听到他们说什么，但我不会放在心上 。 ”
The president should also count on support from a majority of Europeans.	这位主席还必须倚靠大多数欧洲人的支持。
Unfortunately, country of origin is highly important in this respect.	不幸的是，在这方面主席的出身也是个异常重要的因素。
Given the fact that the current ECB vice-president is from southern Europe (Portugal), the next head of the ECB must come from northern Europe.	由于当前欧洲央行副主席来自南欧（葡萄牙 ） ， 因此下届欧洲央行主席必须来自北欧。
Only someone from Germany, the Netherlands, or a Scandinavian euro country like Finland can count on support from Germans, which is crucial.	只有那些来自德国，荷兰或者是芬兰这样的斯堪的纳维亚半岛欧元区国家的人才能得到德国人的支持，这点非常关键。
There is certainly someone to be found in the eurozone who possesses all these qualities.	我们当然能在欧元区内找到符合上述要求的人。
In fact, there is more than one.	事实上这样的人选还不止一个。
Draghi is one.	德拉齐是一个。
Others include Klaus Regling, head of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), Axel Weber, President of the Bundesbank, and Jürgen Stark, a current member of the ECB’s Executive Board.	另外还有欧洲金融稳定机构的主管克劳斯·雷格林，德国联邦银行主席阿塞尔·韦伯，还有现任欧洲央行执行董事会董事的荣根·斯塔克。
Draghi’s Italian passport and his past service at Goldman Sachs do not help him much.	德拉齐的意大利国籍以及高盛公司的工作经历对他并无太多帮助。
Regling has a lot of experience, but none in central banking and monetary policy.	雷格林经验甚丰，但在央行事务和货币政策方面则一片空白。
Anyone who wants Stark will need a good team of lawyers to figure out how to convert his current, non-renewable appointment on the Executive Board into an appointment as President without violating the ECB’s rules.	那些钟情于斯塔克的人必须先找一帮好律师，以便想方设法在不破坏欧洲央行规则的情况下让他从现任执行董事晋身为主席。
Given some of Weber’s statements over 2010, he could be accused of being much too undiplomatic.	而考虑到韦伯在2010年发表的某些言论，或许他在外交方面还罗显稚嫩。
Nout Wellink, currently the head of the Dutch central bank, is a wildcard candidate, as is Erkki Liikanen of the Finish central bank.	现任德国中央银行行长的努特·威尔林克也是一位未知的候选人，正如芬兰中央银行行长艾尔奇·林坎南那样。
Both are suitable for the post.	这两人都能胜任欧洲央行行长之位。
The final decision, of course, rests with European heads of state and government.	当然最后的决定还是要由欧洲各国首脑做出。
But, in our view, Trichet’s successor will most likely answer to the name of Weber, Wellink, or Liikanen.	但在我们看来，特里奇是继任者将可能在韦伯，威尔林克和林坎南之间产生。
	
Who Owns Bolivia?	谁是玻利维亚的主人？
A few months ago, Evo Morales became Bolivia‘s first democratically elected indigenous head of state.	几个月前，莫拉莱斯成为玻利维亚首位经民主程序当选的土著人国家元首。
Indigenous groups constitute 62% of Bolivia’s population, and those with mixed blood another 30%, but for 500 years Bolivians had been ruled by colonial powers and their descendants.	土著人占玻利维亚人口的62 ％ ， 混血人口占另外的30 ％ 。 但是在过去500年里，玻利维亚人一直由殖民强国及其后裔统治。
Well into the twentieth century, indigenous groups were effectively deprived of a vote and a voice.	二十世纪很长一段时间，土著人实际上被剥夺了投票权和发言权。
Aymara and Quechua, their languages, were not even recognized for conducting public business.	土著人语言艾马拉语和盖丘亚语甚至不被承认为公共事务用语。
So Morales’ election was historic, and the excitement in Bolivia is palpable.	所以，莫拉莱斯的当选是历史性的，而且玻利维亚民心激动是显而易见的。
But Morales’ nationalization of Bolivia’s oil and gas fields sent shock waves through the international community.	但是，莫拉莱斯将玻利维亚的石油和天然气油田收归国有却令国际社会震惊不已。
During his campaign, Morales made clear his intention to increase state control over national gas and oil.	在竞选过程中，莫拉莱斯明确表明，他打算提高对国家天然气和石油的控制。
But he had made it equally clear that he did not intend to expropriate the property of energy firms – he wanted foreign investors to stay. (Nationalization does not, of course, necessarily mean expropriation without appropriate compensation.)	但是，他还同样明确表明他并不打算征收能源公司的财产，而是想让外国投资者留在玻利维亚（国有化当然并不意味着不经适当补偿予以征收 ） 。
Perhaps surprising for modern politicians, Morales took his words seriously.	莫拉莱斯的言论对于现代政治家们而言可能是令人惊讶的，因此他对自己的承诺严肃对待。
Genuinely concerned about raising the incomes of his desperately poor people, he recognized that Bolivia needs foreigners’ expertise to achieve growth, and that this entails paying fairly for their services.	他真心关心提高其一贫如洗的人民的收入，并认识到玻利维亚需要外国专业知识来取得经济增长，而这就需要公允地支付他们的服务。
But are foreign owners getting more than a fair rate of return?	但是，外国所有者们是否得到了公允的回报率呢？
Morales’ actions are widely supported by Bolivians, who see the so-called privatizations (or “capitalizations”) under former President Gonzalo “Goni” Sanchez de Lozada as a rip-off: Bolivia received only 18% of the proceeds!	莫拉莱斯的行动得到了玻利维亚人的广泛支持。 他们把前总统桑切斯当政期间的所谓私有化（或者“资本化 ” ） 视为抢劫。
Bolivians wonder why investments of some $3 billion should entitle foreign investors to 82% of the country’s vast gas reserves, now estimated to be worth $250 billion.	玻利维亚只获得18％的收入！ 玻利维亚人疑惑不解，为什么大约30亿美元的投资就让外国投资者拥有该国大量天然气储备的82 ％ ， 而这些储备现在估计相当于2500亿美元。
While there has not yet been full disclosure of returns, or an audit of the true value of investments, it appears that investors would, at the old terms, have recouped all their money within just four years.	尽管目前还没有完全披露回报、稽查投资的真实价值，看起来投资者们根据原有条款已经在短短四年时间里收回了全部投资。
Bolivians also ask why foreigners reap all the benefits of today’s high prices for oil and gas?	玻利维亚人还想问，为什么外国人大肆收取当今居高不下的石油和天然气价格的利益？
It costs no more to extract oil or gas today than it did when prices were one-third of their current level.	现在开采石油或天然气的成本并不比当初价格只有现在的三分之一的时候更为昂贵。
Yet, the foreign oil companies get 82% of the increase – in the case of oil, this would amount to a windfall for them of $32 a barrel or more.	但是，外国石油公司得到提价的82 ％ 。 对于石油来说，这将是每桶32美元或者更多的横财。
No wonder that Bolivians thought they were being cheated and demanded a new deal.	难怪玻利维亚人觉得他们受到了欺骗并且要求重新谈判。
On May 2, Morales simply reversed the percentages, pending renegotiation of the contracts: the companies operating in the two largest fields would get 18% of the production for themselves.	5月2日，莫拉莱斯在对合同重新谈判之前一举转变了百分比，也就是在两个最大的油田运作的公司得到其产量的18 ％ 。
As part of this new deal, Bolivia should also get a larger share when prices increase. (Bolivia may, of course, not want to bear the risk of a fall in the price, so it may strike a deal to transfer some of the downside risk to foreign companies, giving them in exchange more of the upside potential.)	作为这一合约的一部分，玻利维亚还应该在价格提高的时候得到更大的份额（当然，玻利维亚并不想承担降价时的风险，因此它可能签署协议，把某些价格下跌的风险转移给外国公司，作为交换，也给它们更多的提价潜力 ） 。
To most Bolivians, what is at stake is a matter of fairness: Should foreign oil and gas companies get a fair return on their capital, or a supernormal return?	对于大多数玻利维亚人而言，公平并不得到保证。 外国石油和天然气公司是否应该在它们的资本上得到公允的还是超乎正常的回报？
Should Bolivia be paid a fair value for its resources?	是否应当为玻利维亚的自然资源支付公允的价格？
And should Bolivia, or foreign companies, reap most of the windfall gains from increases in energy prices?	是玻利维亚还是外国公司应当获取能源价格上扬而带来的意外的收益？
Moreover, many deals were apparently done in secret by previous governments – and apparently without the approval of Congress.	而且，许多交易明显没有得到国会的批准而由前任政府秘密签订。
Indeed, because Bolivia’s Constitution requires the approval of Congress for such sales, it isn’t clear that Morales is nationalizing anything: the assets were never properly sold.	实际上，由于玻利维亚宪法规定此类交易需要得到国会批准，因此并不清楚莫拉莱斯是否在国有化，因为这些资产从来就没有被合法地出售。
When a country is robbed of a national art treasure, we don’t call its return “re-nationalization,” because it belonged to the country all along.	当一个国家的国家艺术珍品被劫掠后，我们不能把归还成为“重新国有化 ” 。 因为这本来就属于这个国家。
As with many privatizations elsewhere, there are questions as to whether the foreign investors have kept their side of the bargain.	正如其他地方的私有化一样，外国投资者是否遵守了他们应当遵守的协议部分还是个问题。
Bolivia contributed to these joint enterprises not only with resources, but also with previous investments.	玻利维亚不仅以自然资源为这些合资企业投入资本，而且还投入了原先的投资。
The foreign companies’ contribution was supposed to be further investment.	外国公司的投入应当是进一步投资。
But did they fully live up to their commitments?	但是，它们是否完全遵守了承诺呢？
Are accounting gimmicks being used to overstate the true value of foreign capital contributions?	是否使用了会计伎俩来过高地申报外国资本投入的实际价值呢？
Bolivia’s government has, so far, simply raised questions, and set in motion a process for ascertaining the answer.	玻利维亚政府目前仅仅是提出了问题，而且开始了澄清答案的进程。
The problem in Bolivia is a lack of transparency, both when contracts are signed and afterwards.	玻利维亚的问题是缺乏透明，不仅是签署协议的时候，也是签署之后。
Without transparency, it is easy for citizens to feel that they are being cheated – and they often are.	没有透明，公民们就很容易感到受到了欺骗，他们经常这样感觉。
When foreign companies get a deal that is too good to be true, there is often something underhanded going on.	当外国公司签订了优惠得不可思议的协议的时候，就经常会有某些不可告人的东西。
Around the world, oil and gas companies have themselves to blame: too often, they have resisted calls for greater transparency.	全世界的石油和天然气公司都是咎由自取，那就是，在大多数情况下，它们拒绝更大透明的呼吁。
In the future, companies and countries should agree on a simple principle: there should be, to paraphrase President Woodrow Wilson’s memorable words, “open contracts, openly and transparently arrived at.”	未来，公司和国家之间应当达成一个简单的原则，那就是，借用美国前总统威尔逊令人难忘的话来说 ， “ 合同应当正大光明 ” 。
If the Bolivians do not get fair value for their country’s natural wealth, their prospects are bleak.	如果玻利维亚无法为其自然财富得到公允的价值，那么，前途就会渺茫。
Even if they do, they will need assistance, not only to extract their resources, but also to improve the health and education of all Bolivians – to ensure long-term economic growth and social welfare.	即使得到了，它们也将会需要援助，不仅仅是帮助开采其资源，而且也是提高玻利维亚人民的健康和教育水平来确保长期的经济增长和社会福利。
For now, the world should celebrate the fact that Bolivia has a democratically elected leader attempting to represent the interests of the poor people of his country.	目前，世界应当为玻利维亚有了一个经过民主程序当选的、力图代表该国穷人利益的领导人而庆贺。
It is a historic moment.	这的确是一个历史性的时刻。
	
Who Pays for Bird Flu?	谁来为禽流感买单？
Fifty years ago, American chicken farmers found that by keeping their birds in sheds they could produce chickens for the table more cheaply and with less work than by traditional farmyard methods.	50年前，美国的鸡农发现大棚养鸡不仅可以提供价廉物美的餐桌肉食，还能比传统庭院养鸡的方式省不少力气。
The new method spread: chickens disappeared from fields into long, windowless sheds.	新的方法被快速推广：肉鸡从田野里消失，搬进了没有窗户的长长的鸡棚。
Factory farming was born.	工厂化养鸡诞生了。
It isn’t called “factory farming” merely because those sheds look like factories.	把这种方法命名为“工厂化养鸡”不仅是因为鸡棚很像工厂。
Everything about the production method is geared towards turning live animals into machines for converting grain into meat or eggs at the lowest possible cost.	生产的所有步骤只有一个目的，就是以最低的成本把活生生的动物变成把粮食转为肉蛋的机器。
Walk into such a shed – if the producer will let you – and you will find up to 30,000 chickens.	如果能得到鸡农的允许入棚参观，就能看到多达30，000只被饲养的肉鸡。
The National Chicken Council, the trade association for the US chicken industry, recommends a stocking density of 85 square inches per bird – less than a standard sheet of typing paper.	美国养鸡业的行业协会全国养鸡协会推荐的养殖密度达到了令人震惊的每只鸡85平方英寸¾还不及一张标准打字纸的大小。
When the chickens approach market weight, they cover the floor completely.	肉鸡快要上市时，会把这块地方塞得密不透风。
No chicken can move without having to push through other birds.	如果不把同伴们挤到一边，它们谁都无法动弹。
In the egg industry, hens can barely move at all, because they are crammed into wire cages, which makes it possible to stack them in tiers, one above the other.	产蛋的母鸡更是一动不动，因为它们被塞进了铁丝编的鸡笼，这样就能一层层堆叠起来，压在同伴的上面。
Environmentalists point out that this production method is unsustainable.	环境专家指出这样的生产方式不能持久。
For a start, it relies on the use of fossil fuel energy to light and ventilate the sheds, and to transport the grain eaten by the chickens.	首先，鸡棚要采用化石燃料来照明通风，并把粮食饲料输送到肉鸡跟前。
When this grain, which humans could eat directly, is fed to chickens, they use some of it to create bones and feathers and other body parts that we cannot eat.	这些粮食本来可以供人类直接食用，现在却被用作饲料喂鸡，而其中一部分变成了骨骼和羽毛，还有其它无法食用的身体器官。
So we get less food back than we put into the birds – and less protein, too – while disposing of the concentrated chicken manure causes serious pollution to rivers and ground water.	这样，从禽鸟身上回收的食物及蛋白质就小于我们的初始投入，而家禽粪便的集中处理又给河流和地下水造成严重的污染。
Animal-welfare advocates protest that crowding the chickens keeps them from forming a natural flock, causes them stress, and, in the case of laying hens, prevents them from even stretching their wings.	动物福利人士抗议把肉鸡挤在一起，认为这样会阻碍其形成自然群落，并造成它们紧张焦虑，而蛋鸡甚至无法伸展自己的翅膀。
The air in the sheds is high in ammonia from bird feces, which are usually allowed to pile up for months – and in some cases for a year or more – before being cleaned out.	鸡棚内的空气充斥着氨气和鸡屎的味道，几个月都得不到清理，有时会堆上一年甚至更长。
Medical experts warn that because the birds are routinely fed antibiotics to keep them growing in such crowded, filthy, and stressful conditions, antibiotic-resistant bacteria could cause a public-health threat.	医学专家警告因为禽鸟日常须饲喂抗生素才能在如此拥挤、肮脏和压抑的环境内持续生长，造成对抗生素有耐受能力的细菌会给公众健康造成威胁。
Yet, despite these well-founded criticisms, over the last 20 years factory farming – not only of chickens, but also of pigs, veal calves, dairy cows, and, in outdoor feedlots, cattle – has spread rapidly in developing countries, especially in Asia.	虽然这些批评不无道理，但过去20年来工厂养殖¾不仅包括肉鸡，还包括肉猪、肉用小牛和室外牧场饲养的肉牛¾在发展中国家，特别是亚洲国家得到迅速的推广。
Now we are discovering that the consequences may be far more deadly than we ever imagined.	现在我们发现由此带来的后果可以比我们预想的要严重得多。
As University of Ottawa virologist Earl Brown put it after a Canadian outbreak of avian influenza, “high-intensity chicken rearing is a perfect environment for generating virulent avian flu viruses.”	正如渥太华大学病毒学家厄尔·布朗在加拿大爆发禽流感之后所说的那样 ， “ 高密度养殖禽鸟是产生致命禽流感病毒的绝佳温床 。 ”
Other experts agree.	其它专家也持同样的意见。
In October 2005, a United Nations task force identified as one of the root causes of the bird flu epidemic, “farming methods which crowd huge numbers of animals into small spaces.”	2005年10月，联合国特遣部队指出禽流感疫情的根源之一是“把大量动物挤入狭小空间的养殖方法 。 ”
Supporters of factory farming often point out that bird flu can be spread by free-range flocks, or by wild ducks and other migrating birds, who may join the free-range birds to feed with them or drop their feces while flying overhead.	工厂式养殖的支持者常常指出：自由放养的家禽也能够传播禽流感，不仅如此，野鸭和其它候鸟与放养家禽争食或飞过时排出粪便也有可能传播这种疾病。
But, as Brown has pointed out, viruses found in wild birds are generally not very dangerous.	但正如布朗指出的那样，野鸟身上发现的病毒一般危险性不大。
On the contrary, it is only when these viruses enter a high-density poultry operation that they mutate into something far more virulent.	恰恰相反，只有当病毒进入高密度禽鸟养殖场时才会出现致命变异。
By contrast, birds that are reared by traditional methods are likely to have greater resistance to disease than the stressed, genetically similar birds kept in intensive confinement systems.	与之形成鲜明的对照，按照传统方法饲养的禽鸟可能比囚禁在狭小环境内性格压抑、基因相似的禽鸟具有更强的免疫力。
Moreover, factory farms are not biologically secure.	不仅如此，工厂式养殖从生物角度讲并不安全。
They are frequently infested with mice, rats, and other animals that can bring in diseases.	棚里到处滋生着能传播疾病的老鼠和其它生物。
So far, a relatively small number of human beings have died from the current strain of avian influenza, and it appears that they have all been in contact with infected birds.	迄今为止，死于当前禽流感病毒的人相对较少，而且这些人似乎都曾与患病鸟类有过接触。
But if the virus mutates into a form that is transmissible between humans, the number of deaths could run into the hundreds of millions.	但如果这种病毒变异到可以在人间传染，那么死亡数量恐怕就会数以亿计。
Governments are, rightly, taking action to prepare for this threat.	政府正在采取恰当的措施应对这一威胁。
Recently, the US Senate approved spending $8 billion to stockpile vaccines and other drugs to help prevent a possible bird flu epidemic.	最近，美国参议院批准花费80亿美元储存疫苗和其它药品，帮助预防可能的禽流感爆发。
Other governments have already spent tens of millions on vaccines and other preventive measures.	其它政府也已花费了几千亿美元购买疫苗，采取其它预防措施。
What is now clear, however, is that such government spending is really a kind of subsidy to the poultry industry. Like most subsidies, it is bad economics.	而目前可以肯定的是：政府开支实际是对家禽养殖业的一种补贴，它也和多数补贴一样不合时宜。
Factory farming spread because it seemed to be cheaper than more traditional methods.	工厂式养殖迅速扩展是因为它似乎比传统方式更为廉价。
In fact, it was cheaper only because it passed some of its costs on to others – for example, to people who lived downstream or downwind from the factory farms, and could no longer enjoy clean water and air.	但实际上它廉价的原因只是把部分开支转嫁到了他人身上¾比如居住在养殖场下风下水的居民，洁净的饮水和空气对他们来讲几乎成了一种奢望。
Now we see that these were only a small part of the total costs.	现在我们知道这只是开支总额中的一小部分。
Factory farming is passing far bigger costs – and risks – on to all of us.	工厂化养殖将比这多得多的成本和风险全部转嫁到我们身上。
In economic terms, these costs should be “internalized” by the factory farmers rather than being shifted onto the rest of us.	用经济术语讲，这些成本应该由养殖户来“内化”承担，而不是转嫁到其它人的身上。
That won’t be easy to do, but we could make a start by imposing a tax on factory-farm products until enough revenue is raised to pay for the precautions that governments now have to take against avian influenza.	这并不容易，但我们可以先对工厂化养殖产品进行课税，来补足政府现在用于预防禽流感所支出的费用。
Then we might finally see that chicken from the factory farm really isn’t so cheap after all.	而后我们就会发现工厂化养殖出来的家禽其实一点都不便宜。
	
The US Still Runs the World	美国仍然主宰世界
WASHINGTON, DC – Reports of the death of American power have often been greatly exaggerated.	华盛顿—关于美国实力已死的报道常常夸大其词。
In the 1950s the Soviet Union was thought to have surpassed the United States; today, the Soviet Union no longer exists.	20世纪50年代，苏联被认为已经超越美国；如今，苏联早已不复存在。
In the 1980s, Japan was widely regarded as on the verge of overtaking the US; today, after more than two decades of Japanese stagnation, no one would take this scenario seriously.	20世纪80年代，日本被广泛认为即将超越美国；如今，日本经历了二十年的停滞，再也没人把这种论断当真了。
And in the 1990s, monetary union was considered likely to propel Europe to greater global prominence; today, the European economy is frequently in the world’s headlines, but not in a good way.	而在20世纪90年代，人们认为货币联盟有望让欧洲赢得更大的全球主宰力；如今，欧洲经济经常见诸世界报端，但不是因为好事。
Now it is China’s turn.	现在轮到了中国。
Until recently, China, in many people’s view, was poised to assume global leadership, if it hadn’t done so already.	直到最近，在许多人眼里，中国即使尚未获得全球领导权，也必将如此。
Today, doubts about the Chinese economy’s long-term prospects are rattling stock markets worldwide (including in the US).	如今，关于中国经济长期前景的怀疑正在冲击全球股市（包括美国 ） 。
China matters, and its economic policy, including how the exchange rate is managed, must be taken seriously.	中国很重要，其经济政策 — — 包括如何管理汇率 — — 也必须认真对待。
But China does not run the world, and it is unlikely to do so anytime soon.	但中国并没有主宰世界，也不可能在近期主宰世界。
The potential for global leadership still rests, believe it or not, with the US.	不管你信不信，全球领导权的未来仍然与美国同在。
The best case for taking China seriously as a world power is made in Arvind Subramanian’s best-selling book Eclipse: Living in the Shadow of China’s Economic Dominance, published in 2011.	真心把中国当成全球力量的最佳例子是2011年出版的阿文德·萨布拉曼尼安（Arvind Subramanian）的畅销书《日蚀：在中国经济主宰的阴影下生活 》 （ Eclipse: Living in the Shadow of China’s Economic Dominance ） 。
(The author, now Chief Economic Adviser at India’s finance ministry, and I were colleagues and sometimes co-authors at the International Monetary Fund and the Peterson Institute for International Economics.)	（本书作者现为印度财政部首席经济顾问，我和他曾在国际货币基金组织和彼得森国际经济学研究所共事，有时合作撰写文章。 ）
One hopes that the Indian government will heed Subramanian’s account of how China grew through exports of manufactured goods and associated productivity improvements.	人们希望印度政府能效仿萨布拉曼尼安所描述的中国如何通过制造品出口和随之到来的生产率改进实现增长。
China also became integrated into global supply chains – producing things for companies elsewhere – on a previously unimaginable scale, and Chinese managers learned how to make better products.	中国还以此前无法想象的规模融入了全球供应链 — — 为其他地区的公司生产东西 — — 中国管理者也学会了如何制造更好的产品。
But other parts of China’s experience have served it less well over time.	但随着时间的推移，中国经验的其他部分效果在减弱。
China ran a very large current-account surplus during the early 2000s and accumulated a vast stock of foreign reserves – including at least several trillion dollars’ worth of US Treasury debt.	21世纪最初几年中，中国存在巨额经常项目盈余，累积了庞大的外汇储备存量 — — 包括至少数万亿美元的美国国债。
Although this looks impressive on paper, reserves of this magnitude are essentially useless.	尽管从纸面上看，这令人印象深刻，但如此规模的储备实际上毫无用处。
If China were to sell its US assets, the dollar would weaken, and US companies would find it easier to export and to compete against imports.	如果中国要出售它的美国资产，美元就会贬值，美国公司也将更容易出口和与进口竞争。
But Americans’ anxiety about being overtaken is not new.	但美国人关于被超越的焦虑并不新鲜。
There was great angst in the late 1980s when a Japanese company bought New York City’s Rockefeller Center.	20世纪80年代末，一家 日本公司买下了纽约市洛克菲勒中心，引起了巨大的不安。
In retrospect, that was one of the great non-events of the twentieth century.	事后看来，这是二十世纪的一桩规模巨大的没事找事。
Similarly, Americans will most likely look back on China’s accumulation of US government debt and simply shrug.	类似地，未来美国极有可能回顾中国囤积美国国债的历史，然后耸耸肩。
The bigger issue is China’s exchange-rate policy.	更大的问题是中国的汇率政策。
For a long time, China prevented the renminbi from becoming overvalued – and this was good policy, as Subramanian’s research confirms.	长期以来，中国阻止人民币高估 — — 这是很好的政策，有萨布拉曼尼安的研究为证。
But in the early 2000s, China went too far.	但21世纪初，中国过犹不及了。
For reasons that are still debated, the renminbi became massively undervalued; exports were much higher than imports, and the current-account surplus reached more than 10% of GDP.	出于至今仍在争论的原因，人民币被大幅低估；出口大大高于进口，经常项目盈余超过了GDP的10 % 。
Instead of letting the renminbi appreciate and gradually reducing their reliance on export markets, the Chinese authorities preferred to accumulate foreign reserves (US Treasury debt).	中国当局没有让人民升值并逐渐减少对出口市场的依赖，而是选择了囤积外汇储备（美国国债 ） 。
Now China has to figure out a way to sustain growth when demand in the rest of the world is sluggish.	如今，中国必须在面临世界其他地区需求停滞的情况下寻找维持增长之道。
A return to a substantially undervalued exchange rate would almost certainly provoke an international response, including from the US Congress.	回归汇率持续低估几乎肯定会激起强烈的国际反弹，包括美国国会。
But switching suddenly to domestic-led growth is not easy.	但猛然转向内需拉动的增长绝非易事。
China will not collapse (it is not the Soviet Union), and Japanese-style stagnation is also unlikely.	中国不会崩溃（它不是苏联 ） ， 日本式的停滞也不太可能。
But China is aging fast – and could become old before it becomes rich.	但中国正在快速老龄化 — — 有可能未富先老。
Every decade, important people predict the end of American power.	每一个十年，都有要人预测美国力量的终结。
And there are reasons to be concerned – particularly when some US politicians refuse to acknowledge the nature of America’s global role.	也确实存在担心的理由 — — 特别是当一些美国政客拒绝承认美国全球角色的性质时。
For example, the US built the world’s trading and monetary system 70 years ago, but now Republicans in Congress refuse to support change at the IMF – including sensible reforms that almost all other countries favor.	比如，70年前，美国构建了世界贸易和货币制度，但如今国会中共和党拒绝支持IMF改革 — — 包括几乎所有其他国家都支持的明智的改革。
Still, it is the US that is currently leading the push for freer trade across the Pacific and a substantial reduction in barriers to trade with Europe.	但是，当前领衔推动跨太平洋自由贸易、大幅降低与欧洲贸易壁垒的仍然是美国。
If America gets the rules right – favoring ordinary citizens, rather than footloose corporations – its trade initiatives will make a major contribution to global growth and its own prosperity.	如果美国正确地制定规则 — — 使之有利于普通公民而不是逍遥的公司 — — 其贸易方案将为全球增长及其自身繁荣做出重大贡献。
Likewise, in terms of monetary policy, the major issue for the world over the next year is when and how much the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates.	类似地，在货币政策上，明年世界所面临的主要问题是美联储何时升息、升息多少。
As US monetary officials gather for their annual Jackson Hole conclave, they will consider myriad relevant dimensions of the global economy.	随着美国货币官员齐聚杰克森霍尔（Jackson Hall）年会，他们将考虑全球经济的诸多重要方面。
But the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee will move interest rates based almost entirely on its collective read of US economic circumstances.	但制定货币政策的美联储公开市场委员会的汇率决定将几乎完全取决于其对美国经济状况的集体解读。
Once again, the rest of the world will react to what the US does.	再一次，世界其他地区将根据美国做什么而做出反应。
	
Who's Afraid of Al Jazeera?	谁惧怕半岛电视台？
No one is indifferent to Al Jazeera, the Qatari-based Arab satellite television station.	没有人胆敢认为卡塔尔的半岛阿拉伯卫星电视台无关紧要。
You can practically see the blood of US officials boil when they discuss it.	美国官员谈起半岛时简直可以说热血沸腾。
To be sure, in the context of the dream of all Arabs being united and independent of foreign control, Al Jazeera is undeniably partial to Arab aspirations.	可以肯定的是，在所有阿拉伯人携起手来、摆脱外来势力控制的梦想里，半岛电视台无可否认地站在了阿拉伯人的一边。
But that does not make its news reporting untruthful.	尽管如此，它的新闻报导依旧真实。
In fact, Al Jazeera, which US Secretary of State Colin Powell calls "horrible" and "slanted," is a pivotal vehicle for reform and change, which genuinely democratic Arab activists and the international community alike have been calling for.	被美国国务卿柯林·鲍威尔称为"可怕 " 、 "偏激"的半岛电视台，实际却是改革变化的关键工具，真正的民主阿拉伯人士和国际社会都期待看到变革的发生。
So incensed has America been, however, that it created its own Arabic language mouthpiece in the form of satellite station Al Hurra.	然而，美国却对此怒不可遏，并创立了自己的阿拉伯语卫星频道自由一台。
Yet Al Hurra is forbidden from broadcasting within the US, because it is state controlled.	但由于受到国家的控制，自由一台在美国属于禁播之列。
Arabs don't trust it, either.	阿拉伯人也对它缺乏信任。
It demonstrated its lapdog status by never broadcasting images of prisoners being abused inside Baghdad's notorious Abu Ghraib prison.	自由一台从未报导过巴格达臭名昭著的阿布格莱布监狱发生的虐俘丑闻，也清楚地暴露了它的哈巴狗嘴脸。
In this respect, at least, Al Hurra fits perfectly within the tame tradition of Arab state broadcasters.	至少在这方面，自由一台完全合乎阿拉伯国家频道温顺驯服的传统。
America, however, is not alone in challenging Al Jazeera head on.	尽管如此，美国并不是唯一向半岛电视台发出挑战的国家。
The BBC, which briefly ran its own Arabic language news station in the mid-1990's - before closing it down because its Saudi funders were unhappy with its reporting - recently announced that it will re-launch an Arabic language news satellite station.	20世纪90年代中期短暂开播过阿拉伯语新闻节目的英国广播公司，不久前宣布将重新开办阿拉伯语新闻卫星频道。 前者由于其沙特出资者不满意它的报导，没坚持多久就遭到停播的厄运。
But instead of bashing or seeking to undermine Al Jazeera, politicians should encourage this bastion of free expression, recognizing that Arabs will need to endure a messy process on the way to democracy.	与痛恨或破坏半岛电视台相反，如果政治家们意识到阿拉伯民主之路是一个十分棘手的过程，那么他们理应鼓励这块言论自由的阵地。
Along that tortuous route, the world's major powers are bound to be offended, probably quite regularly.	在这条崎岖的民主之路上，大国注定会经常受到冒犯。
Television in the Arab world has for years been the mouthpiece used by ruling presidents, kings, and emirs to propagate their official opinions and nothing else.	多少年来，阿拉伯电视台都仅仅是现任总统、国王和埃米尔宣传政策观点的工具。
Elite military units usually protect radio and television stations, because they have often been the first targets in military coups.	电台和电视台常有精锐部队重兵把守，这些地方通常都是军事政变的首要目标。
Given this history, and the storm of calls for reform in the Arab world, it is a tragic irony that America and the West have paid so little attention to the terrestrial Arab monopoly television channels.	有了这样的历史背景和阿拉伯世界高涨的改革呼声，美国和西方世界还如此忽视阿拉伯大陆的垄断电视频道，不能不说是个悲剧性的讽刺。
Indeed, US criticism of Al Jazeera sounds more like special pleading because of America's inept bumbling in Iraq than a genuine desire for free, open, and critical Arab media.	实际上，美国在伊拉克的拙劣表演之后，它对半岛电视台的批评更像是在要求某种特权，而不是真心希望看到自由、开放、观点鲜明的阿拉伯媒介。
If democracy means giving people a free choice, then there is no doubt that the choice of most Arabs is for a television broadcaster that reflects their aspirations.	如果民主意味着赋予人们自由选择的权利，那么毫无疑问，多数阿拉伯人会选择一个代表自己心声的电视媒体。
In this sense, Al Jazeera is clearly biased, because it is run by Arab patriots and reflects Arab sentiment.	从这个意义上讲，半岛的倾向性十分明显，因为它由阿拉伯爱国人士控制，反映了阿拉伯人的呼声。
But this is no more a crime than the fact that America's media reflects American aspirations, and in times of war behaves like a cheerleader for US forces.	就像美国媒体反映美国人民的愿望，并在战争时期充当美国军队的啦啦队长一样，半岛电视台的阿拉伯情结也谈不上什么罪过。
The key issue here is whether Al Jazeera, as well as American TV stations, are truthful in what they say.	这里的关键问题是，半岛电视台是否像美国频道一样，在他们的新闻报导中尊重事实。
Al Jazeera is certainly professional.	半岛无疑是非常职业的。
Its leading journalists are Western-trained, many having worked for years at the BBC.	它的骨干记者都受过西方教育，其中很多人曾在BBC任职多年。
In fact, Al Jazeera was founded only after the BBC closed its Arabic language station under Saudi pressure.	实际上，只是在BBC迫于沙特压力关闭阿拉伯语频道之后，半岛电视台才得以建立。
Al Jazeera's motto, "opinion and opposing opinion," has galvanized Arab viewers, because clashing opinions are rarely heard on terrestrial Arab television stations.	半岛的格言"观点和反面观点"已经给阿拉伯观众留下了深刻的印象，因为在阿拉伯大陆电视台，人们几乎听不到针锋相对的观点冲撞。
Of course, when covering the Israeli occupation of Palestine and the US-led war on Iraq, Al Jazeera has not been objective. How could it be?	当然，在报导以色列占领巴勒斯坦和以美国为首的对伊战争时，半岛没有做到客观，它又怎么可能保持客观呢？
But it did not make up facts; it merely reflected majority Arab opinion.	但它并没有捏造事实，而只是反映了多数阿拉伯人的观点。
On such fundamental issues of Arab consensus, it is simply illogical to expect an Arab broadcaster to be even-handed.	在这些阿拉伯世界公认的根本问题上，要求阿拉伯媒体客观公正显然是不可能的。
Moreover, Al Jazeera has not been dumb to complaints about it.	此外，半岛并没有对反对的呼声置若罔闻。
In July, Al Jazeera became the first Arab TV station to create a professional code of ethics.	7月，半岛成了第一家制定职业道德规范的阿拉伯电视台。
According to the BBC, the code defines with absolute clarity and transparency how Al-Jazeera journalists are to behave, and sets clear divisions between news, analysis, and commentary.	根据BBC的报导，规范明确规定了半岛记者的行为准则，并为新闻、分析和评论内容划出了明确的界线。
As for Al Jazeera's journalistic performance, it is past time that the station be judged by respected professional journalists, not by US or other officials with a policy axe to grind.	说到半岛的新闻表现，电视台由德高望重的职业记者，而不是挥舞政策利斧的美国或其它官员评判的时代已经一去不返。
A major university department of journalism working with Arab media critics, for example, could provide a much more honest analysis of the station's work.	举例来说，与阿拉伯媒体评论家合作过的主要学府的新闻专业，应该能够对该台的工作给予客观得多的评价。
If American, British, and other Western officials are serious about reform in the Arab world, they must support reform-minded Arab individuals and organizations, even if those organizations make them uncomfortable at times.	如果美国、英国和其它西方官员能够认真对待阿拉伯世界的改革，那么他们必须支持具备改革思想的阿拉伯个人和组织，即便这些组织有时让他们感到不快。
If that becomes the West's standard, Al Jazeera will rightly be seen as part of the solution, not part of the problem.	如果这能够成为西方的处事标准，半岛电���台就自然会成为解决方案，而不是问题的组成部分。
	
Who’s Dependent Now?	如今谁在依附？
If the late great Argentine economist Raul Prebisch were alive today, he no doubt would wonder whether the world had turned upside down.	如果阿根廷已故的伟大经济学家罗尔·普里比时如今在世，他肯定会疑惑，这个世界是否换了人间。
His hugely influential “dependency” theory argued that if poor countries relied too much on commodity exports, they would never achieve the industrial depth needed to sustain rapid growth.	他影响深远的“依附”理论认为，如果穷国过度依赖于原料出口，那么。 它们将永远不会达到维持快速增长所需要的产业深度。
Instead, they would become mired in a cycle of declining global commodity prices and ever-dwindling income shares.	实际上，它们将陷于全球性原料价格下跌和不断降低的收入份额的恶性循环之中。
Prebisch’s preferred policy response, protectionism, proved disastrous for the many Latin American and African countries that heeded him.	普里比时所喜爱的政策对应是保护主义。 对于许多听取他的意见的拉美国家和非洲国家而言，这一政策危害不浅。
But the fact is that for many years, Prebisch seemed to have made the right call on long-term commodity price trends.	但是，事实却是，普里比时可能对原料的长期价格趋势作出了正确的预测。
Relentless efficiency gains in agriculture and resource extraction pushed down prices for commodities, especially during the 1980’s and 1990’s.	农业和原材料采集的效率大为提高，降低了原料价格，特别是在二十世纪八十年代和九十年代。
With few exceptions, countries that focused on commodity exports performed dismally, whereas many resource-poor Asian countries raced ahead.	除了少数例外情况，致力于原料出口的国家惨淡经营，而许多资源匮乏的亚洲国家则高歌猛进。
Today, however, with Asia’s giants, India and China, joining the global economy, prices for oil, gold, wheat, and virtually every other commodity are exploding.	然而如今，随着亚洲巨人印度和中国加入全球经济，石油、黄金、小麦以及几乎所有其他原料的价格都在扶摇直上。
While there will always be cycles – oil prices, for example, will probably fall before they start rising again – the long-run trend for many commodities will clearly remain upward for some time to come.	尽管总会有周期，例如说，石油价格再次上升之前可能还会下降，但是，长期而言，许多原料将无疑在一段时期内保持上扬趋势。
What many trade negotiators and other policymakers do not seem to have recognized yet, though Prebisch would have realized it instantly, is that this dramatic turn of events carries huge implications for the global balance of power.	许多贸易谈判代表和其他决策者并未认识到、而普里比时会立即意识到的情况是，对于全球权力平衡而言，这一局势巨变影响巨大。
Indeed, perhaps no other aspect of economic globalization will pose greater challenges to world leaders over the coming decades.	的确，在未来几十年中，可能不会有其他经济全球化的问题对世界各国领导人带来更大的挑战。
The questions are many.	需要解答的问题众多。
Are today’s rich countries prepared for an era of co-dependency, in which they are just as desperate for commodities as developing countries are for industrial imports and technology?	如今的富国是否为相互依附的时代做好准备？ 届时，富国急需原料，正如发展中国家急需工业产品进口和技术。
Are they prepared for the inevitable flow of power and influence to commodity producers as they become much wealthier?	它们是否准备好，随着原料生产国变得大为富有，权力和影响力将不可避免地流向这些国家？
How will the world’s two superpowers, China and the United States, come to terms with the fact that important commodity-exporting regions from Africa to the Middle East to Central Asia are littered with ill-formed nation states?	世界两大超级大国中国和美国如何应对这一事实，即从非洲到中东和中亚的重要的原料出口地区散布于不稳定的民族国家之中？
Some self-anointed seers portray the problem as being one of finite natural resources, with the world running out of critical commodities at an alarming rate.	一些自我吹嘘的预言家认为，问题在于有限的自然资源，关键性原料正在以惊人的速度消失。
Nowadays, there are many adherents of the “Hubbert’s peak” theory of oil production, which holds that we have reached the upper limits of output capacity, the wells are running dry, and it is all downhill from here.	有关石油生产的“哈伯特顶峰”理论认为，我们已经达到了生产能力的上限，油井已经干枯，石油产量将从此下滑。 如今，这一理论的信徒为数众多。
However, as leading oil historian Dan Yergin points out, prophets of doom have declared that the world is running out of oil at least four times already.	但是，正如知名的石油问题历史学家耶金指出的那样，预言大难临头的预言家宣称世界石油耗尽已经至少有四次了。
Each time, radical improvements in technology made the threat evaporate.	每次，技术上的大幅更新都使得威胁不攻自破。
In the late 1800’s, oil extraction involved dredging with a mule.	十九世纪后期，人们用驴来开采石油。
Today, no one thinks anything of drilling 3,000 meters beneath the ocean floor.	今天，人们对在洋底以下3,000米钻井不以为然。
There have been similar improvements across the board in metals mining and agriculture.	在金属采矿和农业方面也有全面的改进。
No, the world is not about to run out of commodities.	世界并不会耗尽原料。
Instead, what is happening is that the integration of 2.5 billion people (China and India alone) into the global economy is producing a demand shift that is likely to put far more upward pressure on commodity prices than any technology gains are likely to offset.	实际上，25亿人口（仅仅是中国和印度两国）融入全球经济，其产生的需求移动带来的对原料价格的上浮压力要远远大于技术进步所可能抵消的部分。
So, for at least the next 50 to 75 years, and perhaps until humans start mining on Mars sometime in the coming centuries, prices for many natural resources are headed up.	所以，在未来50到75年的时间里，甚至未来几百年人类开始在火星采矿之前，许多自然资源的价格都会上扬。
Will the rebalancing of global economic power that results from this destabilize world politics?	由此带来的全球经济力量重新平衡会破坏世界政治的稳定吗？
World War I, of course, was partly set off by Germany’s concern that the other colonial powers had locked up too large a share of world oil and commodity supplies.	第一次世界大战无疑是部分由于德国担忧其他殖民列强占据了过多的世界石油和原料供应而引发。
Similarly, in World War II, Japan feared for the stability of its foreign supplies of oil and other natural resources.	类似的情况是，在第二次世界大战中，日本对它的石油和其他自然资源的稳定供应感到担心。
Will similar tensions arise between resource-challenged China (where even water scarcity is a problem) and the West?	资源短缺的中国（甚至连用水短缺都成为问题）和西方之间会产生类似的紧张关系吗？
Fortunately, this does not seem likely for the moment, especially given the Chinese leadership’s sober and pragmatic approach to its resource problems.	幸运的是，目前这并不大可能，特别是鉴于中国领导人对其资源问题采取冷静和务实的做法。
The Chinese are looking to regions like Africa, hoping to find stable trading partners.	中国正在寻求类似非洲那样的地区，希望找到稳定的贸易伙伴。
They do not share the political evangelism of the Americans, who don’t just want to trade with commodity exporters, but to convert them as well.	他们并不像美国人那样具有政治福音教义。 美国人不仅想要与原料出口国做交易，而且同时想要使其皈依。
Then there are those American leaders who still speak of making the US self-sufficient in energy supplies.	有的美国领导人还在谈论美国的能源供应自给自足。 但是这基本上是一个笑话。
But this is basically a joke: self-indulgent, maybe, but self-sufficient, never.	可能是一个空想，而永远不会自给自足。
Much of the Arab world understandably views the invasion of Iraq as the cornerstone of the real US strategy for securing stable energy supplies.	可以理解的是，大多数阿拉伯世界把入侵伊拉克视为美国真正的确保稳定能源供应战略的基石。
If they are right, one can only hope that America has a plan B.	他们如果是正确的话，但愿美国还有第二套方案。
Meanwhile, commodity prices will continue to rise, with oil exporters now constituting the largest contributors to America’s gaping trade deficit.	目前，原料价格将继续上升，石油生产国现在成为美国庞大贸易赤字的最大因素。
Maybe the real US strategy is to try to owe the commodity-exporting countries so much money that they will feel dependent on making America happy!	美国的真实战略可能是试图欠原料出口国大量金钱，迫使它们感觉要依赖于讨美国的欢心！
That is one twist that Prebisch would never have anticipated.	这一变局是普里比时所永远不会料想得到的。
	
Whose Champions, Anyway?	大公司到底是谁的？
The links between states and companies have grabbed headlines, most recently in Russia, where President Vladimir Putin seems obsessed with creating “national champions” in the energy and aerospace sectors.	最近在俄国，国家和公司之间的关系占据了报纸的头版头条，弗拉基米尔·普京（Vladimir Putin）总统似乎沉湎于在能源和航天领域建立“全国性大公司”的梦想。
Such efforts seem but a part of a surge of protectionism in European political debate about business, especially when it comes to cross-border acquisitions.	普京的所作所为只是当前欧洲政治辩论中企业保护主义甚嚣尘上的一部分表现，尤其是在涉及到跨国收购问题时这种保护主义趋势就更加明显。
Across Europe, governments position themselves to be seen as defending “national” players from “foreign” competitors.	欧洲所有国家政府无一不在履行保护“国内”企业免受“国外”竞争威胁的职责。
“Economic patriotism,” the slogan coined by France’s Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin following PepsiCo’s rumored attempt in July 2005 to takeover Danone, perhaps best encapsulates the political imperative.	“经济爱国主义”是法国总理多米尼克·德维尔潘（Dominique de Villepin）在2005年7月百事公司传闻收购达能集团后创造出来的口号，也可能是对上述政治责任的最佳概括。
Although de Villepin’s speeches are more flamboyant than those of most political leaders, the underlying sentiment extends far beyond France.	虽然德维尔潘的辞藻比其他多数政治领袖都要华丽，但内中所蕴含的核心精神却绝对不仅局限在法国。
The same impulse appears to be at work behind Italy’s policy on Autostrade, Spain’s on Endesa, Poland’s on its banking sector, the former Swedish Prime Minister’s on Volvo, German unease about “locust”-like funds on Deutsche Börse, or the United Kingdom’s ever louder defense of the London Stock Exchange’s independence from the United States.	如出一辙的冲动似乎也左右了意大利对Autostrade公司、西班牙对Endesa公司、波兰对银行业和瑞典前首相对沃尔沃公司的政策。 德国对“入侵者”的戒惧¾比如拨款支持德国证券交易所，或是英国大张旗鼓地捍卫伦敦证交所相对于美国的独立性，背后也隐藏着同样的原因。
The basic belief that underpins “economic patriotism” is that of an alignment of interests between companies considered “national” (most prominently the largest ones or so-called “champions”), their national employees, and the national community.	支撑“经济爱国主义”的基本理念是在“国内”公司（尤其是大公司或者所谓“顶级公司 ” ） 、国内雇员以及各式各样的国内团体之间建立起利益联盟。
According to de Villepin, “to defend the employees’ interests well, we must protect the interests of our companies.”	按照德维尔潘的话讲 ， “ 为了更好地保护员工的利益，我们必须先保护好国内公司的利益 ” 。
He later argued that Danone should be considered “French” because its “milk collection and its water sources are in France.”	他接下来提出达能应该算作“法国”的企业，因为该公司“奶源和水源均取自法国 ” 。
But Danone’s own filings indicate that only 22% of its global sales and less than 14% of its global workforce are in France.	但达能公司的内部档案显示，该公司仅有22%的全球销售额来源于法国，而法国境内的员工人数还不到其全球员工总数的14 % 。
In fact, the link between European companies and national communities is becoming more tenuous by the day.	事实上，欧洲公司和国内团体之间的联系已经日渐薄弱。
Research that I carried out for Bruegel surveyed the largest 100 listed companies headquartered in Europe (ranked by market capitalization) and analyzed the geographical distribution of their revenue, which is increasingly transparent since the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) last year.	我为Bruegel所作的研究调查了以欧洲为总部的百强上市公司（按市场资本总额进行排序 ） ， 并分析了其收入来源的地理分布状况。 去年国际财务报告准则（IFRS）正式实施后，公司营业收入的来源及分布状况的透明度也大大增加。
Europe was divided into eight broad zones, comprising individual countries like Germany, France, and Italy, or groupings of smaller countries such as Benelux and the Nordic area.	这项研究把欧洲分成了8大区域，囊括了德国、法国、意大利等国家或卢比荷关税同盟及北欧区域联盟等小型国家集团。
The survey then calculated the share of revenue earned by each company in the zone in which it is headquartered (or “home base”), the rest of Europe, and the rest of the world.	调查接下来计算了总部设在区域之内、欧洲其他国家和世界其他国家的各公司所挣得的收入份额。
Where relevant information for companies was available, the comparable distribution of employees was also examined.	如果能找到相关资料，我们也对员工的可比分布进行了研究。
The results show that the share of the home base in total revenue has become, on average, relatively low: just three-eighths, or 37.5%, on average for Europe’s largest 100 companies.	结果显示总部所在地收入在总收入中所占的比重平均相对较低：欧洲百强公司平均只有八分之三，或37.5 % 。
Of course, this figure covers a wide diversity of industries, and also some geographical differences across the continent.	当然，这一数字包含各式各样的行业，而且欧洲大陆的不同国家也存在一些地理上的差异。
For example, the averages for German (34%) or French (35%) companies are markedly lower than for their Spanish (56%) or Italian (65%) counterparts.	比如，德国公司（34 % ） 和法国公司（35 % ） 的平均数就比他们在西班牙（56 % ） 或意大利(65 % ) 的同伴有着显著的差距。
But the general trend is unambiguous.	虽然如此，但总体趋势依然十分清晰。
For a broadly representative sub-sample of 55 companies that could be tracked since 1997, the proportion of revenue generated in the home region has fallen sharply on average, from 50.2% to 36.9%.	在1997年后追踪的具有广泛代表性的55个公司子样中，总部所在地的收入比重平均起来都有大幅度下降，从50.2%降到了36.9 % 。
For these companies, sales to the “rest of Europe,” which represented an average of less than 30% of total European sales in 1997, rose above 43% in 2005.	同样在这些公司中，对“欧洲其他国家”的销售额1997年平均只占其欧洲总销售额的不到30 % ， 而2005年已经上升到超过43 % 。
If the trend is extrapolated, the home bases of Europe’s largest companies will account, on average, for less than half of their European revenue, and less than a third of their global revenue, before the end of this decade.	如果这样的趋势得以延续，那么到2010年，欧洲最大公司在所在地获得的收入占其欧洲地区总收入的平均比重将低于一半，而在其全球总收入中所占的比重将低于三分之一。
These companies are “Europeanizing” fast, and the relative weight of their home base is declining even faster.	这些公司正在迅速实现“欧洲化 ” ， 其所在地的相对重要性则下降得更为迅速。
Moreover, this is not just a story about sales. The survey also measured the geographical distribution of employees relative to the distribution of revenue.	调查不仅研究了销售状况，还研究了员工的地理分布与收入分布之间的相对关系。
While the distribution profiles between employees and revenue could be sharply dissimilar in some companies, on average they were almost identical: for a sub-sample of 73 companies among Europe’s top 100, the home base represented 37% of employees and 35% of revenue on average in 2005, while the rest of Europe accounted for 29% of employees and 28% of revenue.	尽管有些公司人员和收入的分布状况可能相去甚远，但一般来讲这两者都具有一致性：名列欧洲百强的73家公司子样中，其原属地在2005年占员工总数和收入总数的平均比例分别是37%和35 % ， 而欧洲其他地区占员工总数和收入总数的平均比例则分别是29%和28 % 。
This strongly suggests that jobs broadly “follow” sales (or perhaps the other way round), even though, once again, this is true only on average and not for all companies.	这样的结果有力地表明：尽管只适用于部分公司的平均状况，但就业的分布状况与销售的分布状况大致关系呈“正相关 ” （ 反之亦然 ） 。
What are the implications for policymakers?	政府决策者能从中得到什么启示？
Put simply, the numbers show a growing gap of interests between these so-called “champions” and their national home bases.	简言之，上述统计数据显示了这些所谓的“顶级公司”和他们的总部所在地之间有着越来越明显的利益差异。
For Europe’s governments, fostering champions increasingly means providing benefits to non-national customers and employees – a dubious use of taxpayer money.	对欧洲政府来讲，培育顶级公司越来越多地意味着为非国民客户和员工提供好处¾这种利用纳税人钱财的方式非常值得怀疑。
Another consequence is that regulatory competition is likely to increase in Europe, as companies are less bound by local interests to keep their headquarters at “home” if the tax or regulatory environment becomes unfavorable.	另外一个结果就是欧洲各国的管理竞争可能会加剧，因为在税收或管理环境不那么有利的情况下，本地利益不再能约束公司继续把总部设在“本国 ” 。
The decision by Depfa Bank to shift its headquarters from Wiesbaden to Dublin in 2002 may be a sign of things to come.	德国银行2002年决定把总部从威斯巴登迁往都柏林的举动可能就代表了未来的趋势。
The biggest risk is that the growing disconnect between the perception of “national” companies and the reality of Europeanization may lead to spectacularly ill-judged policies.	其中最大的风险是，人们对“国内”公司的传统认识和欧洲化日益扩大的现实可能会导致在制定政策时南辕北辙。
It is high time for business leaders to be more candid about where their real constituencies lie, and for national politicians to recognize that they can no longer wield control over the giants of today’s European business.	现在是时候让企业领导者坦率地公布他们真正的客户到底在哪里，也是时候让国内政治家们明白，他们今天再也无法真正控制欧洲的企业。
	
Whose Corporate Social Responsibility?	谁的企业社会责任？
NEW YORK – Increasingly, corporations are under pressure, often from activist non-governmental organizations, to take on specific “corporate social responsibility” (CSR) obligations.	发自纽约 — — 以非政府组织为首的外界正向企业施加越来越大的压力，要求他们去承担某些特定的“企业社会责任 ” 。
But the fact that CSR is being demanded, and occasionally conceded, does not ensure clarity about either its rationale or the ways in which it should be undertaken.	但即便对这类责任的呼声越来越大，企业也偶尔做出让步，却不能确保这些责任以及承担这些责任的方式是合理的。
CSR can be divided into two categories: what corporations should do (say, contribute to a women’s rights NGO or build a village school) and what they should not do (say, dump mercury into rivers or bury hazardous materials in landfills). The latter is wholly conventional and subject to regulation (and recently to questions about how corporations should behave when there are no host-country regulations).	一般来说，企业社会责任可以被分成两类：企业应该做的（比如说向一个保护妇女权益的非政府组织捐款，或是捐建一所乡村学校）以及不应该做的（向河中排放水银或在填埋场掩埋危险物料 ） ， 而后者属于一般性行为，且易于监管（但在东道国缺乏相关监管的情况下，企业该如何作为？
	对此也有争论 ） 。
But are CSR obligations really good practice?	但是，企业承担社会责任真的一种合理的行为吗？
Milton Friedman and other critics often asked if it was the business of businesses to practice corporate altruism.	米尔顿·弗里德曼以及其他一些批评家一直都质疑企业是否应开展利他主义行为。
Prior to the rise of the corporation, there were mainly family firms, such as the Rothschilds. When they made money, it accrued principally to the family itself.	在企业诞生之前，社会上存在的主要是一些诸如罗斯柴尔德这样的家族产业，赚到的收入主要归家族所有。
Altruism, where it existed, also was undertaken by the family, which decided how and on what to spend its money. Whether the firm or its shareholders and other stakeholders spent the money was beside the point.	那个时候，利他主义行为主要也是由家族来承担，钱怎么花，花在哪里，决定权都在家族手里，而不是在企业或其股东以及其他利益相关者身上。
With the rise of the business corporation, large family firms have generally disappeared.	随着企业的发展壮大，大型家族产业大多退出了历史的舞台。
But that does not mean that a corporation is the right entity to engage in altruism – though its various stakeholders obviously can spend any portion of the income they earn from the corporation and other sources in altruistic ways.	但这并不意味着企业就是继承利他主义的合适主体 — — 当然，企业的股东完全可以把自己从企业和其他渠道赚来的钱以个人名义花在利他主义行为上。
Instead of CSR, we should have PSR (personal social responsibility).	实际上，相对于企业社会责任这个说法，我们更应该提倡的是个人社会责任。
One can also argue for PSR on the grounds that asking for CSR becomes a way of “passing the buck” – evading personal responsibility for doing good.	个人社会责任之所以更加合理，是因为苛求企业承担社会责任已经成了一种“推卸责任”的途径 — — 企业责任已经成了个人逃避行善的借口。
This is the flip side of blaming corporations for everything from obesity to scalding from spilled coffee – both the subject of lawsuits in recent years.	而这恰恰是人们把肥胖到被咖啡烫伤都统统归咎于快餐店的背后原因 — — 近年来，这类诉讼已经成为了大热门。
There is also an added advantage in replacing CSR with PSR: there is virtue in diversity of approaches to altruism.	此外，以个人社会责任取代企业社会责任还有一个好处：因为其优势在于可以利用多种途径来具体实现利他主义。
Chairman Mao wanted a hundred flowers to bloom, but only so that he could cut them all off at their roots.	企业社会责任就像毛主席提倡“百花齐放 ” ， 最终只是为了获得斩草除根的结果。
But PSR is more like President George H.W. Bush’s metaphor of a “thousand points of light.”	但个人社会责任却更像老布什总统说所说的那样“发出万千光芒 ” 。
Moreover, it is hard to see how a corporation’s stakeholders can always arrive democratically at a common position on how the corporation should engage in social responsibility on their behalf.	而且在公司如何代表他们来承担社会责任的问题上，很难想象一间公司的股东能够民主地达成共识。
Each will consider his or her CSR view the best.	毕竟每个人都会觉得自己的想法是最好的。
But there are strong arguments in favor of CSR as well. First, the political reality is that society treats corporations as if they were persons, which is often also a legal reality for many purposes.	不过话又说回来，企业社会责任也有其存在的依据：首先，不可忽略的一个政治现实是，社会以对待个人的要求来对待企业，这在许多方面也是一个法律现实。
Society increasingly demands that these “corporate citizens” be altruistic, just as people are.	社会越来越要求这些“企业公民”要如社会上的个人一样承担起利他主义的责任。
Given this reality, corporations want to give simply because it is expected of them.	在这种情况下，企业愿意承担起相应的责任也只是因为社会是这样的期待它们的。
Such CSR builds the firm’s image as a “good” corporation, just as giving by Bill Gates and Warren Buffet builds their image as “good” billionaires.	而承担这些责任也为企业建立起了“良好”形象，正如参与慈善事业为比尔·盖茨和沃伦·巴菲特这些亿万富翁建立起了“富贵善人”形象一样。
Second, many corporations view CSR as an effective defensive strategy against powerful activist NGOs (such as Greenpeace) that have taken to using online agitation, boycotts, and other means to “blackmail” targeted corporations into acceding to the activists’ demands.	其次，许多公司都把企业社会责任作为一种有效的防御性战略，以此来应付那些非政府组织（诸如绿色和平组织 ） — —这些人利用网络煽动，抵制和其他各种方法来迫使企业满足他们的要求。
The more CSR a company can point to, the less such efforts will succeed – or even be mounted.	而企业越是承担起社会责任，那些非政府组织的要挟就越不可能成功 — — 甚至反过来被企业所利用。
Consider the contrasting experiences of Coke and Pepsi.	试回想一下可口可乐与百事可乐这个两个截然相反的例子。
Coke has been targeted by NGOs for alleged lapses in labor and environmental standards.	可口可乐公司在劳资关系和环保标准等问题上与非政府组织纠缠不休，声名狼藉。
By contrast, Pepsi, which once teamed up with AT&T and the CIA to oust President Salvador Allende in Chile, smells like a rose nowadays, because it has distributed CSR largesse to several causes that influential NGOs embrace.	相反，曾与AT&T和中情局联手驱逐了智利总统萨尔瓦多·阿连德的百事可乐公司却誉满天下，原因很简单，因为它在好几个由大型非政府组织发起的运动中都表现出了极大的企业社会责任感，慷慨解囊。
That is a lesson that Wal-Mart has since learned.	沃尔玛在这个问题上也吃过亏。
In 2005, the Service Employees’ International Union (SEIU) created Wal-Mart Watch, with an annual budget of $5 million. The purpose was to make Wal-Mart a “better employer, neighbor, and corporate citizen,” and Wal-Mart eventually capitulated on some of the SEIU’s specific demands as well.	在2005年，服务业雇员国际工会（SEIU）创立了一个名叫沃尔玛监视者的组织，每年活动经费500万美元，目标只有一个，就是为了使沃尔玛成为一个“更好的雇主，邻居和企业公民 ” ， 而沃尔玛最终也只能屈从于SEIU的某些特殊要求。
Finally, CSR can be simply a matter of advertising.	最后，企业社会责任也可以仅仅作为一个宣传手段。
In this case, the choice of CSR spending is focused directly on generating added revenue, much like advertising, and is aimed at sales much the way advertising is.	在这种情况下，选择承担责任主要是为了直接创造额外收益和刺激销售额上升，正如广告的效果一样。
A benign example is Adidas’s sponsorship of tennis tournaments.	阿迪达斯赞助网球比赛就是一个很好的例子。
A malign example is Philip Morris’s donation of money to museums, symphony orchestras, and opera houses, cynically aimed at buying off artists who might otherwise work to ban cigarettes.	而烟草巨头菲利普莫里斯公司给博物馆，交响乐团以及歌剧院的慈善捐款则别有用心，捐款被揭露是出于收买那些地方的艺术家，好让他们不要致力于禁烟运动。
All these rationales for CSR suggest that it should be left to each corporation to determine, just as PSR leaves altruism to each individual’s conscience and sense of what needs supporting.	总的来说，所有承担企业社会责任的行为都应该由企业自己来决定，正如个人社会责任让每个个人依靠自己的良知和感觉来进行判断，决定哪些事情是值得支持和赞助的一样。
The attempt by some NGOs and activists to impose a straitjacket on CSR, reflecting their priorities, is misguided and must be rejected.	部分非政府组织以及一些社会活动家都企图按照他们自己的个人好恶来左右企业社会责任的实现，这样的做法绝对是个误导，必须坚决抵制。
Instead, the model should be former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan’s initiative, the Global Compact.	所以说，联合国前秘书长科菲·安南所提倡的“全球契约”才是理想的方案。
What Annan has done is to embrace ten wide-ranging guiding principles while leaving signatory corporations free to choose that which they wish to support actively.	安南的贡献在于他列出了范围广泛的十大指导性原则，而把选择承担哪些社会责任的权利留给了签约企业，让他们自由选择。
	
Whose Georgia?	格鲁吉亚究竟属于谁？
In recent weeks, leaders of various opposition organizations in Georgia, such as Antisoros and Fairness, have been jailed on unfair accusations of plotting a coup on behalf of Russia.	最近几周，格鲁吉亚“反索罗斯”运动和“公正”党等反对组织领袖都因遭到不公正指控而入狱，罪名是替俄国策划政变。
But the wave of political repression merely reflects President Mikhail Saakashvili’s desperate effort to cling to power.	但新一轮政治镇压不过反映了米哈伊尔·萨卡什维利(Mikhail Saakashvili)总统想要继续掌权的疯狂努力。
With popular dissent growing and opposition forces strengthening, the authorities have sought to controll non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and strengthen the security forces.	随着公众不满与日俱增，反对力量日渐强大，格鲁吉亚当局试图掌控非政府组织（NGO ） ， 并加强安全力量。
But this will only make mass protests inevitable, ultimately jeopardizing the democratic transition in Georgia that Saakashvili claims to represent.	但这样的努力只会导致公众抗议不可避免，最终致使萨卡什维利声称代表的格鲁吉亚民主转型陷入危险之中。
Saakashvili sees a “Moscow hand” in every challenge to his authority, which could be explained by his government’s close alliance with the United States.	萨卡什维利认定对他权威的每次挑战背后都有“莫斯科的操纵 ” ， 原因是他所领导的政府与美国建立了亲密的伙伴联盟。
But the people rounded up in the latest raid against the opposition were originally imprisoned by Eduard Shevarnadze’s government, which Saakashvili helped depose in Georgia’s supposedly democratic “Rose revolution” in 2003.	但不久前聚在一起袭击反对派的民众很多都曾受到过爱德华·谢瓦尔德纳泽(Eduard Shevardnadze)政府的监禁，谢瓦尔德纳泽政府在被认定为民主运动的2003年“玫瑰革命”中被萨卡什维利推翻。
The latest events clearly indicate that a czarist mentality survived the revolution, reflected in a Byzantine model of political power — an emperor and his court — that has as its main vehicle largely unconstrained presidential authority.	不久前的事件显然表明沙皇主义思想逃过了革命的清洗，并在拜占庭模式（皇帝及其法庭）的政权下把基本不受控制的总统权力作为其执政的主要手段。
Before the security forces targeted the opposition bloc that I represent, supporters of educational reforms were prosecuted, while most of the press is under the influence of the government.	在安全部队打击我所代表的反对派集团之前，教育改革的支持人士已经遭到了迫害，而绝大多数媒体都处在政府的严密控制之下。
Saakashvili claims that the opposition forces that I represent oppose Western values.	萨卡什维利称以我为代表的反对力量抵制西方价值观。
But we advocate parliamentarism – genuine separation of executive and legislative power – in Georgia.	而我们却积极倡导在格鲁吉亚推行议会制度，从而在真正意义上实现行政和司法权力分开。
And, in supporting the Western model of parliamentariansm, we are on the side of Georgia, not Russia.	而且从支持西方议会模式的角度讲，我们也代表了格鲁吉亚、而非俄国的立场。
It is strange that Saakashvili, a graduate of Columbia Law School, fails to see the disparity between his own democratic rhetoric and autocratic actions.	作为哥伦比亚大学法学院的毕业生，萨卡什维利看不到自己的民主言论与独裁行为之间的差异真是咄咄怪事。
Thus, those of us who value Georgia’s historical ties with Russia are called, at best, “archaists,” and at worst “enemies of Georgian independence,” as if Georgia would become a Russian colony if we ever came to power.	于是，珍惜格鲁吉亚与俄国历史渊源的人士被客气地称做“复古主义者 ” ， 更有甚者，他们被指责为“格鲁吉亚独立的敌人 ” ， 就好像我们一上台，格鲁吉亚就会沦为俄国的殖民地。
But what separates us from Saakashvili is that we understand that history, geography, and economics dictate close ties to Russia.	但我们与萨卡什维利的不同之处就是我们了解是历史、地理和经济因素造就了我们与俄国之间的密切关系。
We simply see no contradiction between that stance and support for Western values.	我们认为这一立场与支持西方价值观之间没有任何冲突。
Indeed, even Russia, with all its imperfections, cannot be said to oppose Western values.	实际上，尽管俄国有着各种各样不尽如人意之处，也不能说俄国反对西方的价值观。
The unfortunate paradox in Georgia – and elsewhere in the post-Soviet world – is that self-serving pro-Western rhetoric has often led democratic values to be sacrificed in favor of a new dictatorship.	与后苏联世界的其他国家一样，格鲁吉亚所面临的不幸悖论是：只为一己私利的亲西方言论经常为了迎合新的专制统治而牺牲民主价值观。
When the West actively supports popular revolutions, as in Georgia and Ukraine, the newly established power relies on democratic slogans, not democratic behavior.	西方积极支持格鲁吉亚和乌克兰的民众革命，但革命所建立的政权依托的却是民主口号，而不是民主行动。
Shevardnadze, too, was initially viewed as a symbol of post-Soviet Georgian democracy.	谢瓦尔德纳泽一度也曾被看作后苏联时代格鲁吉亚民主的象征。
As a government minister in 1993, however, I was already hearing CIA officials express concern that a “Mafia state” was being created instead.	但在1993年任政府部长时，我已经听到中央情报局官员对格鲁吉亚沦为“黑手党国家”的可能性深表忧虑。
First with Shevarnadze, and now with Saakashvili, popular disillusionment reflects not rejection of democracy, but frustration with its continuing absence.	以前是谢瓦尔德纳泽，现在是萨卡什维利，格鲁吉亚民众的觉醒并不代表拒绝民主，而恰恰是民主的长期缺位使他们感到心灰意冷。
Saakashvili is evidently mesmerized by the US, and the West in general, but what is the point if there is no independent and democratic political process in Georgia today?	萨卡什维利显然对美国和西方世界有着异乎寻常的迷恋，但如果今天的格鲁吉亚没有独立和民主的政治程序，单纯的迷恋美国又有什么意义？
And why, then, is sustaining close ties to the US so desirable, while refusing to dismiss Russia as a partner is regarded as being an agent of the Kremlin?	为什么与美国保持密切关系就那么令人期待，而拒绝排斥与俄国的合作就成了克里姆林的代言人？
Is the US, in contrast to Russia, by definition honest, innocent, and high-minded?	是不是与俄国相比，美国就一定诚实、纯洁、高尚？
There should be no place for such unfortunate double standards.	绝不能容许这种双重标准的存在。
Regardless of what the Saakashvili government claims about his opponents, our political orientation is not pro-Russian, but pro-Georgian.	无论萨卡什维利政府对反对派人士作何评价，我们的政治倾向不是亲俄，而是亲格鲁吉亚。
We believe that Georgia should pursue its own interests, which it may share with Europe, Russia, or the US, but which are nonetheless our own.	我们相信格鲁吉亚应该勇敢追求自身的利益，这些利益也许与欧洲、俄国或美国所共有，但即便如此仍要坚持从我们自身出发。
We have no interest in merely executing US policy, or in basing Georgia’s foreign and domestic policy solely on distancing the country from Russia, as Saakashvili has done.	我们对单纯执行美国的政策不感兴趣，也不愿像萨卡什维利那样，把疏远俄国作为格鲁吉亚的外交和内政的基础。
Thus, pro-Georgian politics should not countenance nationalism.	因此，亲格鲁吉亚政治不应支持民族主义。
Nowadays, some of our politicians have embraced the slogan “Georgia for Georgians.”	今天，我们有些政治家笃信“格鲁吉亚人的格鲁吉亚”的口号。
But nationalism suggests the lack of a coherent conception of Georgia’s interests.	但民族主义者显然对格鲁吉亚的利益缺乏深入的了解。
Georgia’s tradition as a multinational, tolerant state, which has been weakened in the last 15 years, must be reinvigorated, because we have no need for enemies against which to define ourselves.	过去15年来，格鲁吉亚作为一个多民族、宽容国家的传统遭到了削弱，而现在必须加以恢复，因为我们不需要以树敌的方式来定义自身的存在。
A strong relationship with Russia need not come at the expense of relations with America and the West, and vice versa.	与俄国建立密切的联系并不一定要损害与美国和西方的交往，反之亦然。
Georgia should be neither pro-Russian nor pro-American.	格鲁吉亚不应该亲俄、也不应该亲美。
It is a small, poor country that desperately needs stability and economic development.	它是一个贫困的小国，迫切需要的是稳定和经济发展。
Its model should not be Palestine and permanent battle, but Switzerland and permanent prosperity.	我们的榜样不应该是巴勒斯坦的永久战争，而应该是瑞士的持久繁荣与和平。
	
Whose War on Terror?	谁的反恐战争？
“We are all Americans,” wrote Le Monde on September 12, 2001.	2001年9月12日法国世界报写到 ： “ 我们都成了美国人 ” 。
And so it was with most people in the Muslim world, who were as appalled as anyone else at the carnage of the terrorist attacks on Washington and New York.	大多数穆斯林世界的人也是如此，他们也和其他人一样对在华盛顿和纽约的恐怖主义大屠杀袭击感到震惊。
Indeed, when America responded to the attacks, almost no one mourned the fall of the Taliban, who were universally condemned for their fanaticism.	确实，当美国对袭击做出反应之时，几乎没有人哀悼塔利班的垮台。 塔利班的狂热主义受到全世界的谴责。
This unanimity of opinion no longer exists.	这种一致观点已经不复存在了。
In the five years since the attacks, two audiences for the so-called “war on terror” have emerged.	袭击发生后的五年时间里，出现了两种所谓的“反恐战争”观众。
Indeed, as the “war” progressed, the audience closest to the action began to see the emerging combat in a way that was diametrically opposed to that of the United States and the West.	确实，当“战争”进行之际，最为接近战场的观众开始以一种完全反对美国和西方的眼光看待正在呈现的战斗。
To the US administration, every act in the drama of the war on terror was seen as discrete and self-contained: Afghanistan, Iraq, Palestine, and Hezbollah in Lebanon.	对于美国当局而言，他们视发生在阿富汗、伊拉克、巴勒斯坦以及黎巴嫩的真主党的反恐战争的每个行动都是互不相关、各成一体的。
The Bush administration, having proclaimed a war on terror, invaded and occupied countries, and yet failed to see that these events were being linked in the eyes of people in the region.	布什政府向恐怖主义宣战，入侵并占领了不同的国家，但是却没有看到，中东地区的人民把这些事件连接了起来。
Glued to Al Jazeera and other Arab satellite channels, the various battles of the “war on terror” came to be viewed as a single chain of events in a grand plot against Islam.	他们目不转眼睛地观看半岛电视台和其他阿拉伯卫星频道，并把“反恐战争”中的各场战役视为针对伊斯兰惊天大阴谋中的系列事件。
Worse yet, America waved the banner of democracy as it prosecuted its wars.	更为糟糕的是，美国在开战之时摇晃民主的旗帜。
But hopes for democracy, be it secular or Islamist, for the people concerned have been buried in the rubble and carnage of Baghdad, Beirut, and Kandahar.	但是对于民主的希望，无论是世俗的还是伊斯兰式的，对于相关的国家人民而言都被埋葬在了巴格达、贝鲁特和坎大哈的瓦砾和屠杀之中。
Many Muslims understand – as well as anyone in the West, and in the same terms – the underlying causes of the alienation that animates Islamic radicalism and violence.	正如西方人士一样，许多穆斯林都理解促发伊斯兰极端主义和暴力的分离的根本原因。
They know that the rigid dictatorships of the region have paralyzed their populations.	他们知道该地区严酷的独裁统治让人民苦不堪言。
Only those consumed by the fires of their rage seem able to melt the shackles of these authoritarian societies.	只有那些怒火中烧的人才看起来能够熔化这些专制社会的枷锁。
But the price of escape is a kind of deformation.	但是，逃避的代价是某种畸形。
Embittered, fanatical, vengeful: those who rebel against the status quo enter the wider world seeking retaliation, not just against the regimes that deformed them, but against the West, which propped up the region’s authoritarians in the interest of “stability.”	那些反抗现状的人愤怒、狂热而且充满复仇心理。 他们进入更为广大的世界去寻求复仇，不仅仅是针对让他们畸形的政权，而且是为了“稳定”的利益而支持该地区独裁政权的西方世界。
Many Muslims also understand that the problem of Palestine, unsolved for three generations, goes beyond the suffering of the Palestinian people.	许多穆斯林还理解，历经三代人依然没有解决的巴勒斯坦问题范围要超出巴勒斯坦人民的苦难。
They know that the region’s dictators have used Palestine to justify their misrule and to avoid political and economic liberalization.	他们知道该地区的独裁者利用巴勒斯坦来为他们的恶劣治理提供理由并且避免政治和经济自由化。
So when America called for democracy, the hearts of many in the region soared with the hope that reform would come at last.	所以，当美国呼吁民主之时，该地区许多人心情高涨，希望改革终于来临。
But America, as so many times before, let them down.	但是，正如以往许多次那样，美国让他们失望。
As people at last began to hope for more liberal and decent societies, the US continued to endorse the regimes that were repressing them.	当人民最终开始希望自由和体面的社会时，美国继续支持压迫他们的政权。
America simply could not adhere to its own democracy-promotion script.	美国根本无法遵守其自身促进民主的说辞。
After the ouster of the Taliban in Afghanistan, the US turned its sights on the secular dictatorship of Saddam Hussein’s Iraq.	阿富汗塔利班倒台后，美国把目光转向萨达姆侯赛因在伊拉克的世俗专制统治。
Instead of encouraging reform of the Saudi/Wahhabi regime – the system that spawned 15 of the 19 hijackers in the 9/11 attacks – the average Muslim saw America as waging war on a regime that had nothing to do with that crime.	沙特瓦哈比政权体制产生了9/11袭击中19名劫机犯中的15人。 美国并没有鼓励该政权的改革，普通穆斯林民众认为美国在向一个与9/11犯罪毫无牵连的政权发动战争。
Many Muslims acquiesced in this deviation, viewing the invasion of Iraq as part of the passing of dictatorship and the coming of democracy.	许多穆斯林默许了这一偏离，他们认为入侵伊拉克是结束专制、迎来民主的一部分。
But the bloodstained shambles of the US occupation led America to abandon the quest for democracy.	但是，美国占领血迹斑斑，促使美国放弃对民主的追求。
The deeper America sank into the Iraqi quagmire, the more the US began to turn a blind eye to the region’s surviving dictators, particularly those in Saudi Arabia, Syria, Egypt, and Pakistan.	美国陷入伊拉克的泥潭越深，美国就越开始对该地区的独裁者视而不见，特别是沙特、叙利亚、埃及以及巴基斯坦。
Indeed, the last thing the region’s dictators wanted to see was a democratic Iraq.	确实，该地区独裁者最不愿意见到的就是一个民主的伊拉克。
Almost from the moment of Saddam’s fall, Saudi/Wahhabi jihadis poured into Iraq almost unimpeded.	几乎是从萨达姆倒台一开始，沙特瓦哈比圣战份子就毫无阻拦地涌入伊拉克。
Worse yet, the Muslims who supported the project to democratize Iraq widely suspect that the Sunni resistance that incited the Iraqi civil war has been financed by Saudi oil money. (Terrorism also kept Iraqi oil from becoming a serious challenger to Saudi Arabia.)	更为糟糕的是，支持民主化伊拉克的穆斯林广泛怀疑煽动伊拉克内战的逊尼派抵抗力量是由沙特的石油金钱资助的(恐怖主义还阻止伊拉克石油成为沙特阿拉伯的严重挑战 ) 。
So the effort to democratize Iraq – indeed, the entire American project to democratize the region – has fallen under deep suspicion by even the most moderate of Muslims.	因此民主化伊拉克、或曰美国民主化中东地区的工作受到了即使是大多数穆斯林温和派的深刻怀疑。
America, they believe, only wants a democracy that suits its interests.	他们相信，美国只是想要符合其利益的民主国家。
If Palestinians freely vote for Hamas, their choice is actively opposed.	如果巴勒斯坦人自由地选举哈马斯，那么，他们的选择就会遭到积极的反对。
Lebanon’s “Cedar Revolution,” which galvanized the West in the same way as Ukraine’s Orange Revolution, has been systematically undermined.	黎巴嫩的“雪松革命”就像乌克兰的橙色革命一样令西方振奋，但是却受到了系统化的破坏。
With democracy in most of the region still a long way off – indeed, perhaps a more distant prospect now than five years ago – US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice repeats her mantra that the dead civilians of Beirut, Sidon, Tyre, and Gaza represent the “birth pangs” of a new Middle East.	中东地区的民主依然遥不可期，与五年前相比，其前景更为遥远。 美国国务卿莱斯重复其祷文，即贝鲁特、西顿、提尔以及加沙的平民死亡代表的是新的中东分娩时的阵痛。
But until the West stops regarding dead babies as political props, we cannot understand how the Muslim world perceives all that has happened since September 11, 2001.	但是，直到��方停止把死婴看作政治道具之前，我们无法理解穆斯林世界如何看待2001年9月11日以来所发生的事件。
Only then will we understand why the unified view of five years ago has fractured so violently.	只有那时，我们才会理解为什么五年前的一致观点已经土崩瓦解。
	
Whose World Bank?	谁的世界银行？
NEW YORK – US President Barack Obama’s nomination of Jim Yong Kim for the presidency of the World Bank has been well received – and rightly so, especially given some of the other names that were bandied about.	纽约—美国总统奥巴马提名金辰勇为世界银行行长之举受到了广泛好评 — — 理应如此，特别是其他提名也已昭告天下之时。
In Kim, a public-health professor who is now President of Dartmouth College and previously led the World Health Organization’s HIV/AIDS department, the United States has put forward a good candidate.	金辰勇是公共卫生专家，现任达特茅斯大学校长，此前曾担任过世界卫生组织艾滋病部门。 这是一个相当好的候选人。
But the candidate’s nationality, and the nominating country – whether small and poor or large and rich – should play no role in determining who gets the job.	但候选人的国籍以及提名国 — — 不管是大是小、是穷是富 — — 不应该在人选决定中起到任何作用。
The World Bank’s 11 executive directors from emerging and developing countries have put forward two excellent candidates, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala of Nigeria and Jose Antonio Ocampo of Colombia.	世界银行的11名新兴和发展中国家执行董事已经提出了两位优秀的候选人：尼日利亚的奥孔乔-伊韦拉和哥伦比亚的奥坎波。
I have worked closely with both of them.	我和这两人都有过共事。
Both are first-rate, have served as ministers with multiple portfolios, have performed admirably in top positions in multilateral organizations, and have the diplomatic skills and professional competence to do an outstanding job.	两人都是第一流的人才，在多个部门担任过部长，在多边组织担任过要职且取得过令人称道的表现，也拥有出色胜任所需要的外交技能和职业素养。
They understand finance and economics, the bread and butter of the World Bank, and have a network of connections to leverage the Bank’s effectiveness.	他们懂金融和经济、明了世界银行的基本结构，也拥有能改善世行效率所需要的人脉。
Okonjo-Iweala brings an insider’s knowledge of the institution.	奥孔乔-伊韦拉很了解世界银行的内幕。
Ocampo, like Kim, brings the advantages and disadvantages of being an outsider; but Ocampo, a distinguished professor at Columbia University, is thoroughly acquainted with the World Bank.	奥坎波和金辰勇都是外部人士，这有利也有弊；但奥坎波作为哥伦比亚大学的杰出教授对世界银行是相当熟悉的。
He previously served not only as minister of economics and finance, but also of agriculture – a critically important qualification, given that the vast majority of the developing countries’ poor depend on farming.	他以前不但是经济和财政部长，也当过农业部长 — — 考虑到发展中国家的大部分穷人都得依靠务农生活，这是相当重要的资历。
He also brings impressive environmental credentials, addressing another of the Bank's central concerns.	他在环境方面也有令人印象深刻的经历，这契合世行的另一大关键职责。
Both Okonjo-Iweala and Ocampo understand the role of international financial institutions in providing global public goods.	奥孔乔-伊韦拉和奥坎波都明白国际金融机构在全球公共品供给方面的重要作用。
Throughout their careers, their hearts and minds have been devoted to development, and to fulfilling the World Bank’s mission of eliminating poverty.	在两人的职业生涯中，大量心血都奉献给了发展和完成世行消除贫困的任务。
They have set a high bar for any American candidate.	对于任何美国候选人，他们都是相当高的标杆。
Much is at stake.	需要考虑的方面很多。
Almost two billion people remain in poverty in the developing world, and, while the World Bank cannot solve the problem on its own, it plays a leading role.	发展中国家仍有20亿人口生活在贫困之中，世界银行不可能单枪匹马解决这个问题，但需要担起领导之责。
Despite its name, the Bank is primarily an international development institution.	世界银行虽然挂着一个“银行”的名字，但其主要职责是国际发展机构。
Kim’s specialty, public health, is critical, and the Bank has long supported innovative initiatives in this field.	金辰勇的专长 — — 公共卫生 — — 相当关键，世行产期以来也一直支持着该领域的创新活动。
But health is only a small part of the Bank’s “portfolio,” and it typically works in this area with partners who bring to the table expertise in medicine.	但卫生在世行的“组合”中只是一个次要部分，而且通常只是配合其他在医药领域领先的专业伙伴。
Rumors suggest that the US is likely to insist on maintaining the perverse selection process in which it gets to pick the World Bank’s president, simply because, in this election year, Obama’s opponents would trumpet loss of control over the choice as a sign of weakness.	各路消息表明，美国可能会坚持要求有悖常理的选人程序，坚持世行行长人选由它确定，这样做的唯一原因是2012是选举年，奥巴马的对手会将美国人不能问鼎世行行长宝座夸大为奥巴马示弱的表现。
And it is more important for the US to retain that control than it is for emerging and developing countries to obtain it.	此外，保持对该职位的控制之于美国要比获得该职位之于新兴和发展中国家更重要。
Indeed, the more powerful of the emerging markets know how to live within the current system, and they may use it to their advantage.	事实上，新兴市场中实力较强者知道如何在现有体系中生存，并能利用现有体系。
They will, in effect, obtain an IOU, to be cashed in for something that is more important.	它们可以获得一张白条，用之换取更加重要的东西。
The Realpolitik of the moment makes fighting over the presidency unlikely; America may well prevail.	眼下，现实政治已使得行长人选指正毫无悬念，美国人将最终获选。
But at what cost?	问题是代价多大。
Should America continue to insist on controlling the selection process, it is the Bank itself that would suffer.	如果美国坚持死握行长选择过程控制权不放，那么受害的将是世行自身。
For years, the Bank’s effectiveness was compromised because it was seen, in part, as a tool of Western governments and their countries’ financial and corporate sectors.	多年来，世界银行的效益一直受着牵累，因为它在一定程度上被视为是西方政府及其金融和公司部门的工具。
Ironically, even America’s long-term interests would be best served by a commitment – not just in words, but also in deeds – to a merit-based system and good governance.	讽刺的是，就算是从美国的长期利益出发，最优选择也是作出唯才是举、改善治理的承诺 — — 不仅仅是口头承诺，还要见诸实践。
One supposed achievement of the G-20 was an agreement to reform the governance of the international financial institutions – most importantly, how their leaders are selected.	G20的一个预期成果是达成关于国际金融机构治理改革的协议，其中最重要的部分就是领导人的选择。
Since expertise on development by and large lies within the emerging and developing countries – after all, they live development – it seems natural that the World Bank’s head would come from one of those countries.	如今，发展专家大体上都来自新兴和发展中国家 — — 毕竟，这些国家生活在发展中 — — 因此，世界银行行长应该出自这些国家中的一个似乎是理所当然的。
To maintain a cabal among developed countries, whereby the US appoints the World Bank president and Europe picks the International Monetary Fund’s head, seems particularly anachronistic and perplexing today, when the Bank and the Fund are turning to emerging-market countries as a source of funds.	维持发达国家的小算盘 — — 美国人把持世界银行、欧洲人把持IMF — — 在今天看来早已落后与时代，实在令人难以理解，因为世界银行和IMF正在日益依靠新兴市场作为资金来源。
While the US, the international community, and the Bank itself repeatedly emphasize the importance of good governance, a selection procedure that de facto leaves the appointment to the US president makes a mockery of it.	美国、国际社会和世界银行自身一再强调改善治理的重要性，但行长任命权实际归属美国总统这一事实让这一切看上去颇为可笑。
Okonjo-Iweala put the matter forcefully in an interview with the Financial Times: what is at stake is a matter of hypocrisy.	奥孔乔-伊韦拉在接受《金融时报》采访时强有力地批评了这一问题：一切充满了伪善。
The integrity of the advanced industrial countries, which have a majority of the votes at the World Bank, is being put to the test.	发达工业国 — — 它们在世界银行投票中占据着多数 — — 的团结度正在接受考验。
	
Who Should Be Helped First?	谁应当首先得到帮助？
The list of urgent challenges facing humanity is depressingly long.	人类面临的急迫挑战数不胜数。
AIDS, hunger, armed conflict, and global warming compete for attention alongside government failure, malaria, and the latest natural disaster.	艾滋病、饥荒、武装冲突以及全球气候变暖等问题与政府无能、霍乱以及新近的自然灾害等一道在争取人们的注意力。
While our compassion is great, our resources are limited.	尽管我们富有同情心，但是资源有限。
So who should be helped first?	那么，谁应当首先得到帮助呢？
To some, making such priorities seems obscene.	对于某些人来说，作出这样的优先顺序看起来是可憎的。
But the United Nations and national governments spend billions of dollars each year trying to help those in need without explicitly considering whether they are achieving the most that they can.	但是，联合国和各国政府每年开支数以几十亿美元试图帮助那些需要帮助的人们，却不明确考虑它们是否最大程度地实现了其所能实现的目标。
The western media focuses on a tsunami in Asia; donations flow freely.	西方媒体关注于亚洲的海啸；捐助源源而来。
An earthquake that devastates Pakistan garners fewer headlines, so the developed world gives a lot less.	一场摧毁巴基斯坦的地震并没有得到头条新闻报道，结果发达国家援助大为减少。
There is a better way.	我们可以有一个更好的办法。
We could prioritize our spending to achieve the greatest benefit for our money.	我们可以对我们的开支分清轻重缓急来达到最大效益。
This month, I will ask UN ambassadors how they would spend $50 billion to reduce suffering.	本月，我将询问驻联合国的大使们如何花费500亿美元来减少人类的痛苦。
They will repeat the same exercise that some of the world’s best economists tackled in a 2004 project called the “Copenhagen Consensus”: weighing up solutions to the great challenges facing the world, and deciding what should be done first.	他们将会重复当今某些最好的经济学家在2004年的一个被称为“哥本哈根共识”项目所作出的答案，那就是对世界面临的重大挑战作出评估，然后决定哪些事情应当优先处理。
But the question shouldn’t be left to politicians or Nobel laureates alone.	但是，这个问题不应当仅仅交给政客或者诺贝尔奖得主们解决。
We must all engage in the debate.	我们都应当参与到辩论中来。
One hopes that this task has been made slightly simpler by the publication of a book in which the Copenhagen Consensus economists boil down their insights.	哥本哈根共识经济学家们将他们的高见发表在一本专著之中，人们因此希望这一任务稍许变得简单一些。
Here’s one fact to consider: the entire death toll from the Southeast Asian tsunami is matched each month by the number of worldwide casualties of HIV/AIDS.	我们要考虑这样一个事实：全球每个月死于艾滋病的人数与东南亚国家海啸造成的整个死亡人数旗鼓相当。
A comprehensive prevention program providing free or cheap condoms and information about safe sex to the regions worst affected by HIV/AIDS would cost $27 billion and save more than 28 million lives.	一项完整的、向艾滋病影响最大的地区提供免费或者廉价避孕套和有关安全性行为信息的预防性项目可能花费270亿美元并且挽救2800万生命。
This, say the economists who took part in the Copenhagen Consensus, makes it the single best investment that the world could possibly make.	参与哥本哈根共识的经济学家们说，这是世界所可以作出的最佳投资。
The social benefits would outweigh the costs by 40 to one.	社会效益超出费用40倍。
Other options that the economists favored spending some of their $50 billion include providing micro-nutrients to the world’s hungry, establishing free trade, and battling malaria with mosquito nets and medication.	经济学家们倾向于花费部分500亿美元的其他选项还包括为世界饥饿人口提供微观营养、建立自由贸易以及使用蚊帐和药物与霍乱作斗争。
At the other end of the scale, responses to climate change like the Kyoto Protocol would cost more than they would achieve, so the economists crossed them off the list of things to do right now.	最后，类似京都议定书等对气候变化的对应措施得不偿失，所有经济学家们将它从优先清单中划掉。
Regardless of whether we agree with the economists, everybody must admit that we cannot do everything at once.	无论我们是否同意经济学家所言，每个人都必须承认，我们无法面面俱到。
Discussing our priorities is crucial.	讨论我们的优先项目很关键。
Often, politicians avoid prioritization.	政客们经常回避轻重缓急。
Why?	这是为什么呢？
The glib answer is because it is hard.	圆滑的解释是做起来很难。
There are many interested parties.	有许多利益相关方。
No group wants their solution to come last, and no government wants its country’s national challenges to be overlooked.	没有任何一个团体愿意让它们的方案排在最后，而且没有任何一个国家政府愿意让它们国家的挑战受到忽略。
The UN conference won’t be easy.	联合国会议不会轻而易举。
But it shows that there is a will to put prioritization squarely at the center of attention.	但是这表明，还是有意愿最大程度地关心轻重缓急的问题。
It will produce a “to do” list that will demonstrate how to achieve the most that we can for humanity, which could lead, in turn, to more transparent decision-making.	这将会产生一份待办事项清单。 这份清单将显示我们所能为人类做的最大最好的事情，而这样就会反过来导致更多透明化的决策。
The principles of economics provide a sound basis on which to make rational choices.	经济学原则为作出理性选择提供了坚实的基础。
Now, the discussion needs to shift from the academic sphere to political life.	现在，讨论应当从学术领域转移到政治生活。
It’s time for all of us to consider and compare our own priority lists.	现在已经是让我们考虑并比较我们自己的优先事项的时候了。
We must endeavor to shorten the list of challenges facing humanity.	我们必须努力缩短人类面临的挑战的清单。
But that requires all of us to engage in a debate about what we need to do first.	但是，这要求我们参加到有关哪些事情应当优先处理的辩论中来。
	
Who Should Lead the IMF?	谁该领导IMF？
BERKELEY – The International Monetary Fund, many say, has had a good crisis.	伯克利 — — 许多人说，国际货币基金组织（ IMF ）也曾遭遇过一场危机。
As recently as three years ago, many observers thought that the Fund had outlived its usefulness and should be closed down.	仅仅在三年前，颇有一些观察家认为，它已经失去作用，可以关门大吉了。
Since then, it has intervened in Hungary, Latvia, Iceland, and Ukraine, among other crisis-stricken countries – and has received a massive infusion of new resources.	但是后来，它先后介入了匈牙利、拉脱维亚、冰岛和乌克兰以及其他一些爆发危机的国家，并得到了新一轮大规模注资。
Part of the explanation for the higher esteem in which the IMF is now held is its recent display of intellectual flexibility – a rare virtue for a big, lumbering bureaucracy.	为什么 IMF 眼下如此炙手可热？ 部分的解释是它近来显示出一种变通精神 — — 对于一个庞大的官僚机构来说，这是一种难得的美德。
It has rethought its traditional opposition to capital controls.	它反思了传统上一贯秉持的反资本管制立场。
It has suggested that central banks may want to consider higher inflation targets in order to avoid hitting the zero bound in the event of deflationary shocks. For this, it drew a stern reproach from Germany’s Bundesbank – a clear sign that it is doing something right.	它建议各国央行考虑调高通胀目标，以免在通缩冲击下，降息时过快触及零利率底线，由此，它遭到了来自德国央行的强烈反对，而这恰恰说明它的主张是正确的。
The IMF has also put in place a Flexible Credit Line to disburse funds quickly – and free of onerous conditions – to countries buffeted by financial crosswinds through no fault of their own.	IMF 还推出了“灵活信贷额度 ” （ FCL ）以便快速划拨资金，资助那些在金融风暴中无辜受难的国家，而且不带附加条件。
The problem is that, despite its alluring name, the new facility has had few takers, and no Asian takers in particular.	不过，尽管这个新工具的名字听上去很有吸引力，但是目前接受者寥寥，尤其是没有亚洲国家提出申请。
Indeed, it is revealing that when South Korea was desperate for dollars following the failure of Lehman Brothers, it borrowed from the United States Federal Reserve, not from the Fund.	在雷曼兄弟倒闭后那一段时间，韩国极度需要美元，但它跑去向美联储借款，而没有向 IMF 求助，这很能说明问题。
After their experience in 1997-1998, Korean policymakers would sooner jump off a cliff than borrow, even without conditions, from the IMF.	自从有了 1997~1998 年的不快经验以后，韩国政府宁可从悬崖上跳下去，也不愿向 IMF 借钱，哪怕不附带任何条件。
Nevertheless, while not all is sweetness and light, there has been progress.	尽管有这些小插曲， IMF 还是取得了长足的进步。
And for this the IMF’s strong, politically astute management – not exactly something from which the Fund has regularly benefited in recent years – deserves credit.	它那强有力的、政治上不乏精明的管理层理应得到好评 — — 这样的管理层近年来并不多见。
Now, however, the rumor mill is heating up with gossip that the Fund’s managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, will leave in order to oppose Nikolas Sarkozy in the 2012 French presidential elections.	然而，眼下正有传言，说 IMF 总裁多米尼克·施特劳斯 — 卡恩打算卸任，参加 2012 年法国总统大选，跟萨尔科齐一角高低。
Sarkozy’s popularity is hitting new lows, and Strauss-Kahn’s friends say that he has never made a secret of his political ambitions.	萨尔科齐的支持率屡创新低。 施特劳斯 — 卡恩的朋友则说，他从不隐瞒自己从政的抱负。
A lame-duck managing director would hamstring the Fund.	如果卡恩真的去意已定，成了“跛鸭”总裁，那会削弱 IMF 的影响力。
Already there is a sense that the IMF is reluctant to tell Europe more forcefully how to handle its problem with Greece because the managing director must be careful to avoid meddling in Europe’s internal politics.	已经有人在揣测，说 IMF 之所以不愿更高调地介入希腊危机，就是因为总裁必须小心翼翼地避免卷入欧洲内部的政治纠葛。
On top of this now comes the interesting news that the IMF has appointed Zhu Min, previously a deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China, as special adviser to Strauss-Kahn.	在这种背景下，最近又传出新闻，说 IMF 任命中国人民银行副行长朱民为总裁特别顾问。
Zhu will thus be part of the core management team.	朱民成为 IMF 核心管理团队的一员。
This, in turn, has fueled speculation that Zhu will be a candidate to become the next managing director.	这引得外界纷纷猜测，朱民将成为 IMF 下一总裁的一个人选。
It is the turn of someone from outside Europe to head the IMF – Europe having had a monopoly on the position since the Fund was created following World War II.	有人说，是时候让欧洲之外的人士来坐这个位子了。 自第二次世界大战后 IMF 成立以来，欧洲人就垄断了 IMF 总裁这一职位。
The bargain then was that the US could pick the president of the World Bank while the Europeans would get the top slot at the IMF (US policymakers in their wisdom believing that the Bank would become the more important institution).	当时欧美达成了一个默契，美国人当世界银行行长，欧洲人当 IMF 总裁（当年美国的决策者自以为是地认为世界银行会成为两者之中更重要的国际组织 ） 。
But today’s world is more multi-polar. It is no longer dominated by the Atlantic economies, so those economies should no longer dictate who holds the top jobs at the two Bretton Woods institutions.	但当今世界已是个多极化的世界，它再也不是大西洋两岸的经济体所主导的那个世界了，因此，这些经济体也不应该继续垄断布雷顿森林体系里最重要的两个机构的领导职位。
It is now, the argument goes, another region’s turn.	有人由此推论说，应该轮到其他地区来分享权力了。
The obvious choice is Asia, home to the most dynamic emerging markets.	亚洲当是首选，因为世界上最有活力的几大新兴市场经济体都位于这片大陆。
It is the region to which the world’s economic center of gravity is shifting.	世界经济的重心正在向这一地区移动。
If you ask Asian leaders what would make them consider again approaching the Fund after their traumatic experience with IMF “assistance” in 1997-1998, they will answer: an Asian managing director.	如果你问亚洲各国领导人，在��了 1997~1998 年 IMF “援助”的“创伤记忆”之后，怎么才能让他们再次考虑向 IMF 求助，他们会回答：除非 IMF 有个亚洲人当总裁。
In fact, this is precisely the wrong way to think about the problem.	可实际上，这种思考方式恰恰是错的。
The IMF’s problem in the past has been parochialism and lack of accountability.	IMF 过去的问题是狭隘和不负责任。
The best way to ensure that the Fund remains open to new ideas is by selecting the person with the best ideas to lead it.	要确保改革后的 IMF 保持开放心态，容纳新思想，最好的办法是选择最有头脑的人去领导它。
The best way to ensure that the IMF’s management is accountable to all of its governmental shareholders is to prevent the top job from becoming the sinecure of any region, whether Europe or Asia.	要让它保持对各方负责的态度，最好的办法也是不要让总裁职位成为 任何 地区的禁脔，不论是欧洲还是亚洲。
The next managing director should be selected on the merits, not on the basis of nationality.	下一任 IMF 总裁的推选标准应当是能力，而不是国籍。
There should be an open competition, in which the best candidate wins on the basis of his or her ideas.	应当允许公开竞争，让提出最好理念的最佳候选人胜出。
Asia has plenty of competent economic officials who might be considered as the next managing director of the IMF. But just because they are Asian is not reason enough to select them.	亚洲有很多能力很强的经济官员，都值得考虑作为下任 IMF 总裁的人选。 但如果要选择他们中的任何一个人，都不应仅仅因为他 / 她是亚洲人。
	
Prepping Gay Men for PrEP	让男同性恋了解PrEP
LONDON – In October, two groups researching the effectiveness of a potential breakthrough drug in the fight against HIV did something unusual.	伦敦 — — 10月，在抗击艾滋病工作中研究某种潜在突破性药物的两个小组取得了非同寻常的突破。
They announced that the therapy they were testing, an antiretroviral drug called Truvada, had proved effective enough to end the randomized phases of the trials, and that they were offering the pill to all of the studies’ participants.	他们宣布已证实测试对象抗逆转录药物“特鲁瓦达”的效果足以通过随机阶段试验，他们目前正将此药品提供给所有的试验参与者。
The researchers found that gay men who take Truvada, in addition to using condoms when they have sex, were significantly less likely to contract HIV.	研究人员发现服用特鲁瓦达的男同性恋若能在性行为中配合使用避孕套，将大幅降低感染艾滋病毒的风险。
This is further evidence of the effectiveness of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a technique by which people who are HIV-negative use antiretroviral drugs to protect themselves from infection.	这进一步证实了接触前预防（PrEP）技术的有效性，该技术旨在让艾滋病毒测试阴性者利用抗逆转录病毒药物保护自己远离感染威胁。
In 2011, a trial funded by the Gates Foundation found that straight couples using Truvada reduced the risk of transmitting HIV by 73%.	2011年，由盖茨基金会资助的一项试验发现服用特鲁瓦达的异性恋夫妇感染艾滋病毒的风险降低了73 % 。
Those fighting to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS thus have a new tool in their arsenal.	为防止艾滋病毒/艾滋病传播而奋斗的人终于有了新工具来充实自己的武器库。
The question now is how best to deliver it to those who need it most: gay men in developing countries.	现在的问题是如何才能更好地交给那些最需要的人：生活在发展中国家的男同性恋。
This summer, the World Health Organization took an important step to that end, recommending PrEP for all gay men and men who have sex with men, making it the first major international health organization to do so.	今年夏天，世卫组织为实现这一目标迈出了重要的一步，向所有男同性恋及男同性性行为群体推荐PrEP，从而成为首家采取上述措施的重要国际卫生机构。
The WHO estimates that increased use of PrEP could reduce HIV infections by up to 25% over the next decade among men who have sex with men (this category includes anyone with elevated risk, not just those who identify as gay).	世卫组织预测扩大使用PrEP可以在今后十年男同性性行为群体中减少高达25%的艾滋病毒感染（该群体囊括了所有高风险个体，而不只是已经明确的男同性恋 ） 。
But an important obstacle remains: the legal predicament of gay men in much of the developing world.	但多数发展中国家男同性恋法律困境等重要障碍依然存在。
In countries like Nigeria, where anti-homosexuality legislation has recently been approved, those following the WHO’s new PrEP guidelines could find themselves subject to imprisonment.	像尼日利亚这样的国家刚刚批准了反同性恋立法，导致执行世卫组织PrEP新规者可能为此遭受监禁的威胁。
The climate of officially sanctioned homophobia in Nigeria has already set back the fight against AIDS.	官方认可的尼日利亚恐同氛围已经破坏了抗击艾滋病斗争的成果。
In 2006, a study found that 13% of men who have sex with men in Nigeria were HIV-positive, compared to 4.5% of all Nigerians.	2006年， 一项研究发现尼日利亚男同性性交群体13%的人艾滋病毒测试呈阳性，而该数据在尼全体民众中仅有4.5 % 。
By 2012, the HIV rate among men who have sex with men had jumped to 17%.	截止2012年，男同性性交群体中的艾滋病毒感染率已经上升至17 % 。
Meanwhile, an increasing number of men reported encountering homophobia at healthcare centers, making them less likely to seek help.	此外，报告在医疗中心遭遇同性恋恐惧症的人越来越多，使他们寻求治疗的积极性大打折扣。
The consequences could not be more serious.	这样的后果严重到了极点。
Two years ago, a young HIV-positive Nigerian man contacted me on Facebook to tell me about his monthly ordeal at the clinic.	两年前，一位艾滋病毒测试呈阳性的尼日利亚男青年在Facebook上与我联系，向我讲述了他每个月在诊所经受的折磨。
The nurse at the hospital spent more time lecturing him on the evils of homosexuality than telling him about the drugs he was taking and their possible side effects.	医院的护士长篇大论地向他讲述同性恋的罪恶，而不是向他解释所服的药物和药物可能的副作用。
The man, a third-year medical student, told me that he had decided to stop going to the clinic.	这位男青年当时是医学院三年级学生，他告诉我他决定不再去诊所接受治疗。
When I asked how he would continue treatment, he said that he had a friend abroad who could get him the drugs.	我问他他想如何继续接受治疗，他说他在国外有朋友，可能帮他买药。
Less than two years later, I saw a Facebook update announcing his death.	不到两年后，我看到Facebook上的一条新信息宣布了他的死讯。
My Facebook friend is not the only one who has paid the price for Nigeria’s homophobia.	我在Facebook上的朋友并不是为尼日利亚恐同氛围付出代价的唯一一个。
A preliminary report from the Solidarity Alliance Nigeria, a coalition of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) organizations, details a huge decrease in the use of HIV services by men who have sex with men in the six months following the enactment of the anti-gay legislation.	尼日利亚团结联盟是由男女同性恋、双性恋和变性人（LGBT）组织组成的联盟机构，其初步报告详细说明了反同性恋法出台六个月后在男同性性行为群体中使用HIV服务的人大幅减少。
The decrease ranges from 40% in Lagos – Nigeria’s most cosmopolitan city – to 70% in Kano, a predominantly Muslim state.	具体降幅从尼日利亚最国际化城市拉各斯的40%到以穆斯林为主的卡诺州的70%不等。
Nigerians living with HIV must do more than just fight the infection; they also must brave social stigma, weather discrimination by secular and religious institutions, and now, potentially, face threats from the legal system.	尼日利亚的艾滋病毒感染者不仅要对抗感染；还必须承受来自社会的羞辱、面对世俗和宗教机构歧视的目光。 现在，他们还有可能面临来自法律系统的威胁。
In this environment, the promise of PrEP begins to dim, as the risks of seeking treatment outweigh the potentially life-saving benefits.	在这样的环境下， PrEP的前景开始变得暗淡，因为潜在的治疗收益抵不过寻求治疗所带来的风险。
The story is similar in Uganda.	乌干达的状况也与此相似。
Last spring, as legal persecution of gays there mounted, the government raided an HIV clinic and withheld its operating license for providing care and support to HIV-positive men who have sex with men.	去年春天，随着对同性恋法律迫害的升级，政府突击检查了一家为男同性性交群体HIV阳性患者提供医疗服务及支持的艾滋病诊所并暂扣了其营业执照。
As an African activist with more than ten years of experience in the fight against HIV, I hope that the WHO will build on its important first step of advising the use of PrEP.	作为在抗击HIV领域有10余年经验的非洲活动家，我希望世卫组织能在迈出建议使用PrEP这关键一步的基础上更上一层楼。
That means initiating a public conversation with countries like Nigeria, Uganda, Gambia, and Russia on the importance of inclusion in the battle against HIV.	这意味着就包容对抗击HIV病毒斗争的重要性方面与尼日利亚、乌干达、冈比亚和俄罗斯等国家展开公众对话。
The WHO should make it clear that while it may not be advocating for LGBT political rights, it is determined to ensure that all those who can benefit from PrEP are able to access the necessary drugs, without fear of legal consequences.	世卫组织应该明确表态虽然它或许并不宣扬男女同性恋、双性恋和变性人（LGBT）的政治权利，但却有决心确保能从PrEP中受益的所有人都能获得必须的药品，而不必担心可能的法律后果。
Researchers, drug companies, and human-rights campaigners must take up the fight to ensure that PrEP is made available – without risk – to those who need it most.	研究人员、制药公司和人权活动家必须担负起确保 PrEP能够普及的斗争责任 — — 让最需要的群体不冒任何风险就能得到它。
	
Who’s Who on Putin’s Payroll?	普京的工资单花名册
MOSCOW – Germany’s ex-Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is a legend in Russia.	莫斯科 — — 德国前总理格哈德·施罗德在俄罗斯是个传奇人物。
He serves Gazprom’s interests for a measly couple of million euros a year, sits in at sessions of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and writes books about his staunch friendship with “Genosse Wladimir,” who, in the not-so-distant past, earned himself the well-deserved nickname of “Stasi” among business circles in gangster-ridden St. Petersburg.	他为挣得区区每年数百万欧元的酬金替俄罗斯天然气公司工作，列席俄罗斯科学院召集的会议，并写书称颂他与“弗拉基米尔同志”之间忠诚的友谊，而后者就在不算太远的过去，还在完全由歹徒控制的圣彼得堡企业界当之无愧地赢得了的“东德秘密警察 ” （ Stasi）的浑名。
But it is not immediately obvious whether it is Schroeder licking Putin’s boots nowadays or vice versa.	不过现在究竟是施罗德对普京俯首听命还是情况恰恰相反似乎并不清楚。
The two of them are building, or trying to build, the Nord Stream gas pipeline, an exceptionally costly project that satisfies twin strategic objectives.	这两人正在建设、或者说设法建设服务于双重战略目标的造价极端高昂的北溪（Nord Stream）输气管线。
Demonstratively hostile to the interests of both Belarus and Ukraine, the pipeline is intended to ensure that these countries are under Russia’s energy thumb, regardless of who is in power in Minsk and Kiev.	这项工程将威胁到白俄罗斯和乌克兰两国的利益，这条管线目的是确保无论明斯克和基辅由谁来当政，这两个国家都完全受制于俄罗斯的能源。
As a bonus, the pipeline will also consolidate the Russian economy’s status as an appendage of Germany’s – its supplier of natural resources.	附带的好处是这条管线将进一步巩固俄国经济相对于德国的附属地位 — — 俄国是德国自然资源的供应商。
Certain of Schroeder’s predecessors as German chancellor sought to attain the same objective by rather different means.	在施罗德之前任职的某些德国总理曾试图通过完全不同的手段达到同样的目标。
The Kremlin’s achievements in securing the help of Americans willing to offer their influence are equally impressive.	克里姆林在争取有影响力的美国人帮助方面也同样成绩斐然。
Indeed, the Obama administration’s Russia policy is being nurtured with advice from people who have no official position in the administration but close business ties to Russia and the Kremlin: Henry Kissinger, James A. Baker, Thomas Graham, and Dimitri Simes.	事实上，影响奥巴马政府对俄政策的人士很多并未在政府中正式任职，而是与俄国和克里姆林有着千丝万缕的商业关系：亨利·基辛格、詹姆斯·A·贝克、托马斯·格雷厄姆和迪米特里·西门斯。
The first two are major geo-politicians; Graham and Simes are respected as outstanding Russia specialists.	前两位是著名的地缘政治家，格雷厄姆和西门斯则是作为杰出的俄罗斯专家而倍受尊敬。
They write key reports for the administration, and shuttle between Moscow and Washington, coordinating the parameters of the Obama administration’s effort to “reset” the bilateral relationship.	他们为政府起草关键报告，在莫斯科和华盛顿之间穿梭往返，对奥巴马政府“重塑”双边关系努力的各项参数进行协调。
Like Schroeder, all these people are not economically disinterested.	像施罗德一样，这些人在经济利益方面并非没有私心。
Baker is a consultant for the two companies at the commanding heights of the Russian economy, Gazprom and Rosneft.	贝克在占领俄国经济制高点的俄罗斯天然气公司和俄罗斯石油公司担任顾问。
The Kissinger Associates lobbying group, whose Russian section is headed by Graham, feeds in to the Kissinger-Primakov working group, a quasi-private-sector effort, blessed by Putin, to deepen ties between Russia and the United States.	而基辛格顾问公司游说团的俄罗斯分部则由格雷厄姆领导，为基辛格－普里马科夫工作组提供服务，这是一股受到普京庇护的准私人力量，以深化俄美两国之间的关系为目标。
It is highly instructive to read the recommendations of these people and groups, as they unobtrusively render the objectives of their Kremlin clients into a language familiar to American leaders.	阅读上述人士及组织的建议非常发人深省，因为他们谨慎地把克里姆林客户的目标翻译成与美国领导人相似的语言表达。
Graham’s latest contribution, “Resurgent Russia and US Purposes,” is most revealing in this respect.	格雷厄姆的最新贡献 ， “ 复兴的俄罗斯和美国目标”在这方面最具启迪作用。
The author finds the government of a “Russia getting up off its knees” to consist of progressive modernizers fully aware of the challenges facing their country as it attempts to “return to the great powers club.”	作者发现“站起来的俄国”政府由进步的改革人士构成，这些人对国家面临的挑战具有清醒的认识，并企图“重返大国俱乐部 ” 。
“In order to become a genuinely developed and modern country,” Graham continues, “in the coming decade Russia will need to invest at least one trillion dollars in modernizing its infrastructure.	“为了成为真正意义上的发达现代化国家 ， ” 格雷厄姆继续写道 ， “ 俄罗斯在今后十年中需要投入至少1万亿美元，用于实现基础设施现代化。
America and the West in general have a vital interest in seeing the modernization of Russia succeed.	美国和西方一般来讲愿意目睹俄国现代化取得成功。
The lion's share of the technologies, know-how, and a substantial proportion of the investment, needs to come from Europe and the USA.”	这里面最大部分的技术、诀窍和占很大比例的投资都需要来自欧洲和美国 。 ”
In addition to the technology and investments, Graham quietly slips in a foreign policy suggestion for the Obama administration that is sure to please the Kremlin: “Finlandizing” Ukraine.	除去技术和投资以外，格雷厄姆还在不知不觉间为奥巴马政府提出了外交政策建议，这个建议肯定非常符合克林姆林的胃口：即实现乌克兰的“芬兰化 ” 。
Unless that sort of appeasement is pursued, he warns, Russia will continue to oppose the US “wherever and whenever it can.”	他警告除非采取这样的缓和政策，俄罗斯将会继续“在任何可能的时间和地点”对抗美国。
According to Graham, “At the extreme, a weak Russia, with its vast resources and sparse population east of the Urals, could become the object of competition among the great powers, notably China and the United States.”	按照格雷厄姆的说法 ， “ 一个衰落的俄罗斯至多可以凭借乌拉尔以东稀少的人口及其广袤的资源成为大国，尤其是中美两国争夺的对象 。 ”
That unspoken help-us-develop-or-we’ll-let-the-Chinese-do-it threat is a logical development of Prime Minister Putin’s homily at this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos, where he advocated decisive action to end the world economic crisis.	这种“帮助我们发展否则我们就求助于中国人”的隐含威胁是普京总理在今年达沃斯世界经济论坛说教的合乎逻辑的发展，他在达沃斯论坛上倡议采取果断行动，结束世界经济危机。
His recipe?	你问他的办法？
Western countries should write off half a trillion dollars’ worth of debt owed to them by the Russian state corporations run by his pals from the Dresden KGB and the Ozero dacha cooperative.	西方国家应当取消由他的好友管理的德累斯顿克格勃和Ozero dacha合作企业所欠下的价值5千亿美元的债务。
But no amount of money will succeed in modernizing Putin's kleptocratic regime, which has already squandered trillions in oil wealth.	可是多少钱都无法实现普京窃国政权的现代化，他们已经挥霍了数万亿美元的石油财富。
Simply put, the Putin system is politically, institutionally, and intellectually antithetical to the task of modernization.	简言之，普京的制度无论在政治、制度还是知识结构上都与现代化的目标背道而驰。
Graham’s only error in his presentation is his attempt to frighten the administration with a hypothetical confrontation between the US and China over Russian resources.	格雷厄姆在表述中���唯一错误就是企图用美中争夺俄罗斯资源的对峙假设来恐吓政府。
This is not his area of specialization.	这超出了他的专业范畴。
Kissinger works personally with the Chinese account, jointly propounding with his long-time rival Zbigniew Brzezinski the notion, so seductive for an America growing weary of its imperial burden, of a global Big Two.	基辛格与中国客户有不少私人接触，他与自己的长期对手兹比格涅夫·布热津斯基共同提出了一种学说，这对越来越厌倦帝国负担及全球两大国现状的美国很有吸引力。
Here is a recent sample of Kissinger’s geopolitical arts: “The role of China in a new world order is crucial.	下面是基辛格地缘政治艺术的最新范例 ： “ 中国在新世界秩序中的作用至关重要。
A relationship that started on both sides as essentially a strategic design to constrain a common adversary has evolved over the decades into a pillar of the international system... The Sino-American relationship needs to be taken to a new level.	双方发展出来的限制共同对手的战略设计实质已在近几十年间演变为国际体系的基石…中美关系需要上升到新的层次。
This generation of leaders has the opportunity to shape relations into a design for a common destiny, much as was done with trans-Atlantic relations in the post-war period.”	就像二战结束后的跨大西洋关系一样，这一代领导人有机会缔造同呼吸共命运的新美中关系 。 ”
No doubt Kissinger believes every word he wrote, but his ideas also honestly articulate the aspirations of his customers.	无疑基辛格相信自己写下的每一个字，不过他的理念也忠实地表达了客户的愿望。
It’s just that not all customers have the same motives.	但问题是并非所有客户都抱有完全相同的动机。
One wants to get his hooks into a further trillion dollars that it can pick away at, while the other wants to become “a central construct of the system of international relations.”	他们有的人想要再侵吞1万亿美元，以供今后慢慢挥霍，而其他人则想要成为“国际关系系统的核心要素 。 ”
But, in both cases, the customers are getting the influence for which they are paying.	但无论动机如何，这些客户为购买影响力所花的每一分钱都可谓物有所值。
	
Who Wants Peace in the Middle East?	谁希望中东和平？
Forty years after the Six Day War peace between Israelis and Palestinians seems as distant as ever.	在六日战争四十年以后，以色列人和巴勒斯坦人之间的和平似乎依然像过去一样遥不可及。
Israel still refuses to accept the new Palestinian national unity government as a negotiating partner because Hamas is part of that government.	以色列依然拒绝接受新的巴勒斯坦民族团结政府作为谈判对手，因为哈马斯是那个政府的一部分。
What is the cause of this seeming paradox?	这个看上去有些自相矛盾的事情的原委是什么呢？
Is there any hope?	还存在希望吗？
The Palestinian government is united administratively, but divided politically.	巴勒斯坦政府只是在行政上是联合的，但是在政治上却是分裂的。
The Palestinians have one government with two policies.	巴勒斯坦人的政府有着两种政策。
Politically, Palestine’s Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh remains against recognizing Israel and respecting the existing agreements.	在政治上，巴勒斯坦总理哈尼亚依然拒绝承认以色列以及尊重已有的协议。
He declared that he is for the continuation of resistance in all forms.	他宣称他支持继续进行所有形式的抵抗。
What kind of guarantee of a good faith effort to reach a peace agreement can come from such a stance?	对于一个持这样立场的人，有谁能保证他会以真诚的努力去达成一项和平协议呢？
That is the question the European Union needs to ask itself as it debates whether to resume providing financial aid to the Palestinian Authority.	这正是欧盟在争论是否应该恢复对巴勒斯坦权力机构的经济援助时应该问自己的问题。
The EU should make it clear to Hamas that the Union is not going to finance terror and is not going to finance a refusal to make peace.	欧盟应该明确地向哈马斯表明它不会资助恐怖活动，也不会援助拒绝达成和平。
If the Palestinians want to have European help – which I support completely – it must be ready to make peace, not to break peace.	如果巴勒斯坦人想得到欧洲的帮助，对此我完全表示支持，那么它必须准备好达成和平，而不是破坏和平。
After all, it is not Hamas as a party that is objectionable; what is objectionable are the politics and policies which Hamas pursues.	不管怎样，应该反对的不是作为一个政党的哈马斯，而是哈马斯遵循的政治和政策。
We have nothing against Hamas; we are against their belligerent policies, which service in government has not changed.	我们对哈马斯并不抱有成见，我们反对的是它好战的政策，这种政策在它加入政府后依然没有改变。
There was a time when the PLO held positions that were the same as those of Hamas.	过去巴解组织的立场曾经是和哈马斯是一样的。
Then the PLO changed.	此后巴解组织改变了它的立场。
If the current Palestinian leadership changes its position, there will be no problem from our side.	如果现在的巴勒斯坦领导层也改变它的立场的话，我们这面是绝对没有问题的。
We will have nothing against negotiations. We are for negotiations.	我们绝对不会反对通过谈判解决问题，我们赞成谈判。
We are for the “two-state solution.”	我们赞成“两国方案 ” 。
We accept the Middle East “road map.”	我们接受中东“路线图 ” 。
What we are against is terror.	我们反对的是恐怖主义。
Where we cannot agree, however, is on a “right of return” for Palestinians.	然而，我们所不能同意的，是巴勒斯坦人有“回归的权利 ” 。
If such a right were recognized, there would be a Palestinian majority instead of a Jewish majority, which would mean the end of the Jewish state.	如果接受这种权利，巴勒斯坦人就会取代犹太人成为多数，而这意味着犹太国家的终结。
This is a demographic, not a religious, question: an Arab state is where the Arabs are the majority, and the Jewish state is where the Jews are the majority.	这是一个人口的问题，而不是一个宗教的问题：一个阿拉伯国家应该是阿拉伯人占据多数，而犹太人的国家应该是犹太占据多数。
Indeed, the “right of return” contradicts the very idea of a two-state solution, as it would mean one state – a Palestinian state.	事实上 ， “ 回归的权利”正是与两国方案相抵触的，因为它将意味着只有一个国家，即巴勒斯坦国家。
Nobody in Israel will accept this.	没有哪个以色列人会接受这一点。
But there are other problems in the region that Israel – and the world – must face.	但是在这个地区还有其他的一些问题是以色列以及全世界必须要面对的。
The Palestinians’ current unity government resulted from Saudi mediation, which came in response mainly to Iran’s ambition to increase its influence, not only in Iraq, but also in Lebanon, Gaza, and the West Bank.	巴勒斯坦当前的联合政府来自沙特的调解，而这主要是出于对伊朗想不仅是在伊拉克，还包括黎巴嫩、加沙和西岸增强其影响力的野心的回应。
Of course, that issue is completely outside Israel’s control.	当然，这个问题完全不在以色列的控制范围之内。
The ongoing fight in the Muslim world between Sunnis and Shi’a recalls the struggle between Protestants and Catholics in seventeenth-century Europe.	穆斯林世界逊尼派和什叶派之间正在进行的斗争令人回想起十七世纪欧洲发生在新教徒与天主教派之间的战争。
So it is little wonder that the Saudis, Jordanians, Egyptians, and the Gulf states are seeking to resist Iran’s hegemonic ambitions in the region.	所以不难想象沙特人、约旦人、埃及人以及海湾国家都在努力寻求抵制伊朗在该地区的霸权野心。
Nevertheless, the stakes are far higher than in the seventeenth century, because Iran represents a threat that combines a fanatic religion with a determination to acquire nuclear weapons.	然而，现在的利害关系要远比十七世纪时严重得多，因为伊朗人所代表的威胁融合了狂热的宗教和获得核武器的决心。
Indeed, Iran is the only country that openly declares its desire to destroy another member of the United Nations.	事实上，伊朗是唯一一个公开宣称要毁灭联合国的另一个成员国的国家。
That is a threat that every country is obliged to take seriously.	这样的一种威胁是任何一个国家都必须严肃对待的。
When a country’s president delivers crazy speeches, denies the Holocaust, and does not hide his ambition to control the Middle East, who can guarantee that the threat is not serious?	当一个国家的总统发表疯狂的演讲，拒绝承认二战期间纳粹对犹太人的大屠杀的存在，并且丝毫不掩饰他控制整个中东地区的野心，谁能保证这样的一种威胁不是真的呢？
The issue is not one of restoring nuclear “balance” to the Middle East, as Iran’s leaders maintain.	问题并不是伊朗的领导人所一再声称的要恢复中东地区的核“平衡 ” 。
First of all, Israel does not threaten anybody.	首先，以色列并不威胁任何人。
Israel never said that it wants to destroy Iran; Israel never openly proclaimed that it would enrich uranium and build nuclear bombs in order to destroy another country.	以色列从未说过它想要毁灭伊朗这样的话；以色列从未公开宣称它要进行浓缩油活动以及制造核弹头以摧毁另一个国家。
On the contrary, Israel has said that it will not be the first to use nuclear weapons in the Middle East.	恰恰相反，以色列表态说它绝不会在中东首先使用核武器。
But that does not mean that we can afford to ignore an obvious threat from countries that want to destroy us.	但是那并不意味着我们会对来自其他国家的想要毁灭我们的明显威胁置之不理。
Despite the current unfavorable situation, the path to stabilizing the Middle East still leads through joint economic projects.	尽管面对目前不利的局面，稳定中东之路依然通过联合经济计划在延续着。
Even now, Israel is planning to build a new “corridor of peace,” which will comprise the Jordanians, the Palestinians, and us.	甚至现在，以色列正在计划建立一条新的“和平走廊 ” ， 它将包含约旦人、巴勒斯坦人还有我们。
Within the framework of this project, we are seeking to halt the dehydration of the Dead Sea, build a joint airport and a joint water network with Jordan, and develop tourism infrastructure, at a cost of up to $5 billion.	在这个计划的框架内，我们正寻求制止死海的脱水化、与约旦建造一个联合机场和联合水网，开发旅游基础设施，其总成本高达50亿美元。
We have the donors, so there is no shortage of money to finance our efforts, which, I am sure, will be realized.	我们有捐献资金的人，所以我们的努力不会出现资金短缺的现象，而我相信，我们的努力一定能够实现。
Israel wants – indeed, desperately needs – peace and stability in the Middle East, and we will continue to do everything in our power to achieve it.	以色列非常非常希望看到中东地区的和平与稳定，而我们将继续尽我们的一切努力去实现这一点。
But we cannot reach that goal alone, much less negotiate with those whose idea of a stable and peaceful Middle East is one that has no place for Israel.	但是我们无法单靠我们自己去实现这一目标，更无法通过与那些在他们有关一个稳定与和平的中东的概念中并没有以色列的位置的人谈判去实现这一目标。
	
Who Will Eclipse America?	谁将压倒美国?
WASHINGTON, DC – According to Voltaire, the Roman Empire fell “because all things fall.”	发自华盛顿特区 — — 伏尔泰曾说，罗马帝国的崩溃是因为“一切都崩溃了 ” 。
It is hard to argue with this as a general statement about decline: nothing lasts forever. But it is also not very useful.	当然我们还可以用“没有什么是永恒的”这句话来解释国家的衰落，但这句话同时也没什么实际意义。
In thinking, for example, about American predominance in the world today, it would be nice to know when it will decline, and whether the United States can do anything to postpone the inevitable.	但如果在思考美国当今的世界霸权时能够知道它何时衰落，而美国又能采取哪些方法延缓这一进程，就再好不过了。
Contemporary commenters despaired of the Roman Empire for several hundred years before it finally collapsed.	当今的评论家们都对罗马帝国在崩溃前依然维持了数百年而感到绝望。
Could America find its way to a similar extension?	那么美国又能否找到类似这样延长其支配地位的途径？
In terms of providing an essential structure for discussion of this problem, Arvind Subramanian’s new book, Eclipse: Living in the Shadow of China’s Economic Dominance, is a major contribution.	而在为该问题提供一个可供讨论的必要框架方面，阿尔文·苏布拉曼尼恩的新书《日食：生活在中国经济霸权的阴影之下》做出了一个重要贡献。
(Full disclosure: Subramanian and I are colleagues at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and we have worked together on other issues.)	（信息披露：苏布拉曼尼恩与笔者都在美国彼得森国际经济研究所共事，并在其他课题上展开合作 ） 。
In particular, Subramanian develops an index of economic dominance that should become a focus of conversation anywhere that people want to think about changes in world economic leadership.	尤其重要的是，苏布拉曼尼恩制定出了用以一个衡量经济强权的指数，而这一指数应当被那些正在思考世界经济领导权变迁的人们视为议论的焦点。
There is no need to know any economics in order to be fascinated by this book: it is about power, pure and simple.	阅读这本书并不需要任何经济基础：因为书中的内容都是关于 — — 纯粹而简单的 — — 权力。
The basic facts are incontrovertible.	有些基本事实是毋庸置疑的。
The United Kingdom was the world’s dominant economic power from the rise of industrialization in the early nineteenth century. But it lost its predominance and was gradually eclipsed by the US, which, at least since 1945, has been the undisputed leader among market-based economies.	自19世纪早期工业化兴起后英国一度占据世界经济霸主地位，但它却逐渐失去其统治力并被美国取代，而后者至少从1945年以来一直是市场经济国家中当之无愧的领袖。
The US surpassed the UK in terms of industrial production as early as the end of the nineteenth century, but that was not enough to tip the balance.	美国的工业生产其实在19世纪末期已经超过了英国，但这并不足以影响后者的地位。
Economic predominance shifted only when the UK ran large current-account deficits during World Wars I and II – the country had to borrow heavily in order to finance its war effort, and imports were significantly higher than exports.	经济霸权只有在英国在一战和二战中积累了大量经常账户赤字 — — 因为必须大规模借贷来维持战争支出，而且进口远大于出口 — — 之后才最终易手。
Much of the world’s gold reserves ended up in the hands of the US.	全球大部分黄金储备最后也都集中到了美国人手里。
This helped undermine the role of the British pound internationally and catapulted the US dollar to the fore – particularly after the Bretton Woods conference in 1944, at which it was agreed that countries would hold their reserves in dollars as well as gold.	这使得英镑的国际地位大受影响，而美元则粉墨登场 — — 尤其是1944年建立布雷顿森林体系，各方协定可以将美元和黄金一样用作储备之后。
More recently, however, it has been the Americans’ turn consistently to run large current-account deficits, buying more from the rest of the world than they earn by selling goods and services abroad.	但最近的情况反而是美国越来越依赖于大规模经常账户赤字，出口的收入也低于比进口的支出。
On this dimension, the US seems destined to repeat the mistake of the British.	在这一点上，美国似乎注定要步英国后尘。
At the same time, emerging-market countries’ per capita income has risen – as has their international role.	与此同时，新兴市场国家的人均收入则不断攀升 — — 同时提升的还有其国际地位。
In particular, China has followed a strategy in the past decade or so that entails running large current-account surpluses and building up foreign-exchange reserves, which are now reported to be in excess of $3 trillion.	尤其是中国在过去十多年中奉行了一个创造大量经常账户顺差并积累外汇储备的战略，使其当前的外汇储备总额达到3万亿美元之巨。
Indeed, Subramanian’s most provocative argument is that China has already surpassed the US in terms of economic dominance – but we have not yet woken up to this new reality.	事实上，苏布拉曼尼恩最具争议性的观点就是中国在经济霸权方面其实已经超过了美国 — — 只是我们还未能意识到这个新现实而已。
The story is fascinating and well told; but there is still a great deal worth arguing.	针对过去那段精彩历史已经有大量论述；但依然有很多问题值得深究。
For example, did the British decline because the US could not be stopped, or because of problems within the British Empire and at home?	比如说，英国的衰落是否是因为美国的不可遏制，而是源自于整个大英帝国或者英国本土的内部问题？
A few years ago, some regarded Japan as having overtaken the US. Europe also was supposedly vying for global economic dominance.	许多年前也有人认为日本已经取代了美国，当时的欧洲似乎也在争夺全球经济霸权。
Now any such claims would seem preposterous.	如今看来这一切都近乎荒缪。
In both cases, the credit system got out of control, with too much lending to the private sector in 1980’s Japan and excessive government borrowing during the 2000’s in the eurozone.	上述两个地区的信贷系统其实都已失控，1980年代的日本向私人部门发放了过多贷款，而2000年后的欧元区国家政府又欠下了巨额政府债务。
Similarly, it remains unclear that the Chinese development path will remain smooth.	同样，中国的发展能否一直保持平稳也有待观察。
Fixed investment in China is close to 50% of GDP – which must be a world record.	该国固定资产投资额已经接近GDP的50 % — —这堪称一项世界记录。
Credit to state firms and to households continues to grow rapidly.	对国有企业和家庭的信贷则持续快速增长。
Isn’t this a version of exactly what derailed Japanese growth?	这不正跟当年日本的失控增长类似吗？
On the key issue of being able to issue a “reserve currency” that investors and governments want to hold, Subramanian is correct that China has many of the prerequisites in place.	在发行一个投资者和政府都愿意持有的“储备货币”问题上，苏布拉曼尼恩认为中国已经具备了许多先决条件，这是事实。
But it still lacks some key elements, including fully-fledged property rights.	但中国依然缺乏某些关键因素。 包括完全意义上的所有权。
If you worry about getting your money out of a country when times turn tough, China is not an attractive place to hold your reserves.	如果你担心当经济环境转差时无法转移资金的话，中国就不是一个适合存放储备的地方。
External challenges do sometimes bring down states.	外部挑战有时也会拖垮整个国家。
But, more frequently, the big problems are internal – the regime cannot deliver growth, its legitimacy fades, and people start to head for the exits (or at least get their money out).	但更频繁出现的情况时是国家内部出现了大的变故 — — 政权无法实现经济增长，失去其合法性，人民开始设法转移到其他国家（或至少将资金转移出国 ） 。
If the US is eclipsed any time soon, this will more likely be due to its loss of social cohesion and its dysfunctional politics.	因此如果美国将在近期任何时候被超越的话，这更可能是因为其社会凝聚力的丢失以及无效运作的政治系统。
China might well step in to fill that vacuum, but that is quite different from being able to elbow America aside.	中国很有可能会填补这一真空，但我们并不能说是它压倒了美国。
	
Who Will Help the Poor?	谁来保护弱者？
PARIS – With the deepening of the economic crisis and the prospect of another recession looming large on the horizon, growing social inequality has become an increasingly urgent issue.	巴黎 — — 经济危机进一步加深，衰退前景再度出现，这一切也加剧了社会不平等，使其成为日益严峻的一个问题。
How does one reinforce a sense of solidarity and responsibility within a country?	如何才能在一个国家内部加强归属感和责任感？
Who will protect the weakest?	谁来保护弱势者的权益？
As I ponder this issue, I am reminded of a debate that I had more than ten years ago in Berlin with the German theologian Hans Küng and American and Asian participants.	在思考这个问题之际，我回想起十多年前在柏林同德国神学家孔汉斯（Hans Küng）的一场辩论，当时参加讨论的还有来自美国和亚洲的人士。
The subject was “Globalization and Ethics” – specifically, a comparison of the ways that Europe, the United States and Asia protect the most fragile members of their respective societies.	讨论的主题是“全球化与伦理学 ” — —具体而言，是对欧洲、美国和亚洲保护弱势社会成员的方式做一个比较。
All of the participants agreed that in Europe the state traditionally filled the role played by private philantropy in the US and by the family in Asia.	我们一致认为，传统上，扮演这个保护者角色的，在欧洲是国家，在美国是私营慈善事业，在亚洲则是家庭。
But we all hastened to add that no model was “pure,” i.e., the family was no longer what it used to be in Asia, the state was playing a bigger role than expected in America, and it was often underperforming in Europe.	但我们都连忙补充说，没有哪种模式是“纯粹的 ” ， 比方说，亚洲的家庭早已不是原先那样，国家在美国所起的作用超出人们的预想，而在欧洲则往往表现得不尽人意。
Reality has become even more complicated since then: the family’s role continues to decline in Asia; philantropy, despite a few extraordinarily generous individuals, has more than met its limits in America; and, with the possible exception of the Nordic countries, the state in Europe, overburdened by debt, no longer has the means or the will to shoulder new responsibilities.	这十几年来，现实已经变得愈加复杂：亚洲家庭的角色进一步衰微；美国的慈善事业遭遇瓶颈，除了几个慈善家特别慷慨以外，整体上不进反退；而欧洲的国家被债务压得喘不过气来，已没有能力和意愿去肩负新的责任 — — 北欧国家可能算是例外。
So who will take on the responsibility to protect the weakest if none of these three actors can do it properly?	如果上述三个能动因素统统失灵，还能指望谁去保护弱者？
Are we heading toward a world united by shared incompetence and inadequacy?	这个世界是不是正在走向集体无能的境地？
In the Western world, the poorest are the worst affected by economic stagnation.	在西方，穷人是经济停滞最大的受害者。
But, in rapidly growing emerging-market countries, the rich tend to close their eyes to the suffering of the poorest, except when they feel threatened by the risk of political upheaval, as in, say, Saudi Arabia.	即使在经济快速增长的新兴市场国家，新富们也对穷人的苦难视而不见，只有政治动乱迫近的威胁才能令他们有所醒悟，就像在沙特那样。
In fact, wealthy elites in emerging countries live in a state of denial towards their poor, literally ignoring them.	事实上，新兴国家的富裕精英阶层，其生活方式就是在排斥穷人，就是在漠视穷人。
Brazil and India are particularly striking in this regard.	这情况在巴西和印度尤其令人触目惊心。
Economic growth is necessary, but not sufficient: a strong sense of social responsibility is needed as well.	经济增长是必要的，但光有增长是不够的：对社会责任的强烈意识也不可或缺。
It would be absurd to condemn, as some do, globalization as the main and only culprit in the erosion of traditional sources of support for the poor.	光去谴责全球化，说它是侵蚀传统弱者保护网的主要嫌疑犯，甚至是唯一的嫌疑犯，无疑是荒谬的。
Globalization is above all a context, an environment, even if the consequences of the first major financial and economic crisis of the global age will further deepen the gap between the very rich and the very poor.	全球化最多只是一个背景、一种环境，尽管全球时代的第一场金融经济大危机的确把富豪和赤贫之间的差距进一步拉大了。
But globalization makes the weakest among us more visible, and therefore makes the absence of social justice more unacceptable.	但全球化也凸显了弱者的处境，从而令社会公正的缺位显得尤其不可容忍。
A world of much greater transparency and interdependency creates new responsibilities for the rich.	在一个具有更高透明度和更大相依性的世界里，富人面临着新的责任。
Or, more precisely, it makes the old responsibility to protect the weakest both more difficult and more urgent.	说得更准确一点，它令保护弱势者的旧有责任变得更加困难和更加紧迫。
In a world of increasing complexity, perhaps what is needed are simple solutions.	在一个变得日益复杂的世界里，也许恰恰需要简单的办法。
One could follow, for example, Adam Smith’s principle of comparative advantage: what Europe does best is the state, while Asia still relies on the family and the US continues to focus on individual initiative.	例如，人们可以遵循亚当·斯密的比较优势原理：欧洲的强项是国家，亚洲仍然依赖家庭，美国继续坚持个人善举。
The problem is that in a world of universal benchmarking, the legitimacy of solutions will stem more than ever from their cultural acceptability and their efficiency.	问题是在一个普世对标的世界里，各种办法的合法性以前所未有的程度依赖于文化兼容性和效果的优劣性。
In Western Europe, for example, the call for sacrifice from all citizens in order to resolve the debt crisis runs up against a lingering perception that not all will contribute equally, and that social inequality will be exacerbated by austerity.	例如，在西欧，呼吁全体公民为解决债务危机做牺牲，在一种根深蒂固的感受面前变得苍白无力：每个人的牺牲并不平等，削减福利会加剧社会不公。
Restoring growth in the short term while addressing debt problems in the medium and long term may well be the only valid response to the crisis.	但是，短期内重振经济增长，中长期内解决债务问题，毕竟是应对危机的唯一恰当方式。
But it will not work, in Europe or elsewhere, without a much greater emphasis on social justice.	然而，不论是在欧洲或是其他地方，假如不加大力度强调社会公平，这些应对方式就无法奏效。
While some of the very rich complain, as Warren Buffett did recently, that they do not pay enough taxes, the enlightened generosity of these happy few – who want to save capitalism and liberalism – is unlikely to be emulated by the new rich in the emerging countries, much less by the rich elsewhere.	不过，像沃伦·巴菲特等富豪直言自己纳税太少的开明、慷慨之举 — — 当然，他们是为了拯救资本主义和自由主义 — — 不太可能得到新兴市场国家新富们的群起效仿，更不容易在其他国家的富人群体中一呼百应。
Let’s be realistic: people like Buffett and Bill Gates have very few followers even among the very rich in the US.	我们得现实一点看问题：像巴菲特和比尔·盖茨那样的慈善富豪，即便是在美国这样的富裕国家，也响应者聊聊。
And can Asian societies really revive an effective sense of family responsibility?	此外，亚洲社会真的能够复兴家庭的责任感吗？
Globalization does appear to have weakened cultural differences noticeably in the past decade.	过去十年，全球化的确显著地敉平了文化差异。
But, when it comes to the protection of the weakest and the struggle against rising social injustice, perhaps “global deculturation” creates an opportunity to combine the best of what remains in particular traditions.	但是，在保护弱势者、抵抗社会不公加剧势头方面，这种“文化差异的全球化消除”也许恰恰创造了一个机会，令我们可以把各个传统中的精华部分结合起来。
Perhaps countries should seek to base their social-welfare systems on a new synthesis of the state, the family, and philanthropy.	也许，各国都应尝试在综合国家、家庭和慈善的基础上重建社会福利体系。
	
Who Will Rescue the Rest of Us?	谁又来拯救我们？
SYDNEY – The rescue of the 33 Chilean miners, from what was feared would be their tomb, gave the world something to cheer about.	发自悉尼 — — 33名智利矿工的成功脱险无疑值得全世界为之欢欣鼓舞。
Hope has not, after all, become a redundant virtue in the twenty-first century.	这毕竟说明希望这玩意儿还是存在于21世纪的。
But, looking around us today, there do not seem to be many reasons for optimism elsewhere.	但除此之外，我们身边已经没有多少能带来希望的事物了。
The world lurches towards a currency war, or even towards trade protectionism, threatening to destroy jobs and growth.	当今世界，货币战争一触即发，贸易保护主义再度抬头，两者都是拉低就业破坏增长的危险因子。
America’s recovery from recession is anemic and largely jobless.	美国衰退后的复苏进程十分疲软，并伴随着大量的失业。
China, meanwhile, with foreign reserves worth half its total output, denies with a straight face that it is deliberately manipulating the value of the renminbi. So its trade surplus continues to soar at the expense of other countries.	而中国这个外汇储备相当于其出口总额的一半的国家则不敢直面自己一直刻意操纵人民币汇率的现实，并继续把自己的贸易顺差建立在他国的痛苦之上。
Nor does a global solution to the challenge of climate change appear any closer.	此外，应对气候变迁的全球共识方案仍遥遥无期。
A few weeks of rain in Australia has emboldened those who think that global warming is a gigantic hoax perpetrated by the United Nations or conspiring scientists or maybe men from Mars.	澳大利亚连续数周的降雨更让人们怀疑，所谓的全球变暖，只不过是联合国或那些心怀不轨的科学家，甚至是火星人杜撰出来的大骗局罢了。
The war in Afghanistan bleeds more lives and treasure into the inhospitable terrain of that sad land, with little immediate chance of whatever might constitute sufficient success to allow America and its allies to quit. And the problems of Pakistan fester next door.	在阿富汗战场，大量的生命和财富湮灭在滚滚黄沙之中，却无法为美国及其盟友换来哪怕一丁点的胜利，好让他们能给自己找一个体面脱身的理由，而邻国巴基斯坦的问题也在日渐恶化。
In Palestine, Israeli colonies continue to grow with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ignoring Washington’s efforts to secure traction for the peace process.	在巴勒斯坦，以色列总理内塔尼亚胡置华盛顿当局推动中东平和进程的决心于不顾，犹太人定居点不断在巴勒斯坦的土地上蚕食蔓延。
Europeans continue to look inward, obsessed with their own problems of declining competitiveness and how to pay for entitlements that they have come to regard as theirs by right.	而欧盟也自顾不暇，因为它们既头痛于如何处理竞争力下降的问题，又为如何支付那些人们自以为应得的福利而苦恼。
With the gap between the world’s rich and poor increasing, the impoverished South seeks a home or a job in the developed North.	随着世界贫富差距逐渐扩大，贫穷的南半球人民开始去富裕的北半球寻找家园和工作。
Legal and illegal migration triggers far-right hostility in countries that customarily brag about their commitment to civil liberties.	但在那些平时吹嘘自己奉行公民自由的国家里，无论是合法还是非法的移民都激起了极右势力的敌意。
So, as Lenin once asked, what is to be done?	事到如今，正如列宁曾经问过的 ： “ 该怎么办呢 ？ ”
The world obviously needs political leadership of the highest quality to see us through.	很明显，我们需要最优秀的政治领袖来带领众人度过难关。
We need the sort of courage that was the hallmark of Margaret Thatcher. We need Bill Clinton’s extraordinary ability to spin a political narrative that enabled voters to identify their own interests with his goals.	我们需要撒切尔夫人那样的勇气，需要比尔·克林顿那种能引导选民把自身利益与政治家目标融为一体的超凡政治游说力。
We require Helmut Kohl’s understanding of the need to identify the big decisions in politics, and to get those decisions right.	我们要德国前总理科尔这样的人物，不但能认识到锁定关键政治决策的紧迫性，还能将这些决策很好地落实下来。
We need leaders with sufficient mastery of detail, like China’s last premier Zhu Rongji, who can not only tell us how they will get us from A to Z, but can actually lead us from A to B.	我们还需要如中国前总理朱镕基这样对全局了如指掌的领袖，不但能告诉我们起点和终点在哪里，还能具体带领我们一步一步向目标迈进。
Looking around, leaders like this seem to be an extinct species.	放眼全球，这样的领袖真的是凤毛麟角。
Or, if they exist at all, they appear to be constrained by dysfunctional political systems. Their ability to act is limited by their political environment.	即便有这样的人，也被机能失调的政治制度限制着，他们的行动能力也被身处的政治环境所制约着，无法动弹。
The best example is US President Barack Obama, on whom so many hopes rested – probably too many for any one leader.	美国总统奥巴马就是一个很好的例子，在他身上承载着如此多的希望，已经超出了任何一个领袖的承受能力了。
Obama inherited messy and expensive wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and an economy in meltdown.	奥巴马接过了阿富汗和伊拉克这两个肮脏而昂贵的烂摊子，同时还得面对近乎崩溃的国内经济。
His attempts to revive the economy have inevitably driven up the deficit.	为了挽救经济，他无可避免地要扩大财政赤字。
But no recovery in the labor or housing markets has yet materialized.	但就业和住房市场的复苏却并未如期出现。
Now Obama faces defeat in the mid-term elections at the hands of Republicans whose past policies created many of the problems that weigh him down today.	如今奥巴马眼看要在中期选举中败于共和党之手，而事实上，正是共和党人此前制造的众多麻烦令奥巴马落到了这般田地。
They want less government, lower taxes, and a smaller deficit, a combination to be achieved seemingly without pain.	这些共和党人宣布要压缩政府规模，要降低税收，要减少财政赤字 — — 仿佛这一切都无须付出任何代价唾手可得一样。
This nonsense on stilts is articulated by some zany candidates who enjoy the support of the Tea Party, a reference not to the Mad Hatter in Alice in Wonderland, which would be fitting, but to the Bostonians who rebelled against colonial Britain’s imposition of taxes in the eighteenth century.	这种愚蠢的政治表演已经为成为了某些脑残候选人的拿手好戏，而背后支持他们的则是“茶党（Tea Party ） ” — — 我说的是18世纪反抗英国征收税款的那批波士顿民众，而不是电影《爱丽丝梦游仙境》里与男主角“疯帽子”共进下午茶的那帮疯子，不过这个解释似乎更适合这些政治家。
The rest of the world needs a strong, self-confident, and decisive America.	世界需要一个强大，自信且果断的美国。
But America’s political system is about to deliver a balance of power in Washington that is likely to produce stalemate and paralysis.	但美国的政治体制的核心却使华盛顿内部的权力相互制衡，并因此导致了政治僵局和瘫痪。
In Europe, meanwhile, many of our problems are exemplified by what is happening in France, where President Nicolas Sarkozy’s attempt to recognize demographic and fiscal reality by raising the retirement age from 60 to 62 provoked a wave of strikes and stormy protests from workers and students.	此外，欧洲的许多问题都因法国国内的混乱而被放大�� — — 萨科齐总统被迫承认人口和财政的压力，他试图把退休年龄从60岁延迟到62岁的计划激起了一浪接一浪的罢工，以及工人学生暴风骤雨般的游行示威。
Is there not something deeply depressing about 18-year-olds demonstrating about the retirement age?	我很难明白，在退休年龄这个问题上，究竟是什么深深挫伤了这帮18岁示威者幼小的心灵？
How on earth did they acquire such a statist and conservative mind-set?	他们又是在哪里养成了如此僵化和保守的思维呢？
Perhaps, then, Asia is the answer.	也许，问题的答案在亚洲。
Perhaps the Singapore-based strategist Kishore Mahbubani is correct to write off the West and tell us that the future lies in his own continent.	也许新加坡战略家马凯硕说得对，西方已经没落，世界的未来在亚洲。
The evidence on that point is mixed.	这个观点的论据是复杂多样的。
India is a glorious democracy with an economically literate government and pockets of real economic achievement.	印度是一个伟大的民主国家，其政府深谙经济理论，也取得了一定的经济建设成果。
But the fiasco in the run-up to the Commonwealth Games showcased some of India’s problems, not least deep corruption and inadequate infrastructure.	但英联邦运动会的一地鸡毛也折射出印度的一些问题，且不仅仅是深层次的腐败和落后的基础设施而已。
If those problems were sorted out, India’s growth rate would outstrip China’s.	如果这些问题都解决了，印度的增长率将超过中国。
And what of the booming Middle Kingdom?	至于蓬勃发展的“中央帝国”又怎么样呢？
In Brussels the other day, Premier Wen Jiabao scolded European leaders for pressing for the renminbi’s revaluation.	前几天在布鲁塞尔，温家宝总理指责欧洲各国领导人逼迫人民币升值。
Did they not understand, he argued, that this would lead to factory closures and social turbulence in China?	他说，难道这些欧洲人不知道，人民币升值将导致中国国内大量工厂倒闭和社会动荡吗？
Elsewhere, of course, this sort of turmoil has democratic safety valves.	当然，在其他地方，这种混乱自有民主的安全阀来排泄掉。
It is more than odd to argue that the rest of the world has to cope with a built-in advantage for China’s exporters because its authoritarian political system cannot cope with any change.	但让人无比讶异的是：世界其他国家之所以必须忍受中国出口商这种内生性优势，原来就是因为该国的独裁政治体制无法承受任何波动。
No wonder the impressive premier is thought to favor some political loosening.	难怪这位给人印象深刻的总理似乎也打算给国内政治松绑了。
From East to West, politics seems to be operating in a manner that is, to be diplomatic, sub-optimal.	从东方到西方，政治似乎都在以某种妥协的次优方式在运作。
Then again, maybe we’re lucky that things aren’t worse.	可能我们也该为事情没有继续恶化而暗自庆幸了。
The Chilean miners survived against the odds, so perhaps the rest of us will somehow get by as well.	智利矿工在九死一生的情况下重见天日，因此我们或许也能挺过来的。
But who, exactly, is responsible for the rescue operation?	但问题是，究竟谁才能承担起拯救我们的重任呢？
	
Who Will Run the World?	何人统领世界？
SINGAPORE – Barack Obama’s election comes at a moment when a new bit of conventional wisdom is congealing.	新加坡 - - 奥巴马当选总统正值新的传统智慧凝固之际。
It concerns the end of America’s global dominance.	这事关美国全球统领地位的终结。
True, freewheeling American-style capitalism has not acquitted itself proudly of late.	的确，美国式自由放任的资本主义最近乏善可陈。
And America’s military superiority has not proved all that useful in accomplishing American ends.	而美国军事优势在实现美国的目标上也并不奏效。
But who may pick up the slack in providing global leadership?	但是谁又会在提供全球领导地位上收拾局面呢？
The uncomfortable answer that Obama is likely to confront is this: nobody.	奥巴马有可能面对的并不令人愉乐的答案是：谁也不行。
America may be damaged, but no replacement is on offer.	美国或许受到了伤害，但是还没有出现替代国家。
Europe is self-absorbed, focused on creating whatever kind of entity it ends up deciding to be.	欧洲关注自我，只是在建立随便它打算要的实体。
China’s standard response to any suggestion that it exercise global leadership is to hide beneath its vast internal agenda and plead poverty.	中国对任何其实施全球领导地位建议的标准回复就是躲在国内问题背后并且宣称自己的贫困问题。
No other country comes close to having either the capacity or the ambition.	没有任何国家接近于拥有能力或者雄心。
In the face of the familiar litany of desperate global problems – not just financial instability, but also climate change, energy insecurity, potential pandemics, terrorism, and the spread of weapons of mass destruction – the prospect of a rudderless world is more than alarming.	人们面对熟悉的一大堆急迫的全球性问题，不仅是金融不稳定，而且还包括气候变化、能源不安全、潜在的传染病、恐怖主义以及大规模杀伤性武器的扩散。 世界群龙无首的局面极为令人担忧。
What is to be done?	应该做些什么？
And by whom?	由谁来做呢？
Given that the United States has not been playing much of a leadership role on many of these issues recently, it is worth taking a look at what happens when no one country exercises effective leadership.	鉴于美国最近在这些问题上并未发挥多大的领导作用，现在就值得观察一下在没有任何一个国家实施有效领导作用之际局面会是如何。
One set of answers might seem apparent from the collapse of international trade negotiations and the unraveling international system to control the spread of nuclear weapons.	其中一套答案从国际贸易谈判破裂以及国际体系无力制止核武器扩散来看就十分明显。
Things can certainly get grim.	事情会变得十分严峻。
But that is not the whole story.	但是这还不是问题的全部。
To see why, consider climate change.	要知道为什么，可以看一看气候变化问题。
It is now clear that avoiding catastrophic climate change requires dramatic and rapid reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions, cuts that would lower annual emissions to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050.	现在清楚的是，为了避免灾难性的气候变化就要求迅速大幅度降低温室气体排放，年度排放水平必须在2050年的时候低于1990年80%的水平。
Yet emissions are not just rising, but accelerating.	但是排放量不仅还在上升，而且在加速。
The coming recession may stem their growth temporarily, but only slightly.	即将而来的经济衰退也许能够暂时阻止其增长，但是程度轻微。
The necessary reductions imply a rapid and radical transformation of industrial, energy, and land-use systems around the world.	必要的削减要求全球工业、能源以及土地使用体系发生迅速巨大的转变。
What are governments doing about this?	各国政府如何从事这一工作呢？
Supposedly, by December 2009 they will agree on a new treaty to set limits on emissions.	它们理应在2009年12月达成新的协议来限制排放。
But the prospects that an agreement will be reached in Copenhagen in December 2009 are close to nil.	但是这一协议能够在2009年12月在哥本哈根达成的前景几乎是零。
The new Obama administration will have only a few months to develop meaningful proposals that can win domestic support, and will be preoccupied with the aftermath of the current financial debacle and the Iraq war.	奥巴马政府只有几个月的时间制定有意义的、可以赢得国内支持的建议，而且该政府将会集中经理处理当前金融危机和伊拉克战争的后果。
Europe is pushing for ambitious targets but is having trouble with its own vested interests.	欧洲正在推动雄心勃勃的目标但是在自身既得利益上存在麻烦。
The large emerging countries, although they will suffer disproportionately from wilder weather and rising sea levels, show little interest in picking up the slack.	新兴的大国尽管更多地承受气候反复无常和海平面升高之苦，但是却没有兴趣收拾残局。
Negotiation watchers term the current American-Chinese dance of mutual blame a suicide pact.	观察谈判的人士把美中之间相互指责的游戏称为自杀协议。
In short, the process is a mess.	简而言之，整个进程就是混乱不堪。
This is hardly surprising.	这并不奇怪。
An inter-governmental system that falls apart under the challenges of trade negotiations and proliferation threats is unlikely to master the deep complexity and multitudinous vested interests that the issue of climate change entails.	政府间体系在贸易谈判以及武器扩散的挑战之下瓦解，就难以掌握气候变化问题所带来的千头万绪和众多既得利益。
Traditional diplomacy will at best devise a face-saving but meaningless accord next year.	传统外交明年最多可以创造不丢面子但是没有意义的协议。
In many areas, frustration with inter-governmental intransigence and incompetence has sparked extraordinary innovation by non-governmental organizations, corporations, and ordinary people.	在许多领域，人们对政府间互不妥协以及难以胜任感到沮丧，从而激发了非政府组织、公司以及普通民众的特殊创新。
Private organizations such as the Forest Stewardship Council and the Marine Stewardship Council provide and, increasingly, implement environmental standards where inter-governmental action has failed.	例如森林管理委员会以及海运管理委员会等私有组织提供了政府间行动所没有达到的环境标准并且正在越发实施这些标准。
Private actors from foundations to pharmaceutical corporations to NGOs are actively experimenting with alternative ways to tackle transnational health challenges.	基金会、制药公司以及非政府组织等私有组织正在积极地试验替代性方式来处理跨国界的医疗挑战。
Often governments are part of these experiments – but they are not necessarily the drivers, and progress does not depend on signing treaties.	各国政府通常参与这些试验，但是它们并非一定是推动者，而且进步也并不取决于签署协议。
Indeed, there are many ways to put matters on the global agenda, as shown by Bono’s campaigns on African development and Al Gore’s on climate change.	确实，有许多办法把问题放到全球议题上。 波诺推动非洲发展以及戈尔推动气候变化问题都证明了这一点。
Agreements about how to make things better already frequently include NGOs and corporations in various capacities – and sometimes exclude governments altogether.	有关改进已经经常包括不同身份的非政府组织和公司，有时候干脆就排除政府在外。
Private groups using everything from satellite imagery (as in forestry) to the unofficial equivalent of on-site inspections (as in human rights) monitor who is abiding by – or violating – what standard of behavior.	私有组织利用一切手段，从森林卫星图像到人权问题上相当于非正式的现场视察谁在遵守或者违反行为标准。
While enforcement in the coercive sense remains the domain of states, coercive enforcement is rare even when it comes to inter-governmental agreements.	尽管使用强迫手段实施还是国家的范围，但是即使在政府间协议上强迫实施也是极为少见的。
Whether countries abide by agreements has far more to do with international processes of persuasion, socialization, and capacity-building – and those can be done by anyone with a good argument.	各国是否遵守协议更为主要地是在于国际间劝说、交际以及能力建设的进程，而这些只要有好的论点任何人都可以做到。
The big question today is whether all these alternative approaches can add up to more than a bit of desperate tinkering around the edges.	如今的大问题是，这些替代性手段是否可以要比绝望地在边缘运作要有效。
Standard international-relations thinking does not even entertain the question, and those conventional ways of seeing the world have blinded us to looking at this crucial question.	标准的国际关系思维甚至并不考虑这一问题，而传统观察世界的方法阻碍我们看到这一关键问题所在。
As a result, we do not yet know the answer.	结果，我们还不知道答案。
Data remain scarce.	数据还是稀少。
There are hundreds of global public-private partnerships working on various global ills – but few have been examined to see what good they do.	全世界有数以百计的公私伙伴组织在处理解决不同的全球性难题，但是人们很少检查它们做了那些好事。
The mishmash of initiatives, actors, campaigns, and appeals creates opportunities for major progress – and mass confusion.	各种倡议、参与者、运动以及申诉给重大进展和大范围混乱提供了机会。
If there is to be real progress toward more effective and efficient global governance that can address the unprecedented challenges posed by climate change and the rest of the global agenda, we must do much more than look for an easy replacement for American hegemony.	气候变化以及其他全球性议题带来了前所未有的挑战。 要想在处理这些挑战的更为有效和效力的全球管理上实现真正的进步，我们还必须不能停留在简单地寻求替换美国霸权上。
We must figure out how to make sense of this enormous diversity of ways of saving the world.	我们必须找到方式来理解如此众多的拯救世界的多样途经。
	
Citizen Bezos?	公民贝索斯？
NEW YORK – My very first serious job was as a fact-checker for Forbes magazine (now mostly a laissez-faire collection of blogs).	纽约 — — 我的第一份工作是在《福布斯》杂志（现已基本成为放任自流的博客大杂烩）负责事实审核。
I consider fact-checkers to be the altar boys of journalism.	我认为事实审核员是新闻业的忠实侍者。
And, despite having left the church, I still feel a profound reverence for the holy truth.	尽管已离开教堂，我仍然敬畏神圣的真理。
So, in most of the discussion about business models occasioned by the sale of the Washington Post to Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, the values that I have held dear are being tarnished.	因此，在亚马逊创始人兼首席执行官杰夫·贝索斯收购《华盛顿邮报》引发的商业模式大讨论中，我所珍视的价值观遭到了践踏。
How so?	为什么这么说？
Even reputable fact-checkers disagree on the origin of the famous admonition to journalists: “Comfort the afflicted, and afflict the comfortable!”	就连享有盛誉的事实审核员也无法就“给苦难者以慰藉、给舒适者以折磨 ！ ” 这条知名记者箴言的起源达成一致。
(They even disagree on whether it was first directed at preachers or at newsmen).	（他们甚至无法确定这句话最早是用来形容牧师还是新闻记者 ） 。
In any case, journalism is one business in which the customer is not always right.	但无论如何，新闻行业的客户并不总是正确的。
The challenge that business considerations pose to journalism – both news and commentary providers – takes the form of three separate temptations: to slant the news to please readers rather than inform them, and thus attract advertisers; to slant the news to please advertisers directly; and to slant the news to advance owners’ political or commercial interests.	商业因素给包括新闻及评论机构在内的新闻业以诱惑的形式带来三重挑战：歪曲新闻以取悦而不是客观地告知读者，并以此来吸引广告客户；歪曲新闻直接吸引广告客户；歪曲新闻为所有者的政治或商业利益服务。
These temptations have always been present, but “hard” news could be supported by constituency-pleasing sections, advertiser-pleasing features and product reviews, news-you-can-use sections replete with ads for related goods, and, of course, the classified ads.	上述诱惑始终存在，但“重大”新闻背后其实还可以掺杂取悦顾客的报导、取悦广告商的特写和产品评述，以及充斥着相关产品、当然还有分类广告的实用新闻栏目。
Today, the church of newspaper journalism is fragmenting.	今天新闻的神圣殿堂正在土崩瓦解。
Brands and advertisers can speak directly to customers, and markets no longer need the convening power of a newspaper to match buyers and sellers (the purpose of classified ads).	品牌和广告商可以直接与客户沟通，市场也不再需要媒体扮演将买卖双方匹配在一起（也是分类广告的目的）的角色。
Investigative journalism and serious commentary, like religion, do not have a profit model.	像宗教一样，新闻调查和严肃评论本身并不具备盈利的模式。
They serve a higher purpose (although they can be and often are corrupted or twisted for bad ends).	它们为更高的目标服务（虽然往往遭到扭曲或破坏，为不可告人的目标提供服务 ） 。
So, should we welcome Bezos’s entry into this world?	那么，我们是否应当欢迎贝索斯进入新闻行业？
Many commentators expect him to digitize-monetize-revolutionize the Post (whatever that means).	许多评论家预测他将实现《华盛顿邮报》的数字化、货币化及改革化（无论这几个词究竟是什么意思 ） 。
But I think he bought it for a different purpose.	但我认为其收购背后另有目标。
He is a canny businessman – that much is clear.	他是一位精明的商人 — — 这一点是毋庸置疑的。
He runs Amazon tightly and for the long term; it generates huge amounts of cash, which it reinvests on behalf of all of its shareholders.	他长期在亚马逊开展严密的经营活动；后者为他带来巨额现金，他又代表全体股东进行再投资操作。
But it is Bezos personally, not Amazon, who bought the Post.	但收购《邮报》的是贝索斯个人，而不是亚马逊这家企业。
This is a man who is a generous donor to the Long Now Foundation (I am on its board) and who personally founded and owns a rocket company, Blue Origin (I am on the board of a competing company called XCOR).	贝索斯是今日永存基金会（我也是该基金会的董事成员）慷慨的捐助者，其个人还创办并且拥有一家叫蓝源（Blue Origin）的火箭公司（而我则是其竞争对手XCOR公司的董事 ） 。
I think – I hope! – that Bezos will make the proper distinctions.	我认为 — — 我希望！ 贝索斯能够进行适当的区隔。
He understands the difference between media (yet another of his personal investments is the Web site Business Insider) and journalism.	他理解媒体和新闻之间的区别（但商业内幕网站是他的另外一项个人投资 ） 。
In our market-driven times, we tend to think about the price of everything and the value of nothing, as Oscar Wilde put it.	恰如奥斯卡·王尔德所说，在以市场为导向的年代，价格而非价值是我们考虑的目标。
But we are also discovering behavioral economics – the human quirks and emotional urges that drive people to do things that make little economic sense.	但我们也见证了行为经济学 — — 人类的怪癖和情绪冲动促使人们做出没有经济意义的决策。
The best joke of all – that Bezos bought the Post by mistake through an errant one-click purchase (a capability patented by Amazon) – has a ring of truth to it.	其中最离谱的笑话 — — 贝索斯因为点错鼠标而错误地一键买入（这是亚马逊一项曾获专利的技术 ） 《 华盛顿邮报》多少有一点现实的味道。
The purchase was not an economically motivated decision, though it was no mistake.	虽然算不上是一次错误，但也不是一次有意义的经济收购。
There probably is not a sustainable business model for newspapers like the Post.	《邮报》这样的报纸或许没有可持续的经营模式。
But I do think there is sustainable value of the kind that no corporation or financially driven investor could ever justify.	但我的确认为企业或金融投资者永远无法理解的长期价值是切实存在的。
Bezos’s move is not like the recent purchases of Newsweek, where there was an illusion of turning it around, or the Boston Globe, bought by John Henry, who owns the Boston Red Sox baseball team and Liverpool Football Club.	贝索斯此举不同于此前抱着扭亏为盈的幻想对于《新闻周刊》的收购。 它也不同于约翰·亨利收购《波士顿环球报 》 ， 后者已经将波士顿红袜队和利物浦足球俱乐部的所有权收入囊中。
Perhaps the most interesting example is Rupert Murdoch – the son of an Australian news baron – who recently split his family-controlled News Corporation, into the TV and film company 21st Century Fox and the less profitable new News Corp, which retains the news and publishing operations.	最耐人寻味的例子也许是澳大利亚新闻巨头的儿子鲁珀特·默多克，默多克不久前将其家族控制的新闻集团一分为二，形成了21世纪福克斯电视电影公司和保留新闻出版业务的利润不那么丰厚的新闻集团两块业务。
Although Murdoch remains chairman of both, everyone expects him to focus more on the news business.	尽管默多克身兼这两个集团的董事长，但所有人都预料他会更专注于新闻业务。
That portfolio includes both customer-pleasing tabloids with a troubled history of pandering, spying, and bribing, and the venerable journalism of the Wall Street Journal’s news pages – a contradiction that splitting the parent has not resolved.	上述业务包括曾以刺探收买等低俗手段迎合读者的小报和受人尊敬的《华尔街日报》新闻版 — — 分拆母公司并没有解决这其中的冲突。
And, finally, there is Project Syndicate itself (which publishes this column).	最后还要谈到发布这篇专栏文章的Project Syndicate本身。
Originally funded by yet another billionaire, George Soros, Project Syndicate operates independently to provide hard-to-monetize informed opinion and analysis with nary an “advertorial” or product review in sight.	Project Syndicate集团最初由另外一名亿万富翁乔治·索罗斯赞助，现在独立运营发表鲜有经济效益的观点和分析文章（在可以预见的未来既没���软广告也没有产品评述 ） 。
One way to think about the best business model for journalism is to think about the best business model for food.	思考新闻业最佳商业模式可以借鉴食品业的经验。
Is it an all-you-can-eat buffet?	究竟你想经营随意取用的自助餐？
A tony à la carte sanctuary with great wines that generate most of the profit?	以高档红酒为卖点的时尚豪华的点餐服务？
A franchise with pre-cooked dishes thawed and heated in huge ovens?	还是用大型烤箱加热事先煮熟并解冻的各色菜肴？
All can work – but only with good management.	任何一种形式都可以赚钱，问题是管理必须跟得上。
But there is also the philanthropic soup kitchen – in the Post’s case, a high-end one, delivering nutritious food in a world in which restaurants now give away less-healthy food, because they use it to sell other goods.	但还有一种情况是爱心厨房 — — 具体到《华盛顿邮报 》 ， 这家高端爱心厨房在餐馆普遍提供垃圾食品（因为他们把其他产品与垃圾食品捆绑销售）的今天为人们提供营养丰富的菜肴。
In the end, I think Bezos wants less to own the Post than to set it free, for at least a generation or two.	最后，我认为贝索斯与其想拥有《华盛顿邮报》还不如说想在至少一两代人的时间里给它以自由。
As Bezos wrote in a memo to the staff: “The values of the Post do not need changing.	正如贝索斯在给员工的一份备忘录中所写的那样 ： “ 《华盛顿邮报》的价值观不需要变化。
The paper’s duty will remain to its readers and not to the private interests of its owners.	这份报纸不会忠实于其所有者的私利，而将继续忠实于它的读者。
We will continue to follow the truth wherever it leads....”	我们将继续追寻真理到天涯海角 … ” 。
If I am wrong, I hope this commentary will help to afflict him into righteousness!	如果我说错了，希望这篇评论能让他认识到真理的价值 ！ ”
	
Why America Must Not Re-elect President Bush	为什么美国不该再选乔治·布什当总统
I have never been heavily involved in partisan politics, but these are not normal times.	我从来没热衷参与过党派政治，但现在已经是非正常时期了。
President George W. Bush is endangering the United States and the world's safety while undermining American values.	乔治·W·布什总统正在把美国和世界的安全拖入险境，同时也损害了美国信奉的价值观。
For opposing him, I have been demonized by the Bush campaign.	迫于布什班子的种种丑行，我不得不站出来反对他。
President Bush ran in 2000 on a platform promising a "humble" foreign policy.	2000年布什竞选时曾承诺实行"温和"的外交政策。
If re-elected, the Bush doctrine of preemptive action - and the invasion of Iraq - will be endorsed, and the world will have to live with the consequences.	如果再次当选，布什的霸权信条－和侵略伊拉克的行径－将会得到承认，而全世界都不得不为此付出惨重代价。
By repudiating Bush's policies at the polls, America will have a chance to regain the respect and support of the world.	通过在全民投票中批判布什的政策，美国将有机会重新赢得世界的尊敬与支持。
The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, required a strong response.	2001年9月11日的恐怖袭击迫使我们做出强烈的反应。
But they also led to suspension of the critical process so essential to a democracy - a full and fair discussion of the issues.	但这也导致了关键民主程序的缺失－没有人就此进行过全面、公正的探讨。
Bush silenced criticism by calling it unpatriotic.	所有批评意见都被布什贴上了不爱国的标签并加以压制。
For 18 months after 9/11, he managed to suppress all dissent. That is how he led America in the wrong direction.	9/11以后长达18个月，他成功地压制了所有的不同意见，他就是这样把美国引入了歧途。
In fact, Bush played right into the hands of Osama bin Laden.	实际上，布什此举正中奥萨马·本·拉登的下怀。
Afghanistan's invasion was justified: that was where bin Laden lived and al Qaeda had its training camps. Invading Iraq was not.	美国有理由入侵阿富汗：因为那里是本·拉登的驻地，也是基地组织的训练营，但入侵伊拉克却站不住脚。
It was Bush's unintended gift to bin Laden.	这是布什送给本·拉登的一份意外礼物。
Immediately after 9/11, there was a spontaneous outpouring of sympathy for America worldwide. It has given way to widespread resentment.	9/11事件刚结束时，全世界都弥漫着对美国自发的同情，现在却统统变成了憎恨。
There are many more people willing to risk their lives to kill Americans than there were on September 11.	与9月11日前相比，有更多的人愿意冒着生命的危险去刺杀美国人。
Bush likes to insist that terrorists hate Americans for what they are - a freedom loving people - not what they do.	布什总喜欢强调恐怖份子仇恨美国是因为我们之为美国－因为我们拥有热爱自由的人民，他却从未提及这种仇恨是来自我们的所作所为。
But war and occupation create innocent victims.	可是战争和占领会让无辜群众成为牺牲品。
We count the body bags of American soldiers - over 1,000 in Iraq.	让我们数一数美国士兵在伊拉克的尸骨－超过1000人已经在伊拉克丧失了生命。
The wider world also counts the Iraqis who get killed daily, perhaps 20 times more.	别的国家还在计算每天死了多少伊拉克人，这个数字几乎是美国伤亡的20倍。
Nor was the torture of detainees at Abu Ghraib prison the work of a few bad apples. It was part of a system of dealing with prisoners put in place by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.	阿布格莱布监狱的虐囚行为也绝非少数害群之马的个别行为，而是国防部长唐纳德·拉姆斯菲尔德对待犯人政策的组成部分。
Public opinion condemns America worldwide, and our troops in Iraq are paying the price.	所有的世界舆论都在谴责美国，而我们驻伊拉克的军队在为此付出代价。
Bush convinced people that he is good for American security by playing on the fears generated by the 9/11 attacks.	布什利用9/11恐怖袭击后的恐惧，成功地说服了人们他是美国安全的守护神。
At a time of peril, people rally around the flag, and Bush exploited this by fostering a sense of danger.	在危机时刻，人们集结在共同的旗帜下，而布什通过让他们相信身处险境而充分利用了这种大敌当前的团结。
His campaign assumes that people do not really care about the truth and will believe almost anything if it is repeated often enough.	这种策略的前提是人们毫不看重事实，而会相信反复灌输给他们的一切思想。
There must be something wrong with Americans if we fall for it.	如果我们真的落入了这个陷阱，那么美国人一定有什么地方出了问题。
For instance, some 40% of Americans still believe that Saddam Hussein was connected with 9/11, although the 9/11 Commission - set up by Bush and chaired by a Republican - definitively established that no such connection existed.	举个例子，40%左右的美国人到现在仍然相信，萨达姆·侯赛因与9/11事件脱不了干系，尽管由布什组建、并由民主党人任主席的9/11委员会已经做出了结论：这种所谓的联系纯属子虚乌有。
I want to shout: "Wake up America.	我想大声疾呼 ： " 美国人醒醒吧。
Don't you realize we are being misled?"	难道你们还没发现，我们正在被人所误导 ？ "
The war in Iraq was misconceived from start to finish - if it has a finish.	伊拉克战争从头到尾都是个骗局－如果它还能有个"结尾 " 。
It is a war of choice, not necessity.	这是我们主动挑起的战争，而不是被迫的还击。
Moreover, America went to war on false pretenses.	不仅如此，美国人发动战争的借口并不存在。
Weapons of mass destruction could not be found, and the connection with al Qaeda could not be established.	大规模杀伤性武器根本没有找到，和基地组织的联系也根本得不到证实。
Bush then claimed that America went to war to liberate Iraq.	于是布什又声称美国发动战争是为了解放伊拉克。
But democracy cannot be imposed by force.	但真正的民主绝不可能来自武力。
Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, and Iraqis - and the world - can rejoice in being rid of him.	萨达姆·侯赛因是独裁者，伊拉克和整个世界都会为他的倒台欢呼雀跃。
But America had an obligation to maintain law and order; instead, we stood idly by while Baghdad and other cities were ransacked.	美国有义务维护法律和秩序，但恰恰相反，当巴格达和其它城��被洗劫一空时，我们却始终坐视不管。
If we had cared about the Iraqi people, we should have had more troops available for the occupation.	如果我们真的在意伊拉克人民，就应该派更多的军队维持秩序。
We should have provided protection not only for the oil ministry, but also other ministries, museums, and hospitals.	我们应该保护的不仅是石油部，还有其它政府部门、博物馆和医院。
Worse still, when American soldiers encountered resistance, they employed methods - invading homes and mistreating prisoners - that alienated and humiliated the population, generating resentment and rage.	更糟糕的是，美国士兵遇到抵抗时，他们选择了侵入民宅和虐待俘虏－这种做法使伊拉克人蒙受了耻辱，使他们最终丧失了信心，并激发了他们的愤怒与怨恨。
The Bush administration's flip-flops and missteps are legion.	我们看到了太多的朝令夕改和决策失误。
First the Iraqi army was dissolved, then America tried to reconstitute it.	开始时伊拉克军队遭到解散，接着美国又试图重建。
First the US tried to eliminate the Baathists, then America turned to them for help.	起初美国想消灭叙利亚社会党，后来又转而寻求他们的帮助。
When the insurgency became intractable, America installed an Iraqi government. The man chosen to lead it was a protégé of the CIA with a reputation for being a strongman - a far cry from democracy.	当动荡局面演变得无法控制，美国又扶植了伊拉克政府，并把中央情报局的保护对象扶上了头把交椅，此人一贯有着铁腕的名声，这与民主要求可谓相去甚远。
Despite the Bush campaign's efforts at spin control, the situation in Iraq is dire.	尽管布什阵营绞尽脑汁想扭转颓势，但伊拉克局势仍旧危机重重。
Much of the western part of the country has been ceded to insurgents, the prospect of holding free and fair elections in January is fast receding, civil war looms.	那里西部的大片领土都落入了叛乱分子的控制，而1月举行自由公正选举的可能性几乎为零，内战更是一触即发。
Bush's war in Iraq has done untold damage to America as well, impairing its military power and undermining the morale of the armed forces.	布什的对伊战争也给美国造成了不可估量的损害，不仅削弱了我们的军力，也给部队的士气带来了沉重的打击。
Before the war, America could project overwhelming force. Not anymore.	对伊战争前，美国曾拥有压倒优势的军力，现在这已经不复存在。
Afghanistan is slipping from control.	阿富汗局势正在失控。
North Korea, Iran, Pakistan, and other countries pursue nuclear programs with renewed vigor.	北朝鲜、伊朗、巴基斯坦和其它国家又鼓起勇气投入了核武器的研究。
The Bush administration can be criticized for many other policies, but none are as important as Iraq.	布什政府还有很多其它政策值得商榷，但没有一个像伊拉克这么严重。
The war has cost nearly $200 billion, and costs will continue to mount, because getting into Iraq was much easier than getting out will be.	战争耗费了近2000亿美元，这个数字还会继续上升，因为进入远比撤出更加容易。
Bush has been taunting John Kerry to explain how he would do things differently.	布什一直嘲笑约翰·凯利，让他说说能带来哪些变化。
Kerry has responded that he would have done everything differently, and that he would be in a better position to extricate us.	凯利的回答是，他的所有做法都会变化，他能够更好地解脱美国。
But it won't be easy for him, either, because America is caught in a quagmire.	但这对他来讲也并不容易，因为美国已经陷入了一个巨大的泥潭。
Top military and diplomatic experts desperately warned Bush not to invade Iraq. He ignored them.	军政两界的顶级专家拼命地告诫布什别侵入伊拉克，可他对这种警告充耳不闻。
He suppressed the critical process, arguing that any criticism of the Commander-in-Chief puts US troops at risk.	他压制批评意见，说任何对总司令的批评都会给美国军队带来危险。
But this is Bush's war, and he ought to be held responsible for it.	可这是布什的战争，他应该为此负责。
Americans should step back for a moment and ask: who got them into this mess?	美国人应该退一步思考并扪心自问：是谁把他们带到了目前的境地？
A moment's reflection should raise another question: does Bush's Texas swagger qualify him to remain America's Commander-in-Chief?	片刻的思考会引发另外一个疑问：布什的德克萨斯牛皮能不能使他继续留任美国的三军统帅？
	
Calling Off America’s Bombs	阻止美国的炸弹
NEW YORK – As the US Congress considers whether to authorize American military intervention in Syria, its members should bear in mind a basic truth: While Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad has repeatedly used extreme violence to retain power, the United States – and other governments in the Middle East and Europe – share responsibility for turning Syria into a killing field.	纽约—在美国国会在考虑是否授权军事干预叙利亚，各位议员应该记住一个基本事实：叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德为了把持权力而一再使用极端暴力，但美国 — — 以及其他中东和欧洲政府 — — 也要为叙利亚变成屠杀场承担一定责任。
These governments, led by the US, have explicitly sought the violent overthrow of Assad.	这些政府在美国的领导下赤裸裸地寻求以暴力推翻巴沙尔。
Without their involvement, Assad’s regime would most likely have remained repressive; with their involvement, Syria has become a site of mass death and destruction.	没有它们的介入，巴沙尔政权极有可能仍然会采取高压政策；有了它们的参与，叙利亚变成了大规模死亡和毁灭之地。
More than 100,000 people have died, and many of the world’s cultural and archaeological treasures have been demolished.	超过10万人已经丧生，大量世界文化和考古财富被摧毁。
Syria’s civil war has occurred in two phases.	叙利亚内战包括两个阶段。
The first phase, roughly from January 2011 until March 2012, was largely an internal affair.	第一阶段大概在2011年1月至2012年3月，这一阶段大体上是叙利亚内部事务。
When the Arab Spring erupted in Tunisia and Egypt in January 2011, protests erupted in Syria as well.	当阿拉伯之春于2011年1月在突尼斯和埃及爆发时，叙利亚也爆发了游行示威。
In addition to the usual grievances under a brutal regime, Syrians were reeling from a massive drought and soaring food prices.	除了常规的对暴政政权的仇恨外，叙利亚人还饱受大规模干旱和食品价格飙升的挤压。
The protests became a military rebellion when parts of the Syrian army broke with the regime and established the Free Syrian Army.	随着一部分叙利亚军队与政权决裂，成立自由叙利亚军（Free Syrian Army ） ， 游行示威演变成了军事起义。
Neighboring Turkey was probably the first outside country to support the rebellion on the ground, giving sanctuary to rebel forces along its border with Syria.	邻国土耳其可能是第一个从地面支持叛军的外国，它沿土叙边境为叛军提供庇护所。
Although the violence was escalating, the death toll was still in the thousands, not tens of thousands.	尽管暴力升级，但死亡人数仍只有几千人，而没有达到万人级别。
The second phase began when the US helped to organize a large group of countries to back the rebellion.	第二阶段始于美国帮助组织起一大群国家支持叛军。
At a meeting of foreign ministers in Istanbul on April 1, 2012, the US and other countries pledged active financial and logistical support for the Free Syrian Army.	在2012年4月1日举行的伊斯坦布尔外交部长会议上，美国和其他国家承诺为自由叙利亚军提供金融和物流支持。
Most important, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared: “We think Assad must go.”	最重要的是，时任美国国务卿希拉里·克林顿宣称“我们认为巴沙尔必须下台 。 ”
That open-ended statement, without any clear means to achieve the goal that it announced, has done much to fuel military escalation and the rising death toll in Syria, while pushing the US repeatedly to defend its “credibility” against a line in the sand that it should not have drawn.	这一陈述颇为含糊，并没有给出实现这一目标的手段，结果导致了叙利亚军事冲突升级和死亡人数暴增，同时也给美国自己划了一条毫无必要的底线，使其不得不一再捍卫自己的“信誉 ” 。
Then and now, the US has claimed to speak in the interest of the Syrian people.	从那时到现在，美国一直声称代表叙利亚人民的利益。
This is very doubtful.	这十分可疑。
The US views Syria mainly through the lens of Iran, seeking to depose Assad in order to deprive Iran’s leaders of an important ally in the region, one that borders Israel.	美国看待叙利亚的角度大体是站在伊朗问题的基础上，它之所以寻求推翻巴沙尔，是为了除掉伊朗领导人在中东的一个重要盟友，一个与以色列接壤的盟友。
The US-led effort in Syria is thus best understood as a proxy war with Iran – a cynical strategy that has contributed to the massive rise in violence.	于是，对美国领导的叙利亚任务的最合适的理解是，这是一场与伊朗的代理人战争 — — 这一颇可质疑的战略导致了暴力的严重升级。
The US government’s misguided move from potential mediator and problem solver to active backer of the Syrian insurrection was, predictably, a terrible mistake.	美国政府从潜在的调停人和问题解决者变成了叙利亚暴动的积极支持者。 不难预测，这一是个严重的错误。
It put the US in effective opposition to the United Nations peace initiative then being led by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, whose approach was to call for a ceasefire followed by a negotiated political transition.	这使美国事实上违反了由前秘书长科菲·安南领导的联合国维和措施。 安南的办法是呼吁停火，然后进行政治转型谈判。
The US preempted this process by backing the military rebellion and insisting on Assad’s immediate departure.	美国则操之过急，支持叛军并坚持巴沙尔必须立刻下台。
It is hard to understand this blunder.	美国的这一错误令人难以理解。
Even if the US ultimately sought to force Assad from office, its blunt action hardened Assad’s resistance, as well as that of his two allies in the UN Security Council, Russia and China.	即使美国的最终目的是迫使巴沙尔下台，其迫不及待的举动也会增加巴沙尔的抵抗，并且触犯其在联合国安理会的两大盟友俄罗斯和中国。
Aside from seeking to defend their own interests in the region, both countries understandably rejected the idea of US-led regime change in Syria.	不难理解，中俄两国除了寻求捍卫其自身在中东的利益外，还 否决了由美国领导叙利亚体制变革的方案。
Russia argued that America’s insistence on Assad’s immediate departure was an impediment to peace.	俄罗斯认为美国的坚持巴沙尔立刻下台是在阻止和平。
In this, Russia was right.	在这一点上，俄罗斯是正确的。
Indeed, Russia was playing a plausibly constructive role at the time, albeit one premised on Assad remaining in power for at least a transitional period, if not indefinitely.	事实上，当时俄罗斯所扮演的角色颇具建设性，尽管其先决条件是巴沙尔政权即使不能用就延续，至少在过渡期仍应该在台上。
Russia sought a pragmatic approach that would protect its commercial interests in Syria and its naval base at the port of Tartus, while bringing an end to the bloodletting.	俄罗斯追求的是一种务实方案，以保护其在叙利亚的商业利益和其在塔尔图斯港的军事基地，同时还能结束流血。
The Russians openly backed Annan’s peace initiative.	俄罗斯人公开支持安南的和平计划。
Yet, with the US and others financing the rebels, Russia (and Iran) supplied more – and more sophisticated – weapons to the regime.	但是，由于美国和其他国家为叛军提供金融支持，俄罗斯（和伊朗）向巴沙尔政权提供了更多、也更先进的武器。
Now, with the use of chemical weapons, probably by the Syrian government (and possibly by both sides), the US has again ratcheted up the stakes.	如今，化学武器的使用（可能是叙利亚政府，也可能是双方都用了）使得美国再次加大了赌注。
Bypassing the UN once again, the US is declaring its intention to intervene directly by bombing Syria, ostensibly to deter the future use of chemical weapons.	美国再次绕过联合国，宣布准备通过轰炸叙利亚直接进行干预 — — 表面借口是为了阻止进一步使用化学武器。
America’s motivations are not entirely clear.	美国的动机并不十分明确。
Perhaps there is no underlying foreign-policy logic, but only carelessness.	也许其中并无外交政策基本逻辑，而只是疏忽。
If there is a kind of logic, however weak, it seems to revolve around Iran and Israel, rather than Syria per se.	如果有某种逻辑，那么不管多么弱，都必然是以伊朗和以色列而不是以叙利亚为核心的。
There are many dictatorships in the world that the US does not try to overthrow.	世界上有许多独裁体制美国都没有去试图推翻。
On the contrary, many of them are ostensibly America’s close allies.	相反，其中不少表面上还是美国的紧密盟友。
So why does the US continue to back a deadly rebellion in a civil war that is continuing to escalate dangerously, now to the point of chemical-weapons attacks?	因此美国为何要在正在继续危险发酵的内战中支持叛军，如今甚至找出了化学武器攻击的借口？
To put it simply, President Barack Obama’s administration has inherited the neoconservative philosophy of regime change in the Middle East.	简言之，总统奥巴马政府继承了针对中东政权变革的新保守主义思想。
The overriding idea is that the US and its close allies get to choose who governs in the region.	其最重要的出发点是美国及其紧密盟友来选择谁主导这一地区。
Assad must go not because he is authoritarian, but because he is allied with Iran, which, from the perspective of the US, Israel, Turkey, and several Gulf countries, makes him a regional threat.	巴沙尔之所以必须下台，不是因为他独裁，而是因为它与伊朗结盟，在美国、以色列、土耳其和一些海湾国家看来，这让巴沙尔成为了地区威胁。
In fact, the US has probably been lured into serving these countries’ own narrower interests, whether it be Israel’s unconvincing vision of its own security or the Sunni countries’ opposition to Shia Iran.	事实上，美国可能被这些国家自身的狭隘利益所利用，不管是以色列对其自身安全的无法令人信服的愿景还是逊尼派国家队什叶派伊朗的反对。
But, in the long term, US foreign policy divorced from international law cannot produce anything other than more war.	但是，从长期看，美国违背国际法的外交政策不可能产生除了更多战争之外的结果。
The US should reverse course.	美国需要转变方向。
A direct US attack on Syria without UN backing is far more likely to inflame the region than it is to resolve the crisis there – a point well appreciated in the United Kingdom, where Parliament bucked the government by rejecting British participation in a military strike.	在没有联合国的支持下直接对叙利亚进行打击极有可能点燃地区战火，而不是解决危机 — — 英国充分认识到了这一点，其议会否决了政府关于英国参与军事打击的动议。
Instead, the US should provide evidence of the chemical attacks to the UN; call on the Security Council to condemn the perpetrators; and refer such violations to the International Criminal Court.	相反，美国应该把化学攻击的证据提供给联合国；要求安理会谴责袭击者；并将这些罪行诉诸国际刑事法庭。
Moreover, the Obama administration should try to work with Russia and China to enforce the Chemical Weapons Convention.	此外，奥巴马政府应该试图与俄罗斯和中国合作强制执行化学武器公约。
If the US fails in this, while acting diplomatically and transparently (without a unilateral attack), Russia and China would find themselves globally isolated on this important issue.	如果美国已透明的外交手段这样做（而不是单方面打击）而遭到了失败，那么中俄两国会在这一重要问题上被全球所孤立。
More broadly, the US should stop using countries like Syria as proxies against Iran.	更广泛地说，美国应该停滞利用叙利亚等国家作为反对伊朗的代理。
Withdrawal of US financial and logistical support for the rebellion, and calling on others to do the same, would not address Syria’s authoritarianism or resolve America’s issues with Iran, but it would stop or greatly reduce the large-scale killing and destruction in Syria itself.	撤回美国对叛军的金融和物流支持、呼吁其他国也这样做无法解决叙利亚的独裁主义或解决美国与伊朗的问题，但能停止或极大地减少叙利亚本国的大规模杀伤和破坏。
It would also enable the UN peace process to resume, this time with the US and Russia working together to restrain violence, keep Al Qaeda at bay (a shared interest), and find a longer-term pragmatic solution to Syria’s deep domestic divisions.	美国还可以重启联合国和平进程，由美国和俄罗斯携手阻止暴力、防范基地组织（符合两国共同利益）并寻找叙利亚深刻国内分歧的长期务实解决方案。
And the search for a US modus vivendi with Iran – where a new president suggests a change of course on foreign policy – could be revived.	此外，美国还应该重新开始寻找针对伊朗的权宜之计 — — 伊朗新总统的上任可能意味着外交政策的转变。
It is time for the US to help stop the killing in Syria.	美国应该帮助停滞叙利亚的杀戮。
That means abandoning the fantasy that it can or should determine who rules in the Middle East.	这意味着放弃它能够或应该决定谁主宰中东的幻想。
	
Diplomacy and Double Standards	外交和双重标准
CANBERRA – When does acceptable diplomatic caution and realism become indefensible abdication of moral standards?	堪培拉—可接受的外交警告和现实主义何时变成了站不住脚的不顾道德标准？
Not everyone on the foreign-policy frontline cares, but those who do often face deeply uncomfortable choices.	并非所有外交界人士都在乎这一点，但在乎这一点的，通常要面临令人极度不安的选择。
Negotiating a life-saving peace may mean giving amnesty to the murderously guilty.	谈判救命的和平可能意味着给予罪大恶极者赦免。
Living with tyranny might be less life-threatening than embracing anarchy.	生活在暴政中可能比接受无政府状态对生命的威胁更小。
Calming a volatile situation may mean not publicly denouncing behavior that cries out for condemnation.	平息动荡局势可能意味着不公开谴责应该被定罪的行为。
Making the right call is more difficult in the real world than in a philosophy classroom.	在现实中发出正确的声音比在哲学教室中更难。
But sometimes the line really is crossed, all relevant players know it, and the consequences are potentially profound.	但有时这条线真的会被越过，所有相关方都知道这一点，而且后果可能影响深远。
The United States’ failure so far to cut off its military aid to Egypt in response to the regime’s massacre of hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood supporters, in the streets and in prisons, is as clear a recent case as one can find.	美国至今没有因为军队在街头和监狱中屠杀数百名穆斯林兄弟会支持者而砍掉其对埃及的军事援助，这是人人都看到的最新例子。
Former President Mohamed Morsi’s government was a catastrophic failure – ruthlessly ideological, economically illiterate, and constitutionally irresponsible.	前总统穆尔西政府是一场灾难性的失败 — — 意识形态上冷酷无情，经济上完全外行，宪政上又不可靠。
It deeply polarized a society yearning for a new inclusiveness.	它将一个渴望新的包容性的社会深深地极化了。
But, had the army held its nerve – and triggers – there is every reason to believe that Morsi would have been voted out in the next election.	但是，如果军队保持冷静 — — 并且管住扳机 — — 有充分的理由相信穆尔西在下一次选举中将被选下台。
If the Muslim Brotherhood denied a ballot, or refused to accept defeat, tougher measures could then have been contemplated.	如果穆斯林兄弟会否认投票结果，或拒绝接受被击败的事实，此时再采取更严厉的措施不迟。
As it is, the army’s coup was indefensible, and its slaughter of mostly unarmed protesters ranks in infamy with the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989, and those of Libya’s former leader, Muammar el-Qaddafi, and Syria’s Hafez and Bashar al-Assad.	军队的政变是站不住脚的，其对大多手无寸铁的示威者的屠杀堪与1989年天安门事件以及利比亚前领导人卡扎菲和叙利亚的哈菲兹和巴沙尔等人的暴行相提并论。
It is not as if maintaining its $1.3 billion in annual military aid gives the US any leverage over Egypt’s behavior.	维持每年13亿美元的军事援助并没有让美国获得任何左右埃及行为的能力。
It might have once, but the amount now pales in significance next to the $12 billion in economic assistance recently rushed to the generals by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates.	它或许曾经获得过，但如今埃及将军们从沙特、科威特和阿联酋那里获得了120美元的经济援助，让美国的援助相形见绌。
Certainly, the regime would resent withdrawal of this aid, as would most of the Brotherhood’s civilian opponents; but that matters less than the impact on American credibility, in the Middle East and the rest of the world, of not doing so.	显然，若撤销这一援助，埃及军方将会记仇，大部分穆兄会的平民反对者也是如此；但更大的影响是不这么做会对美国在中东和世界其他地区的信誉构成冲击。
Unless political leaders know that tearing up the rule book on the scale seen in Egypt will expose them to more than rhetorical consequences, the tacit message – that regimes that pick the “right” targets can repress at will – will resonate in Bahrain, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia, not to mention Syria.	除非政治领导人知道，像埃及如此规模的破坏规则，给他们带来的后果不仅仅是暴露于辞令上的抨击之下，还有大家心照不宣的信息 — — 军方可以随意选择“正确”的目标进行镇压 — — 这会在巴林、也门和沙特引起共振，更不用说叙利亚了。
Farther afield, the US risks reinforcing the perception that it is comfortable with double standards.	往更远的地方说，美国也有被坐实安然接受双重标准的风险。
For a country whose global leadership depends as much on its soft power as on its military might, that is dynamite.	美国的全球领导力取决于软实力的程度不亚于武力，因此这具有爆炸性的后果。
The charge sheet here is already rather full, with multiple instances in recent years of America being almost universally regarded as not practicing what it preaches.	在这方面，美国的案底已经相当多，近年来，很多例子表明美国几乎总是说一套做一套。
For starters, there was the invasion of Iraq in 2003: Embracing the United Nations Security Council when you get your way, but bypassing it when you don’t, does not do much to encourage a cooperative rule-based international order.	首先是2003年入侵伊拉克：联合国安理会批准你时就与安理会合作，安理会不批准就绕开它，这对合作性的、以规则为基础的国际秩序来说可不是好榜样。
Then there was the Palestinian election of 2006: Promoting democracy generates ridicule when it extends only to elections that produce palatable winners, as Gaza’s vote for Hamas did not.	接着是2006年巴勒斯坦选举：推进民主最后成了笑柄，因为它只扩展到产生了合意获胜者的选举，加沙选出哈马斯却不被承认。
Or, again in the Middle East, there has been the blind eye endlessly turned to Israel’s actual possession of nuclear weapons, in contrast to the response to Iran’s possible early moves in that direction.	还有，同样是在中东，美国对以色列实际拥有核武器视而不见，而对伊朗有核化的可能早期举动一惊一乍。
And there was the 2008 agreement to trade nuclear material and technology with India, despite its unwillingness to accept serious new disarmament or non-proliferation commitments.	还有2008年同意与印度交易核材料和技术，尽管后者不愿接受严肃的新削减核武器和核不扩散承诺。
To be fair to the US, such double standards abound among other major powers as well.	平心而论，美国的这些双重标准在其他大国身上也存在。
Russia’s invocation of the “responsibility to protect” to justify its 2008 invasion of Georgia was met with incredulity at the time, and rendered even more cynical by its resolute failure since 2011 to condemn the Syrian regime for mass-atrocity crimes against its own people.	2008年俄罗斯借口“保护责任”入侵格鲁吉亚就受到了质疑，而自2011年以来，俄罗斯断然拒绝谴责叙利亚政府对本国人民犯下了严重大规模伤害罪行，这引起了更多的抨击。
China’s strategic aspirations in the South China Sea, and its unwillingness to embrace a maritime code of conduct there, sit uncomfortably with its stated concern for sovereign boundaries and the peaceful resolution of territorial disputes.	中国在南海的战略雄心，及其不愿用海洋法解决南海问题，都与其关注主权边界和和平解决领土争端的说法不符。
And every one of the nuclear-armed states has been guilty of “do as I say, not as I do” in insisting on non-proliferation while making no serious commitment to disarmament.	每个有核国家都有“照我说的做，别照我做的做”的罪��，在坚持核不扩散的同时不愿许下严肃的核裁军承诺。
To be fair to diplomatic policymakers everywhere, it is often the case that hard choices between competing moral values – for example, justice and peace – simply have to be made.	平心而论，各国外交决策者经常必须在相互矛盾的道德价值之间 — — 比如公正和和平 — — 做出艰难抉择。
And positions that are claimed to embody double standards are often nothing of the kind.	被认为采纳双重标准的立场通常不是此类。
A good example is the allegation that the “responsibility to protect” principle is inherently flawed, because the major powers will always be immune from intervention, not only because five of them can exercise a Security Council veto, but also because of their inherent military strength.	一个很好的例子是指责“保护责任”原则具有天然缺陷，因为大国永远对干涉免疫，不仅是因为五常拥有安理会否决权，也是因为它们所具有的的军事优势。
But this ignores the principle that no military intervention will ever be legitimate unless it satisfies, among other criteria, the test of diminishing, not augmenting, human suffering. And going to war against any of the major powers to protect a suffering minority would certainly trigger a much wider conflagration.	但这忽略了一个原则：军事干预永远是不合法的，除非它经受减少而不是增加人道灾难的考验，并且符合其他一系列标准。 而为了保护受难的少数派而向大国选战必然会触发更大的战火。
The bottom line is that values matter in international relations, and states that place great emphasis on the promotion of values are extremely vulnerable to charges of hypocrisy.	总之，价值在国际关系中有作用，极力强调推进价值的国家极易受到伪善的指责。
No state that aspires to win the support or cooperation of others can afford to be seen to be comfortable with unambiguous double standards.	没有哪个想赢得他国支持和合作的国家能接受被视为安然采取暧昧的双重标准的国家。
And worst of all is to be perceived as being soft on those who, like Egypt’s current military rulers, commit mass-atrocity crimes against their own citizens.	其中最糟糕的指责要数对那些犯有针对本国人民的大规模暴行的人立场软弱 — — 比如埃及目前的军事统治者。
	
Why America Will Lead the “Asian Century”	美国为什么能够领导“亚洲世纪”
SINGAPORE – Not a week passes, it seems, without a big-picture thinker releasing a big-picture book or giving a big-picture sermon describing the gradual eclipse of American hegemony in Asia.	新加坡 — — 似乎每个礼拜都有一位着眼于全局的思想家发表一部着眼于全局的著作，或者进行一次着眼于全局的演讲，绘声绘色的描述美国逐步丧失亚洲霸权的过程。
True, American power will inevitably decline in relative terms as Asian giants such as China and India rise.	没错，随着中国和印度等亚洲巨人的崛起，美国的力量相对下降将成为一种不可避免的趋势。
But, at least as far as Asia is concerned, arguments about the end of American hegemony ring hollow.	但至少在亚洲这块土地上，有关美国霸权终结的论断显得空洞无力。
For one thing, the United States was never a hegemon in Asia.	首先，美国从来就不是亚洲霸主。
Only some American post-Cold War triumphalists thought it was.	只有美国冷战后某些胜利主义者才这样认为。
The nature of US power and the exercise of its influence was always much more clever and subtle than most assume.	美国权力的性质及其影响力的行使从来就比多数人想象中更明智、也更敏锐。
In fact, as India and China rise, the US could actually find itself in a stronger position.	事实上，随着印度和中国的崛起，美国在亚洲的地位可能会更加稳固。
How can this be?	为什么会是这样？
After all, power and influence are built on the back of economic success.	归根结底，经济领域的成功才是权力和影响力的根基。
The Chinese economy has been doubling in size every ten years since 1978.	中国经济总量从1978年以后每10年都以翻番的速度增长。
The Indian economy has been doing the same since 1991.	而印度经济从1991年后也实现了同样的增长速度。
In contrast, it takes about two decades for the US economy to double in size.	相反，美国经济翻番需要大约20年。
Doesn’t this surely mean that Asia is rushing toward a state of multi-polarity – a configuration of roughly equal great powers balancing against each other – while American influence is on the wane?	这难道不意味着亚洲正快速实现多极化 — — 形成大致对等的强国相互制约的格局 — — 同时美国的影响力正在日益削弱？
The seemingly obvious conclusion would be true but for the fact that Asia has a unique kind of hierarchical security system that came about partly by accident and partly by design.	如果不是部分出于偶然部分出于设计的亚洲独特的多级安全体系，这个看上去似乎显而易见的结论可能会是真的。
No power can be preeminent if it cannot maintain its military advantage over rivals.	如果不能相对于对手保持军事优势，就没有哪个大国能够一枝独秀。
Yet, despite the fact that America spends more on defense than the next ten powers combined, it has never been a regional hegemon because it actually relies on the cooperation of other states to remain predominant.	不过尽管美国在国防领域的开支超过紧随其后的十大强国，但它从来没有成为地区霸主，因为它实际上有赖于其他国家的合作来维持其优势地位。
Without cooperation from allies such as Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and the Philippines, the US could not retain its forward military positions in the West Pacific.	没有日本、韩国、新加坡、菲律宾等盟国的合作，美国就无法在西太平洋保持其先进的军事地位。
Likewise, the US needs the cooperation of Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand to host its critical radar infrastructure.	同样，美国需要印尼、马来西亚和泰国的合作，来容纳其至关重要的雷达设施。
Moreover, in remaining preeminent, America requires other key states and regional groupings, such as ASEAN, to acquiesce in its security relationships.	此外，为保持优势地位，美国需要其他重要国家和东盟等地区组织对其安全关系持默许态度。
Thus, there is broad-based regional approval of US alliances with Japan, South Korea, and Australia, as well as with partners such as the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and India.	因此，亚洲地区已经就美国与日本、韩国和澳大利联盟以及与菲律宾、新加坡、泰国和印度的伙伴关系达成了的广泛共识。
The key to the effectiveness of these bilateral relationships is that they enjoy widespread support (and thus legitimacy) in the region as stabilizing arrangements.	上述双边关系有效性的关键之处在于它们在区域内享有非常广泛的支持（以及合法性 ） ， 被公认为是维护稳定的因素。
The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.	且加在一起的维稳效果大于各部分之和。
Combined with the raw military capacity that the US brings to the table, this means that America is powerful enough to enforce the peace and provide stability for commerce to thrive.	与美国的强硬军力相结合，这意味着美国拥有足够的力量维护和平与稳定，并实现商业繁荣。
America’s presence and bilateral partnerships are complementary to Asian states’ obsession with counter-dominance and non-interference in the region.	美国的势力和双边合作关系构成了对亚洲国家在本地区内反控制反干涉目标的补充。
This dynamic “liberal order” – largely fair, flexible, and open enough to welcome new entrants as they rise – will continue to serve Asia well.	这种动态的“自由秩序”将继续在亚洲起到很好的作用，它在大体上做到了公平、灵活、开放，而且欢迎新崛起的国家加入。
For example, even China has been a major beneficiary of the public goods provided by the US-led hierarchical system.	举例来讲，就连中国都成为由美国领导的多级安全体系的主要受益者。
This interdependent relationship means that the US is not so powerful, that it can readily ignore the wishes of key states, and it is here that its apparent weakness is actually strength.	这种相互依存的关系意味着美国并没有强大到可以轻易无视关键国家的愿望，也正是在这方面，这种表面看上去的弱点其实正是其优势所在。
America is not a Hobbesian Leviathan with absolute authority and power.	美国不是霍布斯哲学中手握绝对权力的集权主义庞然大物。
Indeed, China’s strategists are frequently puzzled by the lack of “balancing” that takes place against the US in the region.	实际上，亚洲地区在对美问题上“平衡”的缺乏经常困扰着中国的战略学者。
But it is puzzling only if we characterize Asia as being multi-polar rather than hierarchical.	但只有当我们把亚洲看作多极化而非多级体系的时候，这个问题才令人感到困惑。
In fact, any balancing tends to take place in order to preserve the hierarchy, not to replace or supersede it.	事实上，任何平衡行为的出现都是为了 保护 这种多级体系，而不是接替或者取代它。
Other states tend to resist bids by any Asian power – be it Japan, China or India – to rise to the top of the pyramid.	其他国家似乎对任何亚洲国家，无论是日本、中国还是印度上升到金字塔顶端的努力抱有一种抗拒的态度。
As a foreign-based power, the US needs the cooperation of Asian partners.	作为一股外来力量，美国需要得到亚洲伙伴的合作。
This keeps the top dog in check.	这使得领头者必须受到约束。
Were an Asian country like China to rise to the top, it would not need the same level of regional cooperation and acquiescence to maintain its position and military footholds.	如果一个中国这样的亚洲国家坐上头把交椅，它不会需要同样水平的地区合作和认可来保持自己的地位，或拥有军事上的立足之处。
As China and India rise, and Japan becomes more “normal,” they will balance each other within the US-led hierarchy to ensure that the US remains on top and one or the other doesn’t dominate.	随着中国和印度的崛起，以及日本逐渐“正常化 ” ， 它们将会在美国领导的多级体系中相互制衡，保证由美国占据领导地位，其他任何国家都无法成为主导。
If China makes a bid for regional hegemony, it will find it difficult to resist the structural constraints placed on it within this hierarchy.	如果中国试图争取地区霸权，它会发现在现有多级制度下的结构性限制很难克服。
US power is in relative decline, but that is no bad thing.	美国的权力正在相对衰落，但这并不是什么坏事。
False triumphalism breeds poor discipline.	虚假的必胜信念带来纪律上的松弛。
But a sense of strategic vulnerability breeds interdependency, which has always been the key to successful US leadership in Asia.	但战略上的脆弱感却能促进相互依赖，而这正是美国成功领导亚洲的关键所在。
	
China without North Korea	不再支持朝鲜的中国
NOTTINGHAM – North Korea’s third nuclear test is a game changer not only for the United States and Japan, but also for the regime’s last ally, China.	发自诺丁汉 — — 朝鲜的第三次核试验不仅对美国和日本来说改变了游戏规则，对其仅剩的盟友中国来说也是如此。
The official Chinese reaction to North Korea’s latest provocation was stern: China is “strongly dissatisfied and resolutely opposed” to the test, and it is calling for the resumption of international talks.	对朝鲜的最新挑衅中国官方反应极为严厉：中国对核试验“表示强烈不满并坚决反对 ” ， 并呼吁重启国际谈判。
But China’s stance lacks meaningful bite, because its leaders fail to recognize that they no longer need to succumb to their unruly neighbor’s blackmail.	但这一立场却并未造成任何重大影响，因为中国领导人依然未能意识到：他们已经没必要再继续屈从于这个恶邻居的讹诈了。
In carrying out the test, the North Koreans have once again compromised China’s national interests.	通过这场核实验，朝鲜再一次损害了中国的国家利益。
The international community is again firmly focused on China’s relationship with its rogue ally, and expects that, as an emerging superpower seeking to reassure the world of its peaceful rise, China will play a constructive role.	国际社会又开始密切关注中国与其难以控制的盟友之间的关系，并希望中国作为一个想要向世界昭示自身和平崛起的新兴超级大国能发挥建设性的作用。
However limited China’s influence may be, the North Korean regime can sustain itself only with Chinese backing.	不管中国的影响是多么有限，朝鲜政权只有在中国的支持下才得以维持下去。
With North Korea’s latest nuclear test coming so quickly after its rocket launch in December, the United Nations has good reason to ask China, a permanent Security Council member, to take the diplomatic lead.	鉴于朝鲜在去年12月发射火箭后如此短的时间内又再度进行核试验，联合国有充分的理由要求中国这个常任理事国带头发起外交行动。
It is simply not enough for China to call, as its official statement does, for the resumption of the Six-Party Talks with South Korea, China, the US, Japan, and Russia.	仅仅呼吁朝鲜重启六方会谈（与韩国、中国、美国、日本和俄罗斯 ） — —正如中方的官方声明那样 — — 是不够的。
That framework has been thoroughly discredited by North Korea’s repeated violation of past agreements.	由于朝鲜屡次推翻过去的协议，六方会谈框架早已毫无信誉可言了。
China must warn North Korea that it will not be pressured into providing support even when Chinese national interests have been undermined.	中国必须警告朝鲜：它宁可让自身国家利益受损也不会为朝鲜提供帮助。
Indeed, China should make clear that, much as it would prefer North Korea to survive and prosper, it could afford to allow its erstwhile ally to implode.	事实上，中国应当表明态度，尽管也很希望朝鲜能继续存在并走向繁荣，但倘若后者一意孤行，它也有能力承担这个昔日盟友土崩瓦解的后果。
Simply put, the conventional wisdom that North Korea’s collapse would be disastrous for China is misconceived.	简而言之，认为朝鲜瓦解会给中国带来灾难性影响的一般理念是错误的。
Any crisis sparked by North Korean refugees fleeing across the Chinese border would be short-lived, and international assistance would be readily available.	由涌入中国边境的朝鲜难民引发的所有危机都是暂时的，而且也很容易得到国际援助。
Likewise, China need not fear a South Korea-led unification of the peninsula.	同样，中国不需要担心韩国会牵头促进朝鲜半岛统一。
China already enjoys a smoother relationship with the South than it does with the North.	中国与韩国的关系现在比它与朝鲜的关系要平稳顺利。
Unification would occupy the Korean people for the next two decades, with Japan and the US compelled to inject a huge amount of aid to rebuild and reintegrate the North.	半岛统一能让朝鲜半岛上的人们忙上二十年，而日本和美国在此期间将不得不注入大量的援助来重建并整合北朝鲜。
This hardly runs counter to China’s interests as it continues its own advance toward becoming the world’s largest economy.	这几乎不会伤及中国的利益，也无碍其走向世界第一经济大国的进程。
Indeed, if this process were to unfold, the US rationale for keeping its own military forces in South Korea would disappear.	的确，如果这个进程被展开，美国就不再有理由继续在韩国驻军。
A phased reduction of the American presence would follow.	接下来就是分阶段的美军撤退。
If the US wished to maintain bases in Korea in the longer term, it would have to secure permission from a proud and newly united Korean nation – hardly a forgone conclusion.	如果美国想要在朝鲜半岛继续安插军事基地，就需要征得扬眉吐气且新近统一的朝鲜国许可 — — 但这几乎是不可能的。
Moreover, a united Korea will have inherited the North’s nuclear weapons.	此外，统一后的朝鲜国将会继承前朝鲜的核武器。
This will pose challenges to US-Korea relations, which should work to China’s advantage.	这将对美国与新政权之间的关系提出了挑战，却对中国有利。
The US will remain committed to de-nuclearizing the peninsula, while the Korean government will be tempted to retain the North’s nuclear capabilities.	美国将会继续致力于对朝鲜半岛进行去核武器化，而新政权则倾向于保留上述核能力。
This strain further reduces the risk of having US troops stationed on the Korean side of China’s border.	这就进一步降低了美军驻扎在中朝边境朝鲜一侧的风险。
China must also consider the implications of North Korea’s actions on its own fractious relations with Japan.	中国也必须考虑朝鲜的行为对中日紧张关系的影响。
Chinese President Xi Jinping’s top foreign-policy priority is to force the Japanese government to acknowledge, if not accept, China’s territorial claims in the two countries’ dispute over the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands in the East China Sea.	中国国家主席习近平的外交政策最高方略是迫使日本政府承认 — — 如果不是接受的话 — — 中国对东海上有争议的钓鱼岛/尖阁列岛的领土要求。
Chinese naval ships have already trained their weapons on a Japanese destroyer and a Japanese naval helicopter.	为此中国军舰已经把炮口瞄准了一艘日本驱逐舰和一架日本海军直升机。
In these incidents, the single most important reason for Japanese restraint has been its military’s own rules of engagement.	而在这些事件中，日本一直因其军事交战规则而保持克制。
Under current law, Japanese security forces are forbidden from firing their weapons unless clearly fired upon, which means that the country’s Maritime Self-Defense Force vessels can do little when targeted by Chinese naval radar.	根据现行法律，日本保安部队除非遭到攻击，否则不能主动开火，这就意味着日本海军自卫队舰艇即便遭到中国海军火控雷达照射也只能束手无策。
And revising the rules to allow Japan’s military to, say, destroy a North Korean missile before it reaches Japanese air space would increase the risk of conflict between Chinese and Japanese naval and air forces.	而一旦修改规则允许日本军方在朝鲜导弹到达领空之前将其击落的话，中日海空军间爆发冲突的风险必然随之增大。
If the Chinese leadership can think beyond its usual default response to North Korean misbehavior – abstract condemnation followed by a call for dialogue – it can apply real pressure on the North Korean regime in full view of the international community.	如果中国领导人的想法能超越其对朝鲜违约行为的一贯回应 — — 抽象的谴责及要求举行对话 — — 就能在国际社会面前对朝鲜政权施加真正的压力。
North Korea’s last ally should give it one last chance. And then it should be prepared to pull the plug.	作为朝鲜的最后一个盟友，中国只能给朝鲜最后一次机会，并且随时准备终止两国之间的关系。
	
Apple’s Cash-Flow Problem	苹果的现金流问题
CAMBRIDGE – I recently examined the problem of corporate short-termism from two nonstandard angles.	美国剑桥—最近我用两个非标准角度解释了企业短视的问题。
One was that some short-termism is sensible.	一是某些短视是明智的。
Large firms face an increasingly fluid economic, technological, and political environment – owing to more global and competitive markets, to the greater potential of technological change to alter firms’ business environment, and to governments’ growing influence over what makes business sense.	大企业面临着日以多变的经济、技术和政治环境 — — 其原因包括日渐全球化、竞争日渐激烈的市场、技术变化改变企业经营环境潜力的日渐提高以及政府对商业利益影响的日渐增加。
In this fluid environment, large companies must be cautious before making large, long-term commitments.	在这一多变的环境下，大公司必须在做出长期大型决策之前三思而后行。
Second, I described how emerging data could suggest measurement problems with the conventional wisdom that more rapid trading in financial markets is making them more oriented to the short term than ever before.	第二，我描述了新出现的数据如何意味着传统智慧 — — 更快的金融市场交易让它们比以前更加偏向于短视 — — 的度量问题。
Proponents of this view point to furious trading in New York and London, with average holding periods for major stocks diminishing in recent decades.	这一观点的支持者指出，纽约和伦敦交易频繁，大公司股票的平均持有期在最近几十年来逐步缩短。
In fact, the change may be driven by a rapidly trading minority, and not by major stockholders shortening their holding periods.	事实上，这一变化可能是由一小撮快速交易者导致的，而不是因大股东缩短持有期造成的。
Indeed, the average holding period for America’s core shareholders, like Fidelity and Vanguard, has increased in recent decades.	事实上，美国核心股东 — — 如富达基金公司和先锋基金公司 — — 在最近几十年里平均持有期有所增加。
(I examine these issues in greater depth in a longer forthcoming article.)	（我将在更长的后续文章中深度解释这一问题 ） 。
The shareholder activism around Apple highlights the importance and controversy of the short-term problem.	围绕苹果公司的股东积极主义凸显出短视问题的重要性和争议性。
Apple has been spectacularly successful in the past decade.	苹果公司在过去十年中取得了令人惊异的成功。
Its products, from iPhones to iPads to MacBooks, have captured consumers’ imaginations, remade markets, and earned the company and its shareholders huge sums of money.	从iPhone到iPad再到MacBook，苹果公司的产品抓住了消费者的想象力，重新创造了市场，也为公司及其股东带来了大把利润。
Apple’s stock capitalization has soared, and it became the first trillion-dollar company.	苹果股票市值出现了飙升，成为首家万亿美元公司。
As Apple’s profits have grown, it has amassed $137 billion in cash, according to a recent count – more than it can profitably use (at least for now) in its operations.	随着利润的增加，据最新统计，苹果囤积了1370亿美元现金 — — 超过了它能够盈利经营的规模（至少就目前而言 ） 。
So the company has wisely left its cash invested in global financial accounts, not business operations.	因此，苹果公司明智地把现金投资于全球金融账户而不是业务经营。
Meanwhile, its staggeringly successful products are generating still more cash to handle and stockpile.	与此同时，它大获成功的产品仍在源源不断地创造更多现金。
Enter shareholder activist David Einhorn, whose hedge fund Greenlight Capital has been pressing Apple to distribute a healthy fraction of that cash.	股东积极主义者大卫·埃因霍恩（David Einhorn）出场了。 他的对冲基金 — — 绿光资本（Greenlight Capital）一直施压苹果公司派发合适比例的现金。
Much commentary on the foray has been negative: Einhorn’s proposal is a short-run, financial-engineering idea for a company that has gone from success to success, it is said – American stock-market short-termism at its worst.	对于这一行为，许多评论持负面态度：埃因霍恩的建议是短视的金融工程思维，而其针对的是一家从成功走向成功的公司 — — 最糟糕的美国股市短视行为。
Maybe it is.	或许诚然如此。
Maybe investors are being too quick to pressure a great company.	或许投资者关于伟大公司的论断下得太草率了。
But, odd as it might seem, getting its cash out could be a good long-term strategy for Apple.	但是，尽管听起来十分奇怪，派发现金对于苹果公司来说或许是高明的长期战略。
There has long been a life cycle for firms: young firms innovate, are cash-hungry, and have to scramble for financing.	长期以来，企业的生命周期一直是：年轻公司具有创新性，短缺现金，不得不疲于融资。
Some succeed, sell their products, and find themselves pulling in more cash than they need.	一些企业获得了成功，卖出了产品，收入的现金超过了它们的需要。
Great companies take that cash and invest it in even better products, taking the firm to new heights.	伟大的公司收获这笔现金并投资于更优良的场频，把企业带向新高峰。
Apple has been one of those companies.	苹果就是这类公司之一。
But, inevitably, the firm’s technologies become standardized and commoditized.	但是，不可避免地，其技术会变得标准化和商品化。
New, hotter technologies come along, and the firm no longer attracts the best people to work for it, because, well, it’s no longer the next new thing.	新的、更火爆的技术会随之出现，企业无法吸引最优秀的人才为其工作，因为它已不再是伟大的新新事物。
New products stall, old products are not as profitable as they once were (because competitors figure out how to make something better), and markets and consumers move on.	新产品陷入停滞，老产品不再像过去那样盈利丰厚（因为竞争对手学会了如何让产品更好 ） ， 而市场和消费者会喜新厌旧。
Firms that reach that point, and that know themselves, then return more of their cash hoard to their investors, who invest it elsewhere.	走到这一步并了解自己的企业会把更多的所屯现金返还投资者，让投资者投资于别处。
In the 1980’s and 1990’s, large swaths of American industry – especially the domestic oil industry – faced this problem, described by the economist Michael Jensen as the managerial challenge of handling free cash flow well.	20是八九十年代，美国诸多行业 — — 特别是国内石油行业 — — 面临着这一问题，经济学家迈克尔·延森（Michael Jensen）将这描述为合理处理自由现金流的管理挑战。
Where is Apple in that company life cycle?	苹果公司现在位于生命周期的哪个位置？
Is it still in its youth, cash-starved with more ideas than it can finance?	仍处于年轻的、新思想比融资能力发展更快因而困于现金的阶段？
Is it middle-aged, but nimble and able to remake itself, as it did several times during Steve Jobs’ tenure?	还是中年期但仍然相当灵活能够自我再生的阶段（就像乔布斯主政时期多次发生的那样 ） ？
Does it need $137 billion to engineer and finance a large-scale Apple TV that will be even more successful than iPhones and iPads?	它需要1370亿美元启动和融资大规模苹果电视并使其比iPhone和iPad更成功？
Or has the company peaked?	或者，苹果公司已经达到了巅峰期？
Could the rollout last fall of the inferior Apple Maps, which sent people to the wrong destination – causing severe public embarrassment and leading to a managerial shakeup – foreshadow a time when Apple’s best days are behind it?	去年秋天苹果地图的拙劣表现把许多人引向了错误的方向，造成了严重的公众不满和一次管理层地震，这是否意味着苹果的最好时代已经过去了？
The company could be at a high plateau and could stay there for years, even decades, but does it really need $137 billion in cash for new investments?	苹果公司可能已经登上高原并在此停留多年甚至几十年，但它是否真需要1370亿美元做新投资？
Here is another way of looking at the Apple problem: If Apple continues to succeed, won’t it generate the cash that it needs for innovation from its super-products, like the iPad, the iPhone, and the MacBook?	也可以从另一个角度看待苹果问题：如果苹果继续成功，它难道不能从它的巨星产品中 — — 如iPad、iPhone和MacBook — — 获得创新所需要的现金吗？
Roughly 70% of Apple’s revenues come from the iPhone and the iPad.	苹果公司大约七成的收入来自iPhone和iPad。
Will those products last, or will they be superseded?	这些产品会一直成功下去，还是会被取代？
Were those products’ success the result of a unique Apple asset, namely Steve Jobs, or is the company well positioned to produce the next big thing?	这些产品的成功是苹果独一无二的资产 — — 史蒂夫·乔布斯的结果，还是因为该公司在生产下一个热门产品的竞争中卡到了最佳身位？
Could it be too tempting in the short run to Apple’s management to have that $137 billion in the bank, so that it spends some or all of it on investments that fail to pan out in the long run?	短期诱惑会不会太大以至于苹果公司管理层不愿把这1370亿美元放在银行，而是把一部分甚至全部投资于无法获得长期成功的项目中？
It is at least possible – maybe even likely – that Apple’s best long-term move would be to release a hefty portion of its unused cash to its shareholders, who would then plow it back into the economy.	没准 — — 甚至极有可能 — — 苹果公司的最佳长期动作是把这笔未使用现金的一大部分拿出来还给股东，让后者把它们重新投入到经济中。
Meanwhile, it can finance its next new thing from the cash that its great products will continue to generate.	与此同时，它还可以通过伟大产品继续带来的现金为下一个热门产品融资。
What is being criticized as short-termism could well be a long-term financial strategy that is just right for Apple.	饱受批评的短视或许是正适合苹果公司的长期财务战略。
	
Why Are Good Policies Bad Politics?	好政策为何难过政治关？
BERKELEY – From the day after the collapse of Lehman Brothers last year, the policies followed by the United States Treasury, the US Federal Reserve, and the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama have been sound and helpful. The alternative – standing back and letting the markets handle things – would have brought America and the world higher unemployment than now exists.	伯克利－
Credit easing and support of the banking system helped significantly by preventing much worse.	
The fact that investment bankers did not go bankrupt last December and are profiting immensely this year is a side issue.	自去年雷曼兄弟银行倒闭之日起，美国财政部、美联储以及布什、奥巴马两届政府所奉行的政策一直是稳健有益的。
Every extra percentage point of unemployment lasting for two years costs $400 billion.	如果政府部门袖手旁观，任由市场左右局面，那么美国和世界当下的失业水平会更高。
A recession twice as deep as the one we have had would have cost the US roughly $2 trillion – and cost the world as a whole four times as much.	放松信贷和支持银行体系的政策避免了局势严重恶化，对经济大有助益。
In comparison, the bonuses at Goldman Sachs are a rounding error.	虽然投资银行家们去年12月没有倾家荡产，今年又赚得盆盈钵满，但这只是枝节问题。
And any attempt to make investment bankers suffer more last fall and winter would have put the entire support operation at risk.	失业率每增加一个百分点，并持续两年以上，就会造成4000亿美元的损失。
As Fed Vice Chairman Don Kohn said, ensuring that a few thousand investment bankers receive their just financial punishment is a non-starter when attempts to do so put the jobs of millions of Americans – and tens of millions outside the US – at risk.	如果经济衰退的深度达到本次衰退实际深度的两倍，美国就会遭受约2万亿美元的损失，而全世界的损失总额更会四倍于此。
The Obama administration’s fiscal stimulus has also significantly helped the economy.	相比之下，高盛的奖金如同四舍五入中的误差般无足轻重。
Though the jury is still out on the effect of the tax cuts in the stimulus, aid to states has been a job-saving success, and the flow of government spending on a whole variety of relatively useful projects is set to boost production and employment in the same way that consumer spending boosts production and employment.	去年秋冬时分，任何让投资银行家受到更大打击的尝试都会令整个经济救援行动面临风险。 正如美联储副主席唐·科恩（Don Kohn）所说，为了让区区几千名投资银行家在经济上受到应有的惩罚，就可能会使数以百万计的美国人和数以千万计的外国人丢掉工作，这种做法根本行不通。
And the cost of carrying the extra debt incurred is extraordinarily low: $12 billion a year of extra taxes would be enough to finance the fiscal-stimulus program at current interest rates.	奥巴马政府的财政刺激措施也对经济大有助益。 虽然其中减税措施的效力还难以判断，但联邦政府对各州的资助却成功地保住了大量就业。
For that price, American taxpayers will get an extra $1 trillion of goods and services, and employment will be higher by about ten million job-years.	而且，政府支出注入了众多颇为有益的项目，正如消费支出能够刺激生产和就业，这些政府支出同样会刺激生产和就业。
The valid complaints about fiscal policy over the past 14 months are not that it has run up the national debt and rewarded the princes of Wall Street, but rather that it has been too limited – that we ought to have done more.	而且，由此带来的新增债务的成本却低得出奇：在当前的利率之下，每年增税120亿美元就足以满足财政刺激项目的资金需求。
Yet these policies are political losers now: nobody is proposing more stimulus.	只需如此微薄的代价，美国纳税人就可以额外得到1万亿美元的产品与服务，每年额外增加的就业人数累计可达1000万。
This is strange, because usually when something works the natural impulse is to do it again.	如果说过去14个月间的财政政策确实有缺陷，那么缺陷并不在于增加国家负债和厚待华尔街骄子，而在于政策力度太小，我们原本可以做得更多。
Good policies that are boosting production and employment without causing inflation ought to be politically popular, right?	而今，这些政策却成了政治输家：现在无人提议采取更多刺激措施。
With respect to Obama’s stimulus package, it seems to me that there has been extraordinary intellectual and political dishonesty on the American right, which the press refuses to see.	说来不可思议，如果政策奏效，人们的本能反应往往是再做一次。 提振生产和就业而又不会引发通胀的好政策在政治上理应大受欢迎，不是吗？
For two and a half centuries, economists have believed that the flow of spending in an economy goes up whenever groups of people decide to spend more.	
Sometimes spending rises because there is more disposable cash in the economy, and sometimes because changes in opportunity costs – the cost of forgoing some other action, such as saving – make people want to spend the cash they have more rapidly. Sometimes and to some degree these increases show up as increases in prices, and sometimes and to some degree as increases in production and employment.	依我看，对于奥巴马的经济刺激措施，美国知识界和政界右翼人士的态度极不诚实，而媒体则对此视而不见。
But, whatever the cause or effect, spending always goes up whenever groups decide to spend more – and government decisions to spend more are as good as anybody else’s.	两个半世纪以来，经济学家一直认为，只要一些人群决定增加开支，那么经济体的支出流就会上升。
They are as good as the decisions of mortgage companies and new homebuyers to spend more on new houses during the housing bubble of the mid-2000’s, or of the princes of Silicon Valley to spend more building new companies during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990’s.	支出上升的原因有时在于可支配现金的增加，有时在于机会成本（即放弃某种做法、例如放弃储蓄的成本）的变化令人们愿意加快花钱的速度。 在某些时期以及某种程度上，支出的增长表现为物价上涨；在某些时期以及某种��度上，支出的增长又会表现为生产与就业的增长。
Obama’s Republican opponents, who claim that fiscal stimulus cannot work, rely on arguments that are incoherent at best, and usually simply wrong, if not mendacious.	然而，无论原因和效果如何，只要人们决定增加开支，经济体的支出总会增长 ― ― 和其他人一样，政府决定增加开支也是好事。
Remember that back in 1993, when the Clinton administration’s analyses led it to seek to spend less and reduce the deficit, the Republicans said that that would destroy the economy, too.	正如抵押贷款公司和购房者在2005年前后的住房泡沫时期决定增加购房支出，以及上世纪90年代末硅谷精英决定增加创业投资一样，增加开支的政府决策也是好事。
Such claims were as wrong then as they are now.	奥巴马的共和党对头声称，财政刺激措施不可能奏效，但他们的论证总免不了自相矛盾，而且，纵然不是说谎，也往往是大错特错。
But how many media reports make even a cursory effort to evaluate them?	回想1993年，克林顿政府经过分析，决定减少开支、削减赤字，当时共和党人同样声称其做法会摧毁美国经济。
A stronger argument, though not by much, is that the fiscal stimulus is boosting employment and production, but at too great a long-run cost because it has produced too large a boost in America's national debt. If interest rates on US Treasury securities were high and rising rapidly as the debt grew, I would agree with this argument.	正如现在一样，诸如此类的指责一向不合理。
But interest rates on US Treasury securities are very low and are not rising. Every single Treasury auction, at which the market gobbles up huge new tranches of US Treasury debt at high prices, belies the argument that the economy has too much debt.	但又有多少媒体报道稍稍考虑过这些观点是否成立？
	还有人认为，财政刺激措施虽然刺激了当下的就业和生产，但推升美国国债的作用过强，因此其长期代价过于庞大。
	此观点稍显高明，却也不够严密。
	如果美国国债利率原本就很高，而且随债务的膨胀而迅速攀升，我会赞同这种观点。
Those who claim that America has a debt problem, and that a debt problem cannot be cured with more debt, ignore (sometimes deliberately) that private debt and US Treasury debt have been very different animals – moving in different directions and behaving in different ways – since the start of the financial crisis.	但事实上，美国国债利率极低，而且并未上升。 美国财政部每次拍卖国债，市场都会以高价将其一扫而空，这一次又一次地批驳了认为美国负债过高的观点。
What the market is saying is not that the economy has too much debt, but that it has too much private debt, which is why prices of corporate bonds are low and firms find financing expensive. The market is also saying – clearly and repeatedly – that the economy has too little public US government debt, which is why everyone wants to hold it.	声称美国存在债务问题、而且增发债务不能解决此问题的人忽视（有时是有意忽视）了一个事实：私人债务和美国国债绝非同类，自本次金融危机爆发起，二者的走势和行为就大相径庭。
	
Why Are Governments Paralyzed?	为什么政府如此无能？
MILAN – It is no secret that the global economy is struggling.	米兰—全球经济步履蹒跚，这已经不是什么秘密了。
Europe is in the midst of a crisis whose root cause is a structurally flawed monetary and economic union.	欧洲正在危机中挣扎，这场危机的根源在于具有结构性缺陷的货币和经济联盟。
The United States, emerging slowly from a financial crisis and widespread deleveraging, is experiencing a growth slowdown, a persistent employment problem, an adverse shift in income distribution, and structural challenges, with little effective or decisive policy action.	美国正在从金融危机和大规模去杠杆化中慢慢恢复，仍在经历缓慢增长、持续失业、收入分配状况恶化以及结构性挑战，也没有拿出多少有效或坚决的政策动作。
Meanwhile, among the major emerging economies, China’s reform process is on hold, pending a leadership transition this fall that will clarify various internal interests’ goals and power relationships.	与此同时，在主要新兴经济体，中国的改革进程陷入了停顿，今年秋天的领导人交接将厘清不少内部利益目标和权力关系。
India, which has lost reform momentum, is experiencing an economic slowdown and a potential loss of investor confidence.	印度早已失去改革动力，现在正在经历经济放缓和投资者信心潜力丧失。
The negative effects of these problems are now interacting, feeding back on themselves, and spreading to the rest of the global economy.	这些问题的不利影响相互交织、相互强化，并传向整个全球经济。
And yet, despite a palpable sense of concern that something is very wrong, the prognosis for significant change is bleak – and deteriorating.	尽管人们显然已经知道一定有东西出了大问题，但对重大变化的预判却十分缺乏，而且都没有说到点子上。
What accounts for the apparent lack of effective policy action across a broad range of countries and regions?	为什么如此多的国家和地区都显然没有拿出有效的政策措施？
One line of thinking blames a “leadership vacuum” – a common diagnosis in Europe.	一种思路将矛头指向“领导真空 ” ， 这是对欧洲的普遍看法。
Elsewhere – especially in the US – polarization and ugly zero-sum politics are thought to discourage potentially capable political leadership.	在其他地区，特别是美国，分化和丑陋的零和政治被认为是阻止拥有潜在能力政治领袖上台的原因。
But, absent further analysis, the leadership vacuum becomes a catchall explanation.	但是，如果不进行进一步分析，领导真空无非是一种万能借口。
What we need to know is why new political leadership in democracies like France, Britain, Japan, and the US has produced so little change.	我们需要知道的是，为什么在法国、英国、日本和美国这样的民主国家，新政治领袖不能带来变革。
A second explanation addresses that question: While bold action is required, the complexity of economic conditions, and disagreement about the right policy responses, implies a risk of serious error.	第二个解释便是为了解决这个问题：尽管我们需要果断行动，但经济条件的复杂性以及在什么才是正确的政策应对这一问题上的分歧意味着出现重大失误的风险很高。
For professional politicians and policymakers in such circumstances, less may be more.	在这样的环境下，职业政客和决策者会觉得少即是多。
On this view, risk aversion both reflects and reinforces a divergence between individual incentives (the desire to be reelected, reappointed, or promoted) and collective needs (fixing problems).	如此看来，风险厌恶反映并强化了个人激励（连任、保位和升职的渴望）和集体需求（解决问题）之间的分歧。
A third answer is that policy instruments are simply ineffective in today’s conditions.	第三个答案是，在当今的环境下，政策工具根本起不了作用。
There is some merit to this claim.	这种说法不无道理。
Economic deleveraging takes time.	经济去杠杆化需要时间。
The restoration of sustainable patterns of growth requires years, not months.	重塑可持续增长模式需要多年，而不是几个月。
Expectations may be out of line with the underlying reality.	预期也许已经远远超越了现实基础。
But the absence of a quick solution does not mean that nothing can be done to improve the speed and quality of recovery.	但速效药的缺乏并不意味着在改善复苏速度和质量方面束手无策。
Vested interests may also play a role.	既得利益也在起作用。
Technological innovation and global market forces have produced a decisive shift in income toward capital and the upper 20% of the income distribution, often at the expense of middle-income groups, the unemployed, and the young.	技术进步和全球市场力量产生了决定性的变化：收入向资本和收入分配的前20%人群集中，而因此牺牲的通常是中产阶级、失业者和年轻人。
The beneficiaries of these trends may have accumulated enough political influence to maintain the status quo, highlighting distributional issues that have generally received too little attention in understanding policy responses or their absence.	这一趋势的受益者积累了足够的政治影响力来维持现状，凸显出在理解政策反应及其缺位的问题中受到太少关注的分配问题。
There are structural explanations for policy inaction as well.	在政策不作为方面也存在结构性解释。
Governance systems and constitutional structures differ in the extent to which they require broad consensus for official action, or to change policy direction in response to shocks or shifting conditions.	各地区治理制度和宪法结构各有不同，必须形成广泛一致才能产生正式行动或是随冲击和条件的变化改变政策方向。
Some argue that the more constraining political systems work well in stable times, but perform poorly under volatile conditions like those prevailing today.	有人指出，更具约束性的政治制度在稳定时期效果很好，但在如今这样的普遍波动时期效果会很差。
Others support constrained government on the grounds that it protects everyone from waste, rent-seeking, and interference with freedom of choice, and that, when needed, inspired leadership can build the required consensus to address changing circumstances.	也有人支持有约束的政府，他们的出发点是这能杜绝浪费、寻租和干预自由选择从而保护所有人，此外，必要时令人鼓舞的领导者可以造就必须的共识纠正变化的环境。
High hurdles to major shifts in policy direction force officials to make a convincing case.	在重大政策方向变化方面的巨大困难能迫使官员拿出令人信服的表现。
That is an inherently difficult task at a time when rapid change in the global economy has left many still trying to understand what is happening and what it all means for growth, stability, the distribution of income, and employment.	全球经济的快速变化让很多人一下子无法理解正在发生什么、这对增长、稳定、收入分配和就业意味着什么。 在这样的情况下，困难再自然不过了。
In the face of such complexity, it is not surprising that genuine policy disagreements lead to extended debate and relatively little action.	面对如此复杂性，毫不奇怪实实在在的政策分歧会导致没完没了的争论和相对极少的行动。
Moreover, the technocratic elements of government must often be balanced against democratic accountability.	此外，政府中的技术官僚元素必须时刻用民主可问责性来平衡。
In every society, individuals with special training and expertise are appointed to perform technically complex functions.	在每个国家都有受过专门训练、拥有专长的个人被任命对付在技术上颇为复杂的问题。
Their freedom of action is constrained by time limits and reappointment procedures that determine the nature and degree of their accountability to elected officials and the public.	他们采取行动的自由有时间界限和连任程序的约束，后两者决定了当选官员和公众是否及在多大程度上对他们可以问责。
There can be too little freedom of action (populism) or too little accountability (autocracy).	可能出现行动重重受限的局面（民粹主义 ） ， 也可能出现无法问责的情况（专制独裁 ） 。
The necessary balance may vary according to local conditions.	所需要的平衡可能因地方条件的不同而不同。
For example, many China observers believe that accountability there needs to increase at this stage of the country’s economic, social, and political evolution.	比如，许多中国观察者认为，从该国的经济、社会和政治演进阶段出发，可问责性需要加强。
Others argue that Western democracies have the opposite problem: a surfeit of narrow, politically assertive interests leads to underinvestment and poor tradeoffs between present and future opportunities and performance.	其他人则认为，西方民主存在相反的问题：狭隘、政治一根筋的利益太大，导致投资不足以及当前和未来机会和表现权衡失策。
This brings us to a crucial obstacle: Government, business, financial, and academic elites are not trusted.	这就引出了关键性障碍：政府、商界、金融界和学术精英不受信任。
Lack of trust in elites is probably healthy at some level, but numerous polls indicate that it is in rapid decline, which surely increases citizens’ reluctance to delegate authority to navigate an uncertain global economic environment.	对精英的信任缺失在某种程度上并非坏事，但大量民调显示，精英的信誉正在快速降低，而这显然增加了公民对授权给他们领导应对不确定的全球经济环境的抵制。
Loss of trust probably has multiple causes, including analytical failure: central banks, regulators, market participants, rating agencies, and economists almost all failed to detect rising systemic risk in the years preceding the current crisis, much less to take appropriate corrective action.	信任缺失的源头是多样的，其中就包括分析失灵：中央银行、监管者、市场参与者、评级机构和经济学家几乎全都没有在危机爆发前的几年中看到系统性风险的上升，更不用说采取适当的正确行动了。
But a more important cause is a suspicion that elites are placing their own interests above shared social values.	但更重要的源头在于人们怀疑精英将自己的利益置于社会共同价值之上。
Claims that our leadership, institutions, analyses, or policy instruments are inadequate to the task at hand surely contain a kernel of truth.	毫无疑问，宣称我们的领导曾、制度、分析和政策工具不足以应对当前任务触及了真相的核心。
But the deeper problem is a breakdown in precisely such values and goals – that is, a weakening of social cohesion.	但更深层次的问题是这些价值和目标的崩溃，即社会凝聚力的弱化。
Restoring it will require analysts, policymakers, business leaders, and civil-society groups to clarify causes, share blame for mistakes, pursue flexible solutions in which costs are shared equitably, and, most important, explain that hard problems cannot be solved overnight.	重塑社会凝聚力需要分析师、决策者、商界领袖和公民社会团体厘清原因、共担错误责任、追求成本被公平分担的灵活方案，最重要的是，必须澄清这一难题无法在一夜之间得到解决。
	
The Long Mystery of Low Interest Rates	低利率的长期秘密
CAMBRIDGE – As policymakers and investors continue to fret over the risks posed by today’s ultra-low global interest rates, academic economists continue to debate the underlying causes. By now, everyone accepts some version of US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke’s statement in 2005 that a “global savings glut” is at the root of the problem.	美国剑桥—决策者和投资者仍对当今极低的全球利率而不安，学界经济学家则仍在争论背后的原因。 目前，所有人都在某种程度上同意美联储主席伯南克2005年的讲话 ： “ 全球储蓄过剩”是问题的根源。
But economists disagree on why we have the glut, how long it will last, and, most fundamentally, on whether it is a good thing.	但经济学家就过剩的原因、过剩会持续多久以及更基本的，过剩是否事件好事等问题存在分歧。
Bernanke’s original speech emphasized several factors – some that decreased the demand for global savings, and some that increased supply.	伯南克的原始讲话强调了几个因素 — — 一些因素降低了全球储蓄需求，另一些因素增加了供给。
Either way, interest rates would have to fall in order for world bond markets to clear.	无论如何，利率必须降低，以使世界债券市场出清。
He pointed to how the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990’s caused the region’s voracious investment demand to collapse, while simultaneously inducing Asian governments to stockpile liquid assets as a hedge against another crisis.	他指出，20世纪90年代末的亚洲金融危机导致了该地区巨大的投资需求崩溃，同时导致亚洲各国纷纷囤积流动性资产作为下一场危机的对冲手段。
Bernanke also pointed to increased retirement saving by aging populations in Germany and Japan, as well as to saving by oil-exporting countries, with their rapidly growing populations and concerns about oil revenues in the long term.	伯南克还提到了德国和日本老龄人口退休储蓄的增加，以及人口快速增长、担心长期石油收入的石油出口国的储蓄。
Monetary policy, incidentally, did not feature prominently in Bernanke’s diagnosis.	而货币政策并非伯南克诊断书的主要内容。
Like most economists, he believes that if policymakers try to keep interest rates at artificially low levels for too long, eventually demand will soar and inflation will jump.	与大部分经济学家一样，他认为如果决策者试图将利率人为地压低太长时间，需求终将激增，通胀会快速抬头。
So, if inflation is low and stable, central banks cannot be blamed for low long-term rates.	因此，只要通胀维持在稳定低水平，央行就不必为低长期利率担责。
In fact, I strongly suspect that if one polled investors, monetary policy would be at the top of the list, not absent from it, as an explanation of low global long-term interest rates.	事实上，我强烈质疑，如果你对投资者做一番调查就会发现，货币政策赫然居于全球低长期利率原因清单的榜首而非无人提及。
The fact that so many investors hold this view ought to make one think twice before absolving monetary policy of all responsibility.	如此之多的投资者作如是观这一事实理应让人在为货币政策开脱之前三思。
Nevertheless, I share Bernanke’s instinct that, while central banks do set very short-term interest rates, they have virtually no influence over long-term real (inflation-adjusted) rates, other than a modest effect through portfolio management policies (for example, “quantitative easing”).	尽管如此，我仍同意伯南克的直觉，即央行确实决定着极短期利率，但它们对长期真实（经通胀调整）利率几无影响力，只能通过投资组合管理政策（比如“量化宽松 ” ） 略微施加影响。
A lot has changed since 2005.	2005年以来，世界改变了许多。
We had the financial crisis, and some of the factors cited by Bernanke have substantially reversed.	我们经历了金融危机，伯南克所提到的某些因素发生了彻底逆转。
For example, Asian investment is booming again, led by China.	比如，亚洲投资在中国的带领下再次井喷。
And yet global interest rates are even lower now than they were then.	但全球利率甚至比当年更低了。
Why?	这是为什么？
There are several competing theories, most of them quite elegant, but none of them entirely satisfactory.	解释这一现象的理论有很多，大多颇为漂亮，但没有一个彻底令人满意。
One view holds that long-term growth risks have been on the rise, raising the premium on assets that are perceived to be relatively safe, and raising precautionary saving in general.	一种观点是长期增长风险在上升，提高了被认为相对安全的资产的溢价，也提高了总体预防性储蓄。
(Of course, no one should think that any government bonds are completely safe, particularly from inflation and financial repression.)	（当然，政府债券���并非完全安全，特别是考虑到通胀和金融抑制的情况。
Certainly, the 2008 financial crisis should have been a wakeup call to proponents of the “Great Moderation” view that long-term volatility has fallen.	）毫无疑问，2008年金融危机不啻对“大稳健”观点（长期波动性下降）的警钟。
Many studies suggest that it is becoming more difficult than ever to anchor expectations about long-term growth trends.	许多研究表明，锚定长期增长趋势预期正变得前所未有地困难。
Witness, for example, the active debate about whether technological progress is accelerating or decelerating.	比如，关于技术进步在加速还是在减速的问题就存在激烈争论。
Shifting geopolitical power also breeds uncertainty.	地缘政治实力的变迁也在滋生不确定性。
Another class of academic theories follows Bernanke (and, even earlier, Michael Dooley, David Folkerts-Landau, and Peter Garber) in attributing low long-term interest rates to the growing importance of emerging economies, but with the major emphasis on private savings rather than public savings.	另一组学术理论支持伯南克（或为时更早的杜雷（Michael Dooley ） 、 福克尔茨-朗道（David Folkerts-Landau）和加珀（Peter Garber ） ） ，将低长期利率归因于新兴经济体重要性的增加，但他们更强调私人储蓄，而非公共储蓄。
Because emerging economies have relatively weak asset markets, their citizens seek safe haven in advanced-country government bonds.	新兴经济体的资产市场相对较弱，因此其国民转向发达国家政府债券寻找安全港。
A related theory is that emerging economies’ citizens find it difficult to diversify the huge risk inherent in their fast-growing but volatile environments, and feel particularly vulnerable as a result of weak social safety nets.	一个相关的理论是，新兴经济体的国民发现难以分散其快速增长但波动性高的环境所蕴含的巨大风险，社会安全网的不足尤其让他们感到脆弱。
So they save massively.	因此他们大量储蓄。
These explanations have some merit, but one should recognize that central banks and sovereign wealth funds, not private citizens, are the players most directly responsible for the big savings surpluses.	这些解释不无道理，但你得清楚，央行和主权财富基金，而不是私人国民，才是巨大储蓄盈余的最直接原因。
It is a strain to think that governments have the same motivations as private citizens.	认为政府和私人国民有着相同动机是一个局限。
Besides, on closer inspection, the emerging-market explanation, though convenient, is not quite as compelling as it might seem.	此外，更细致地观察就会发现，新兴市场解释尽管很方便，但并不像看起来那样令人信服。
Emerging economies are growing much faster than the advanced countries, which neoclassical growth models suggest should push global interest rates up, not down.	新兴经济体比发达国家增长更快，在新古典增长模型看来，这应该推高而不是压低全球利率。
Similarly, the integration of emerging-market countries into the global economy has brought with it a flood of labor.	同样，新兴市场国家融入全球经济给后者带来了巨大的劳动力。
According to standard trade theory, a global labor glut ought to imply an increased rate of return on capital, which again pushes interest rates up, not down.	根据标准贸易理论，全球劳动力过剩应该导致资本回报率上升，而这也会推高而不是压低利率。
Surely, any explanation must include the global constriction of credit, especially for small and medium-size businesses.	当然，不论怎样解释，都必须考虑全球信用压缩的事实，特别是中小企业信用。
Tighter regulation of lending standards has shut out an important source of global investment demand, putting downward pressure on interest rates.	收紧贷款标准监管关闭了一个重要的全球投资需求阀门，给利率造成了下行压力。
My best guess is that when global uncertainty fades and global growth picks up, global interest rates will start to rise, too.	我的猜想是，当全球不确定性消除，全球增长抬头时，全球利率也会开始上升。
But predicting the timing of this transition is difficult.	但预测这一变化何时到来十分困难。
The puzzle of the global savings glut may live on for several years to come.	全球储蓄过剩之谜或许还得在维持几年。
	
Why Are Savings Patterns So Different?	储蓄模式为何如此迥异?
BEIJING – Ever since the integration of emerging markets into the global economy began in the early 1990’s, three striking trends have emerged: a divergence in private savings rates between the industrialized core and the emerging periphery (the former experiencing a sharp rise, and the latter a steady decline); large global imbalances between the two regions; and a drop in interest rates worldwide.	发自北京 — — 自从新兴市场在1990年代初整合进全球经济以来出现了三大引人注目的趋势：核心发达工业国与外围新兴国家在个人储蓄率上的分化（前者大幅上升而后者稳步下降 ） ； 两个区域之间的巨额全球不平衡；以及全球各地的利率下调。
But, while global imbalances have preoccupied many observers, few have sought to explain the divergence in world savings behavior.	而当全球不平衡状况吸引了许多观察者的目光之时，只有很少人尝试去解释世界各地储蓄模式的分化。
In 1988, the household savings rate in China and the United States was roughly equal, at about 5%.	在1988年，中美两国的家庭储蓄率基本持平，大概在5%左右。
Yet, by 2007, China’s household savings rate had risen to a staggering 30%, compared to just 2.5% in the US.	但到了2007年，中国家庭的储蓄率已经上升到令人吃惊的30 % ， 而美国仅有2.5 % 。
The pattern is not uncharacteristic of other industrialized countries relative to emerging markets over the last two decades (Figure 1).	这个模式在过去20年间其他发达工业国与新兴市场的比较中是不具备典型性的（表一 ） 。
Savings behavior invariably reacts to changes in interest rates, which have fallen steadily over the last two decades to today’s record-low levels.	储蓄行为总是与利率的变化相对应，而后者在过去20年间持续走低到今时今日的破纪录水平。
But how can savings patterns be so different – often opposite – in globalized economies that are well integrated into world capital markets?	但在这些完全融入世界资本市场的全球化经济体之间为何会出现如此显著 — — 往往相反的 — — 储蓄模式差异呢？
The answer may be that credit markets are more developed in advanced economies than they are in emerging countries, particularly in terms of the degree to which households are able to borrow.	答案或许是发达国家的信贷市场比新兴国家发展得更为完善，尤其是在家庭可借贷数额的程度上。
Of course, one might argue that Asian thrift and American profligacy merely reflect asymmetric demands for credit: Asians are intrinsically more reluctant to borrow.	当然，有人会提出亚洲的节约和美国的挥霍仅仅是反映了对信贷的不对称需求：亚洲人骨子里更不愿意去借钱。
In that case, however, the vast differences in household debt (Figure 2) – ranging from 25% of GDP in emerging Asia (Southeast Asia, China, India, Hong Kong, and South Korea) to more than 90% in the US and other Anglo-Saxon economies (including Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom) – would reflect only a dissimilarity in taste.	照这样说来，家庭负债的显著差异（表二 ） — —从新兴亚洲国家（东南亚、中国、印度，香港和韩国）的25%到美国以及其他盅格鲁-撒克逊经济体（包括澳大利亚、加拿大、爱尔兰，新西兰和英国）的超过90 % — —就只是些偏好上的差异。
A more plausible explanation is that institutional differences in the ability to borrow dictate to some extent the disparity in savings rates across countries.	而另一个更能令人信服的解释就是在借贷能力上的制度差异在某种程度上决定着各国之间储蓄率的不一致性。
The argument is simple: All economies have both borrowers and savers, and changes in the cost of borrowing (or the return to saving) affect them differently.	理由很简单，所有经济体内部都有贷款者和存款者，而借款成本（或者储蓄回报）的变动会对他们造成不一样的影响。
When interest rates decline, borrowers are able to borrow more. Savers, on the other hand, may be compelled to save more in the face of shrinking interest income.	当利率走低时，贷款者就能贷更多的钱，相反存款者可能不得不在利息收入下降时储蓄更多。
At the macro level, a less credit-constrained economy (with a large mass of effective borrowers) could then experience a fall in the savings rate as borrowing rose.	在宏观层面，一个贷款限制较少（因此拥有大量有效贷款者）的经济体会在贷款增加时出现储蓄减少的情况。
However, in a country with a large mass of effective savers, the savings rate can rise, rather than fall.	然而一个拥有大量有效存款者的国家，存款率会不降反升。
This asymmetry in savings patterns might thus reflect the simple fact that credit-constrained economies are less sensitive to drops in the cost of borrowing relative to less constrained economies.	这种储蓄模式的不对称可能因此体现出一个简单的事实：限制贷款的经济体相对于较少限制贷款的经济体来说对贷款成本的下降更加不敏感。
In joint research with Nicolas Coeurdacier and Stéphane Guibaud, we show that economic data supports this view.	在笔者与尼古拉斯·科尔达西埃（Nicolas Coeurdacier）和史黛芬妮·居堡（ Stéphane Guibaud）的联合研究中，我们找到了经济数据来支持上述观点。
Borrowers and savers are naturally grouped by age.	贷款者和储蓄者通过年龄分组。
The young normally face low, current wage income, but faster growth in future income, and would ideally borrow against future income to augment consumption today and to invest in education.	年轻人通常拥有较低的当前工资收入，但在未来收入方面增长较快，并适合透支未来收入以扩大当前消费并在教育方面投资。
The middle-aged, preparing for retirement, are likely to be the economy’s savers.	而准备退休的中年人更可能是经济体中的储蓄者。
If asymmetric credit constraints are indeed important, young borrowers and middle-aged savers will display distinct patterns in constrained versus less-constrained economies.	如果信贷限制的不一致确实是重要因素的话，那么年轻贷款者和中年储蓄者就将在限制贷款和较少限制贷款经济体的比较中表现出截然不同的行为模式。
In fact, there was a remarkable contrast in savings behavior across age groups in China and the US in the period 1992-2009.	事实上，中美两国在1992至2009年间不同年龄段的储蓄行为之间存在着显著差异。
For young Americans (those under 25), the borrowing rate rose by ten percentage pointsmore than the borrowing rate of young Chinese, while the savings rate of the Chinese working-age population (ages 35-54) rose by about 17 percentage points more than the savings rate of their American counterparts.	年轻美国人（25岁以下）比年轻中国人的贷款率高出10 % ， 而参加工作后的中国人（35-54岁）在储蓄率方面比同龄的美国人高出17 % 。
Another implication of this view is that the steep rise in savings in China is largely driven by a rise in the savings rate of middle-aged Chinese (rather than a fall in the borrowing rate of the young).	这个观点的另一个含义就是中国储蓄的急剧上升在很大程度上是由中年中国人储蓄率的上升（而不是年轻人贷款率下降）所导致的。
Conversely, the fall in savings in the US is largely due to higher borrowing by the young (rather than a fall in middle-aged Americans’ savings rate).	相反，美国储蓄率的减少则主要来自于年轻人更多的贷款（而不是中年美国人储蓄率的下降 ） 。
Indeed, of the 20.2-percentage-point increase in aggregate household savings (as a share of GDP) in China from 1992 to 2009, the middle-aged cohort accounted for more than 60% (the remainder was largely attributable to the elderly).	事实上，在中国1992至2009年家庭总储蓄率（作为GDP的一部分）所增加的20.2%中，中年人群体占了超过60 % （ 余下部分主要由老年人贡献 ） 。
In the US, which experienced a 1.8-percentage-point decline in aggregate savings as a share of GDP, the savings-to-GDP ratio among the young declined by 1.25 percentage points, whereas the figure for middle-aged savers actually increased by about 1.5 percentage points.	在美国，在作为GDP一部分的总储蓄率下降的1.8%中，年轻群体中的储蓄/GDP比率下降了1.25 % ， 而中年储蓄者的数据实际上是上升了大约1.5 % 。
Apart from accounting for the global divergence in savings rates, tight credit constraints in China might explain the country’s high, and rising, savings rate – especially as the large rise in national savings is attributable mostly to household savings.	除了考虑在储蓄率方面的全球差异之外，中国的严格信贷限制可能有助于解释该国较高且不断增加的储蓄率 — — 尤其是巨额国家储蓄主要来自于家庭储蓄的情况下。
This would mean that China’s much-publicized effort to boost domestic consumption might in fact call for appropriate credit-market reforms.	这将意味着中国大肆宣扬的刺激国内消费计划可能需要呼唤适当的信贷市场改革。
US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke’s notion of a “global savings glut” is a commonly cited explanation for falling world interest rates.	美联储主席本·伯南克（Ben Bernanke）所提到的“全球储蓄过量”概念经常被用来解释世界各地利率下降的状况。
Credit constraints in fast-growing developing economies may be the reason why the glut emerged in the first place.	而高增长发展中国家的信贷限制可能就是为何过量首先会出现在这些地方的原因。
	
Europe’s Path to Disunity	欧洲的分裂之路
MUNICH – The motto of the United States of America is: “E pluribus unum” (Out of many, one).	慕尼黑—美国的座右铭：合众为一。
The European Union’s motto is “In varietate concordia,” which is officially translated as “United in diversity.”	欧盟的座右铭：多样统一。
It is difficult to express the differences between the US and the European model any more clearly than this.	用来解释美国和欧洲模式的区别，没有比这两句话更清楚的了。
The US is a melting pot, whereas Europe is a mosaic of different peoples and cultures that has developed over the course of its long history.	美国是一个熔炉，而欧洲是一张历史悠久的由不同民族和文化组成的马赛克。
That difference raises the question of whether it is worth striving for a United States of Europe – a concept that many refuse to accept, because they do not believe in the possibility of a unified European identity.	这一不同引出了一个问题：是否值得为欧罗巴合众国而奋斗。 许多人拒绝欧罗巴合众国这一概念，因为他们不相信欧洲有可能会产生同一的身份。
A single political system like that of the US, they insist, presupposes a common language and a single nationality.	他们坚持认为，像美国那样的单一政治体系需以共同语言和单一民族成分为条件。
Perhaps the idea of a United States of Europe, the dream of post-war children like me, can never be realized.	或许欧罗巴合众国这一我等战后一代欧洲人的梦想永远都不可能实现。
But I am not so sure.	但我也不能把话说死。
After all, deeper European integration and the creation of a single political system offer solid, practical advantages that do not require a common identity or language.	毕竟，更深层次的欧洲一体化和单一政治体系的建立能够提供必须要共同身份和语言的坚实而实际的进步。
These advantages include the right to move freely across borders, the free movement of goods and services, legal certainty for cross-border economic activities, Europe-wide transportation infrastructure, and, not least, common security arrangements.	这些进步包括自由跨国迁徙、自由商品和服务流、跨国经济活动的法律环境的确定性、泛欧洲交通基础设施以及共同防务安排。
Banking regulation is the most topical area in which collective action makes sense.	银行监管是有意义集体行动的最热门领域。
If banks are regulated at the national level, but do business internationally, national regulatory authorities have a permanent incentive to set lax standards to avoid driving business to other countries and to lure it from them instead.	如果银行在国家水平监管而从事国际业务，那么国家监管当局就永远有放松监管标准以防业务外流、吸引业务流入的激励。
Regulatory competition thus degenerates into a race to the bottom, since the benefits of lax regulation translate into profits at home, while the losses lie with bank creditors around the world.	于是，监管竞争就退化为争相放松的竞争，因为放松监管的好处是将利润留在国内，而损失则由全世界银行债权人承担。
There are many similar examples from the fields of standards, competition policy, and taxation that are applicable here.	在监管标准、竞争政策和税收政策等方面，有许多相似的例子。
So, fundamental considerations speak for deeper European integration, extending even to the creation of a single European state.	因此，更深层次的欧洲一体化 — — 甚至到建立单一欧洲国家的程度 — — 需要基础性的考虑。
The danger of following such a path always lies in the fact that collective decision-making bodies not only provide services that are useful to everybody, but also may abuse their power to redistribute resources among the participating countries.	这条路存在永远的风险：集体决策机构不但提供对所有人都有用的服务，也会滥用手里的权力，在参与国之间重新分配资源。
Even democratic bodies are not immune to this danger.	即使民主也不能对这一风险免疫。
On the contrary, they make it possible for majorities to exploit minorities.	相反，民主可能会导致多数人掠夺少数人。
To counter this threat, democratic bodies invariably need special rules to protect minorities, such as the requirement of qualified majority voting or unanimous decision-making.	为了解决这一威胁，民主免不了需要特殊的规则保护少数人，如条件多数表决或一致意见决策。
The decisions taken by the European Central Bank are a particularly dramatic example of this problem, taken as they are by a simple majority of a body that is not even democratically elected.	欧洲央行的决策是这一问题的生动写照，这是一个简单多数胜出的机构，甚至都不是通过选举而产生的。
The ECB’s decisions lead to a massive redistribution of wealth and risk among the eurozone’s member states, as well as from stable countries’ taxpayers, who have little stake in the crisis, to global investors directly affected by it.	欧洲央行的决策导致了欧元区成员国之间大规模的财富和风险重新分配，慷稳定国纳税人之慨（他们与危机无甚关系 ） ， 救直接受危机影响的全球投资者。
The ECB has been providing virtually all of its refinancing credit to the eurozone’s five crisis-stricken countries: Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, and Ireland.	欧洲央行几乎将所有再融资信用都给了欧元区五大危机国：意大利、西班牙、葡萄牙、希腊和爱尔兰。
All the money circulating in the eurozone originated in these five countries and was then largely used to buy goods and assets in the northern member countries and redeem foreign debt taken from them.	流通于欧元区的所有资金都产生于这五个国家，并随后大部分用于购买北欧成员国商品和资产以及偿还外国债务。
The US Federal Reserve would never be allowed to conduct such a regionally imbalanced policy.	美联储永远不可能允许实施如此地区不平衡的政策。
The Fed cannot even provide credit to specific regions, let alone states on the verge of bankruptcy (for example, California).	美联储甚至不能为具体的地区提供信用，更不用说向处于破产边缘的州（如加州）注资了。
And now European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, backed by most of the troubled eurozone countries, is again proposing Eurobonds and debt-mutualization schemes.	而如今，欧洲委员会主席范龙佩在大部分受困欧元区国家的支持下，再次提议欧元债券和债务共同化机制。
These ideas go well beyond the American system.	这些方案已经超过了美国政策的边界。
The kind of fiscal integration and centralized power that they would require do not even remotely resemble those in place in the US.	财政一体化及其所要求的权力集中和美国的情形毫无相似之处。
Van Rompuy’s proposals are extremely dangerous and could destroy Europe.	范龙佩的方案是极其危险的，可能会毁掉欧洲。
The path toward a union based on joint liabilities, against the wishes of large parts of its population, is not leading to a federal state in the true sense of the term – that is, to an alliance of equals, who freely decide to unite and promise to protect each other.	走向基于共同债务的联盟之路违背了欧洲大部分人民的意愿，是不可能通往真正意义上的联邦国家的，即无法产生平等的联盟，各成员国自由决定是否联合并承诺互相保护。
Nor can this path lead to a United States of Europe, simply because a large part of Europe refuses to follow it.	这条道路也不可能通往欧罗巴合众国，因为很大一部分欧洲国家拒绝如此。
Europe is not identical with the eurozone.	欧洲并不等同于欧元区。
It contains many more countries than those that use the euro.	它还包括很多不使用欧元的国家。
As useful as the euro could be for Europe’s prosperity if its obvious flaws were corrected, the way that the eurozone is now developing will split the EU and undermine the idea of unity in diversity.	修正了显而易见的缺陷后，欧元将对欧洲的繁荣有大助益，但与此同时，欧元区现在的发展方向是分裂欧盟，破坏多样统一的前景。
The assertion that the eurozone could be transformed into a United States of Europe is no longer convincing.	欧元区可以转化为欧罗巴合众国的设想已不再令人信服。
The path toward joint liability is far more likely to lead to a deep rift within Europe, because turning the eurozone into a transfer and debt union that can prevent the insolvency of any of its members would require more central power than currently exists in the US.	走向共同债务更有可能导致欧洲内部的分裂，因为将欧元区转变为转移和债务联盟从而防止任何成员国出现无力偿债的情形要求很大中央权力，远超美国当前存在的程度。
	
Austerity and Demoralization	紧缩和士气低落
NEW HAVEN – The high unemployment that we have today in Europe, the United States, and elsewhere is a tragedy, not just because of the aggregate output loss that it entails, but also because of the personal and emotional cost to the unemployed of not being a part of working society.	纽黑文—如今在欧洲、美国和其他地区出现的高失业是一场悲剧，不仅是因为这意味着总产出损失，也因为不再成为工作社会的一部分给失业者带来的个人和心理成本。
Austerity, according to some of its promoters, is supposed to improve morale.	用某些支持者的话说，紧缩是为了增进士气。
British Prime Minister David Cameron, an austerity advocate, says he believes that his program reduces “welfare dependency,” restores “rigor,” and encourages the “the doers, the creators, the life-affirmers.”	英国首相卡梅伦是紧缩支持者之一，他说他认为他的方案减少了“财富依赖 ” ， 重塑了“刻苦 ” ， 鼓励了“实干者、创作者和生活肯定者 ” 。
Likewise, US Congressman Paul Ryan says that his program is part of a plan to promote “creativity and entrepreneurial spirit.”	类似地，美国众议员保罗·莱恩说他的方案是刺激“创新力和企业家精神”的计划的一部分。
Some kinds of austerity programs may indeed boost morale.	某些类型的紧缩计划也许确实增进了士气。
Monks find their life’s meaning in a most austere environment, and military boot camps are thought to build character.	僧人在极端简朴的环境中寻求生命意义，军训也被视为塑造性格的良方。
But the kind of fiscal austerity that is being practiced now has the immediate effect of rendering people jobless and filling their lives with nothing but a sense of rejection and exclusion.	但现在所实施的财政紧缩有一个马上产生的效果 — — 让人们失业，导致他们只能用被拒绝和被排斥的感觉填充他们的生活。
One could imagine that a spell of unemployment might be a time of reflection, reestablishment of personal connections, and getting back to fundamental values.	你可以想象，一段时间的失业或许可以用来反思、重建个人人际网络和回归基本价值。
Some economists even thought long ago that we would be enjoying much more leisure by this point.	很久以前，一些经济学家甚至认为我们可以因此享受更多的闲暇。
John Maynard Keynes, in his 1930 essay “Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren,” speculated that, within a hundred years, that is, by 2030, higher incomes would reduce the average workday to a mere three hours, for a total workweek of only 15 hours.	凯恩斯在其1930年的论文《我们孙辈的经济可能 》 （ “Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren ” ） 中猜测，不出100年，也就是说，到2030年，更高的收入将把平均工作日时长缩减至三小时，工作周时长缩减至15小时。
While there are still 17 years to go, it appears that Keynes was way off the mark.	距离2030年还有17年，但凯恩斯的话看来是无法实现了。
So was Robert Theobald, who, in his 1963 book Free Men and Free Markets questioned the public’s repugnance toward high unemployment.	提奥巴德（Robert Theobald）的预测亦然 — — 在其1963年的著作《自由的人和自由市场 》 （ Free Men and Free Markets ） ， 他质疑了公众对高失业的厌恶之情。
He asserted that “we can have meaningful leisure rather than destructive unemployment,” and that we do not need “a whirling-dervish economy dependent on compulsive consumption.”	他认为“我们可以获得有意义的闲暇，而不是破坏性的失业 ” ， 并且我们不需要“依赖强制性消费的漩涡性的经济 ” 。
But finding something satisfying to do with our time seems inevitably to entail doing some sort of work: “meaningful leisure” wears thin after a while.	找到能让我们满意地消耗时间的途径免不了包括做些工作 ： “ 有意义的闲暇”不消多久便消散了。
People seem to want to work more than three hours a day, even if it is assembly-line work.	人们似乎渴望每天超过三小时的工作时间，即便它是流水线上的工作。
And the opportunity to work should be a basic freedom.	而工作机会也应该是基本自由之一。
Unemployment is a product of capitalism: people who are no longer needed are simply made redundant.	失业是资本主义的产物：不再需要你，你就是多余的。
On the traditional family farm, there was no unemployment.	在传统家庭农庄中不存在失业。
Austerity exposes the modern economy’s lack of interpersonal connectedness and the morale costs that this implies.	紧缩暴露了现代社会人际网络的缺乏及其隐含的士气成本。
Work-sharing might keep more people marginally attached to their jobs in an economic slump, thereby preserving their self-esteem.	工作分担使得更多的人在经济衰退期间部分地保住工作，从而保留了他们的自尊。
Instead of laying off 25% of its workforce in a recession, a company could temporarily reduce workers’ hours from, say, eight per day to six.	公司可以不在衰退期间裁掉25%的员工，而是临时性地削减工时，比如从每天八小时削减至六小时。
Everyone would remain employed, and all would come a little closer to Keynes’s ideal.	每个人都能保住工作，所有人都会向着凯恩斯的理想迈进一步。
Some countries, notably Germany, have encouraged this approach.	一些国家（最令人注目的是德国）鼓励这种做法。
But work-sharing raises technical problems if increased suddenly to deal with an economic crisis like the one we are now experiencing.	但工作分担产生了技术问题，如果其力度被突然加大以应对我们目前所经历的这种级别的经济危机的话。
These problems preclude the sudden movement toward the ideal of greater leisure that thinkers like Keynes and Theobald proclaimed.	这些问题阻止人们可以一下子进入凯恩斯和提奥巴德等思想家所认为的更多闲暇的理想状态。
One problem is that workers have fixed costs, such as transportation to work or a health plan, that do not decline when hours (and thus pay) are cut.	一个问题是工人有不因工作时长（从而薪酬）削减而减少的固定成本，比如通勤成本和医疗成本。
Their debts and obligations are similarly fixed.	他们的债务和义务也有类似的固定性。
They could have bought a smaller house had they known that their hours would be reduced, but now it is difficult to downsize the one that they did buy.	如果他们知道工时可能被削减，当初就会买更小的房子，但现在要减少已经购买的规模十分困难。
Another problem is that it may be difficult to reduce everyone’s job by the same amount, because some jobs scale up and down with production, while others do not.	另一个问题是可能很难以同等程度减少每个人的工时，因为一些岗位与产量呈正比关系，一些则否。
In his book Why Wages Don’t Fall During a Recession, Truman Bewley of Yale University reported on an extensive set of interviews with business managers involved with wage-setting and layoffs.	在其著作《为什么工资不会在衰退中降低 》 （ Why Wages Don’t Fall During a Recession）中，耶鲁大学的勃利（Truman Bewley）报告了大量对负责工资设定和裁员的企业经理的采访。
He found that they believed that a serious morale problem would result from reducing everyone’s hours and pay during a recession.	他发现他们认为在衰退中减少每个人的工时和工资会带来严重的士气问题。
Then all employees would begin to feel as if they did not have a real job.	随后所有雇员都会觉得他们没有真正的工作岗位似的。
In his interviews with managers, he was told that it is best (at least from a manager’s point of view) if the pain of reduced employment is concentrated on a few people, whose grumbling is not heard by the remaining employees.	在对经理的采访中，他得知最好的办法（至少用经理的眼光看是如此）是把裁员的痛苦集中到少数人身上，不让其他雇员听到他们的抱怨。
Employers worry about workplace morale, not about the morale of the employees they lay off.	雇主担心工作士气，而不关心被裁雇员的士气。
Their damaged morale certainly affects others as a sort of externality, which matters very much; but it does not matter to the firm that has laid them off.	他们的士气低落显然会影响到其他人，此乃外部性，所涉体大；但只要企业把他们裁掉，便万事大吉。
We could perhaps all be happy working fewer hours if the decline reflected gradual social progress.	或许人人都会对更少地工作感到愉快，如果工作时长减少反映社会逐渐进步的话。
But we are not happy with unemployment that results from a sudden fiscal crisis.	但我们不会对因突发财政危机导致的失业感到愉快。
That is why sudden austerity cannot be a morale builder.	这就是突然紧缩不可能成为士气驱动力的原因。
For morale, we need a social compact that finds a purpose for everyone, a way to show oneself to be part of society by being a worker of some sort.	比如，我们需要一份社会契约为每一个人找到一个目标、一条通过身为工人或类似的办法证明自己是社会一部分的道路。
And for that we need fiscal stimulus – ideally, the debt-friendly stimulus that raises taxes and expenditures equally.	因此我们需要财政刺激 — — 理想状况是同步提高税收和支出的债务友好型财政刺激。
The increased tax burden for all who are employed is analogous to the reduced hours in work-sharing.	所有有工作者增加的债务负担便是工作分担所减少的工作时长。
But, if tax increases are not politically expedient, policymakers should proceed with old-fashioned deficit spending.	但是，如果增税并非政治权宜之计，决策者就应该求助老式预算支出法。
The important thing is to achieve any fiscal stimulus that boosts job creation and puts the unemployed back to work.	重要的是要实现提振就业创造、让失业者回到工作中来的财政刺激，不管什么形式。
	
End Austerity Now	马上结束紧缩
EDINBURGH – In recent weeks, talk about a budding recovery in the eurozone has gained traction, with key indices pointing to expansion in the core countries – data that many are citing as evidence that austerity is finally working.	爱丁堡—最近几周，关于欧元区复苏萌芽的讨论声音建起，关键指标表明核心国已步入扩张 — — 很多人将这些数据作为紧缩最终奏效的证据。
Money-market funds from the United States are returning, albeit cautiously, to resume funding of European bank debt.	来自美国的货币市场基金又开始为欧洲银行债务提供资金了，尽管动作极为谨慎。
Even Goldman Sachs is now bullishly piling into European equities.	就连高盛目前也看好欧洲股市。
But is a recovery really underway?	但复苏真的已经开始了吗？
Cynics recall that a European recovery was supposed to take hold as early as the fourth quarter of 2010, and that every International Monetary Fund projection since then has predicted recovery “by the end of the year.”	怀疑派还记得，关于欧洲复苏的预期早在2010年第四季度就已经出现，自此以后，IMF次次都会预测“年底”复苏。
Instead, GDP has collapsed, with the Spanish and Italian economies expected to contract by close to 2% this year.	但是，GDP出现了崩溃，西班牙和意大利经济今年预计将收缩2 % 。
Portugal’s economy is set to shrink by more than 2%, and Greece’s output will fall by more than 4%.	葡萄牙经济将收缩超过2 % ， 希腊产出可能下降4 % 。
Moreover, unemployment in the eurozone has skyrocketed to an average rate of roughly 12%, with more than 50% youth unemployment in the periphery countries implying a long-term loss of talent and erosion of the tax base.	此外，欧元区失业率水平达到了惊人的程度，平均为12%左右，外围国年轻人失业率更是超过了50 % ， 这意味着人才的长期损失和税基的侵蚀。
And, despite the spike in unemployment, productivity growth in the eurozone is decidedly negative.	而尽管欧元区失业率居高不下，生产率水平却稳稳地处于负区间。
More significant, over the last year, the public debt/GDP ratio rose by seven percentage points in Italy, 11 in Ireland, and 15 in Portugal and Spain.	更重要的是，去年一年，公债/GDP比率在意大利上升了七个百分点，在爱尔兰上升了11个百分点，在葡萄牙和西班牙上升了15个百分点。
If the sine qua non of recovery via austerity is the stabilization and reduction of debt, the cynics’ case appears to have been made.	如果通过紧缩实现复苏的必要条件是债务水平的稳定和下降，那么怀疑派显然握有强大的证据。
Against this background, the return of US investors to provide short-term dollar funding for European bank debt smacks of a desperate hunt for yield that relies on European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro.	与此相对的是，美国投资者的归来为欧洲银行债务提供了短期美元资金，他们背靠欧洲央行行长德拉吉“竭尽全力”拯救欧元的承诺，疯狂地追逐收益率。
As for Goldman’s equity play, as bond-market guru Bill Blain put it, “the words ‘buy cheap, sell a bit dearer on the up, and then dump and run’ spring to mind.”	债券市场大亨布莱恩（Bill Blain）这样评论高盛的股票买入行为 ： “ 脑海中突然浮现出‘买在地位，稍稍上涨后卖掉，出货完毕逃之夭夭。 ’这句话 。 ”
In fact, any talk of recovery is premature until the losses incurred by austerity are recouped.	事实上，除非由紧缩引起的损失得到弥补，否则就无从谈论复苏。
As it stands, every country that has implemented an austerity program without imposing losses on private creditors has more debt now than when it started.	任何实施了紧缩计划但又没有强迫私人债权人承担损失的国家，其债务水平都比开始时高。
For example, according to official estimates, Spain’s public debt, which amounted to only about 36% of GDP when the crisis began, has almost tripled – and the actual figure may be much higher.	比如，根据官方统计数据，西班牙公债水平在危机肇始时只占GDP的36%左右，目前增加了近两倍，实际数字可能比这大得多。
More telling, the countries that cut expenditure the most experienced the largest bond-yield spikes and the most significant debt growth.	更具说明性是，削减支出最多的国家经历了最大幅度的债券收益率升高和最显著的债务增长。
The explanation for this is simple.	为什么会这样？ 原因很简单。
When a country gives up its monetary sovereignty, its banks are effectively borrowing in a foreign currency, making them exceptionally vulnerable to liquidity shocks, like that which sparked turmoil in Europe’s banking system in 2010-2011.	当一国放弃其货币主权时，其银行实际上用外币借款，这让它们极易受到流动性冲击，比如2010—2011年引起欧洲银行系统大动荡的那种。
The government, unable to print money to bail out the banks or increase export competitiveness through currency devaluation, is left with only two options: default or deflation (austerity).	政府无法印钱援助银行或通过货币贬值增加出口竞争力，于是只有两个选择：违约或通缩（紧缩 ） 。
Austerity’s underlying logic is that budget cuts, by reducing the debt burden and restoring confidence, ultimately enhance stability and support growth.	紧缩的基本逻辑是，削减赤字通过降低债务负担和重塑信心最终能够增强稳定、支持增长。
But, when countries pursue austerity simultaneously with their main trading partners, overall demand plummets, causing all of their economies to contract and, in turn, increasing their debt/GDP ratios.	但是，当一国与其主要贸易伙伴一起追求紧缩时，总需求会下降，导致所有它们的经济全都收缩，而这反过来提高了债务/GDP比率。
But the problem with austerity in the eurozone is more fundamental: policymakers are attempting to address a sovereign-debt crisis, though the real problem is a banking crisis.	但欧元区紧缩的问题更加基础：决策者在试图解决主权债务危机，尽管真正的原因是银行危机。
With Europe’s banking system triple the size and twice as leveraged as its US counterpart, and the ECB lacking genuine lender-of-last-resort authority, the sudden halt in capital flows to peripheral countries in 2009 created a liquidity-starved system that was too big to bail out.	欧洲银行系统规模是美国的三倍，杠杆是美国的两倍，欧洲央行也没有真正意义上的最后贷款人权力，因此2009年外围国家的资本突然断流导就造成了一个太大而救不了的流动性枯竭的系统。
As holders of euro-denominated assets recognized this situation, they turned to the ECB for insurance (which the ECB could not deliver under its previous president, Jean-Claude Trichet, whose leadership was defined by his commitment to maintaining price stability).	欧元计价资产持有者意识到了这���状况，他们转而要求欧洲央行做出担保（在前任央行特里谢治下，欧洲央行无法做出担保，因为特里谢的领导权来自他对维持价格稳定的承诺。
Investors’ subsequent efforts to price in the risk of a eurozone breakup – not the volume of sovereign debt – caused bond yields to spike.	）投资者随后开始考虑欧元区崩溃 — — 而不是主权债务量 — — 的风险，这导致债券收益率飙升。
But the financial-market turmoil fueled a panic among eurozone leaders, leading them to misdiagnose the malady and prescribe the wrong medicine, which has served only to generate new symptoms.	但金融市场动荡催生了欧元区领导人之间的恐慌，导致他们错判了病根，开错了药方，结果是造成了新的病症。
While Draghi’s promise, embodied by the ECB’s “outright monetary transactions” program – as well as its long-term refinancing operation and emergency liquidity assistance program – has bought time and lowered yields, the eurozone’s banking crisis persists.	尽管德拉吉所承诺的欧洲央行“直接货币交易”计划 — — 及其长期再融资操作和紧急流动性援助计划 — — 买来了时间和收益率的降低，但欧元区银行危机仍然没有消除。
Eurozone leaders must recognize that spending cuts will do nothing to stabilize the balance sheets of core-country banks that are over-exposed to peripheral countries’ sovereign debt.	欧元区领导人必须认识到，支出削减对稳定核心国银行资产负债表无济于事 — — 它们在外围国主权债务上的敞口太大。
Until Europe rejects austerity in favor of a growth-oriented approach, all signs of recovery will prove illusory.	除非欧洲为了增长导向方针拒绝紧缩，否则所有复苏迹象都将是一场梦。
	
Erdoğan’s Authoritarian Quackery	埃尔多安的极权主义骗术
TBILISI – Why do conspiracy theories and general charlatanism so often receive their strongest support from the world’s dictators?	第比利斯—为什么阴谋论和平庸骗术总是能够得到全世界独裁者的拥护？
Sure, dictators are almost always oddballs themselves, but that cannot be all there is to it.	诚然，独裁者几乎都是怪人，但这肯定不是全部原因。
In fact, it is worth asking whether quackery is a necessary feature of authoritarian rule.	事实上，应该问一问，骗术到底是不是独裁统治的必备特色。
The latest evidence that it is can be found at the heart of Turkey’s current economic crisis.	最新的证据可见于土耳其最近的经济危机的核心。
Turkey is saddled with debt and its currency, the lira, is plunging, yet the central bank has been all but prohibited from defending the currency by raising interest rates, because Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan believes that raising interest rates actually causes inflation.	土耳其不堪债务重负，其货币里拉正在崩盘中，但中央银行却被禁止用升息来捍卫货币可因为土耳其总统埃尔多安认为提高利率真会导致通胀。
The economics profession would beg to differ.	经济学界可不敢苟同。
But Erdoğan, as with much else, is not inclined to listen.	但埃尔多安 — — 和他在其他许多事情上 一样 — — 根本就不想听。
On the contrary, to force the central bank to pursue his bizarre monetary policy, Erdoğan has installed his utterly unqualified son-in-law, Berat Albayrak, as the country’s Minister of Finance and Treasury.	相反，为了迫使央行采取他的匪夷所思的货币政策，埃尔多安安排他远远不够格的女婿比拉特·艾尔贝拉克（Berat Albayrak）担任土耳其金融和财政部长。
Having grown up in the Soviet Union, I am particularly sensitive to the impact of perverse scientific theories on a society.	我在苏联长大，对于反科学理论对社会的影响非常敏感。
Joseph Stalin rejected Mendelian genetics (the fundamental laws of heredity) and even Darwin’s theory of evolution in favor of the bogus theories of Trofim Lysenko, the Soviet biologist who believed that human traits were acquired, not inherited.	斯大林拒绝接受孟德尔遗传学（遗传的基本定律）甚至达尔文的进化论，而支持苏联生物学家李森科（Trofim Lysenko）的伪科学。 李森科认为人类特征是获得而非遗传的。
With Stalin’s backing, Lysenko – whose spurious agricultural research doomed perhaps millions of people to starvation – sent Soviet biology down a two-decade-long rabbit hole of lunacy.	在斯大林的支持下，李森科 — — 其伪农业研究导致了数百万人挨饿 — — 让苏联生物学陷入了长达二十年的“失心疯 ” 。
Nikita Khrushchev may have overturned Stalinism, but he was no less a prisoner of theoretical perversity.	赫鲁晓夫也许对斯大林主义做了拨乱反正，但他同样也是理论任性的俘虏。
He not only supported the Lysenko theories, but also believed ideologically hardened engineers and geologists who insisted that the rules of communism could defy the laws of nature.	他不仅支持李森科的理论，还相信出于顽固的意识形态而坚持共产主义统治能够克服自然定律的工程师和地质学家。
They told him that Soviet atomic bombs could be used to reverse the course of major rivers, allowing water to be redirected toward agriculture, rather than being “wasted” by flowing into the Arctic Sea.	他们告诉他，苏联可以用原子弹来改变大河的流向，引导水流向农业，而不是流入北冰洋“浪费”掉。
Russia’s experience with lethal authoritarian charlatanism is hardly unique.	俄罗斯的致命极权主义昏招经验绝非独此一家。
Hitler’s embrace of demented racial “science” delivered the world into darkness and led, almost inexorably, to the Holocaust.	希特勒坚信胡说八道的种族“科学 ” ， 让世界陷入黑暗并导致了几乎不可挽回的大屠杀。
The perversion of reason was so normalized under Nazi rule that Josef Mengele’s grotesque human experiments could be discussed at scientific conferences just like any other medical research.	拒绝理性成为纳粹统治下的常规，以至于门格勒（Josef Mengele）的各种奇怪的人体实验也可以像医学研究那样拿到科学会议上讨论。
The same paranoia-fueled attraction to bogus science often motivates authoritarians to endorse conspiracy theories.	同样的因为偏执而被伪科学所吸引的情况，常常导致集权主义者接受阴谋论。
Erdoğan, who has long been convinced that external forces are relentlessly plotting against his regime, is no exception.	埃尔多安也不例外，他一直相信，外部势力在不懈地破坏他的政权。
In Erdoğan’s eyes, these malevolent forces usually act through the financial markets.	在埃尔多安眼中，这些恶毒势力常常通过金融市场采取行动。
So far, he has refrained from claiming outright that these markets act at the behest of “world Jewry” (the architects, many Turkish Islamists believe, of the 1908 Young Turk revolution and the secular republic that arose after World War I).	目前，他尚能忍住没有赤裸裸地宣称这些市场唯“世界犹太人”的马首是瞻（许多土耳其伊斯兰教徒认为，世界犹太人策划了1908年土耳其青年革命和一战后世俗共和国的崛起 ） 。
But his core supporters hear the dog whistle behind his condemnations of the forces of finance – forces that now seem to be demanding higher interest rates.	但他的核心支持者听到了隐藏在他对金融力量 — — 即现在要求升息的力量的谴责背后的“狗哨 ” 。
But perhaps no current leader is more susceptible to misbegotten science and half-baked conspiracy theories than the US president and wannabe authoritarian, Donald Trump.	但要论容易受野路子科学和半吊子阴谋论影响的现任领导人，非美国总统、渴望极权的特朗普莫属。
It should never be forgotten that Trump wormed his way into US politics by promoting the racist “birther” argument, which claimed that then-President Barack Obama was not born in the US and therefore did not qualify for the office he held.	永远不能忘记，特朗普的政坛之路起步于散播种族主义“出身论”观点，说时任总统奥巴马并非出生在美国，因此没有资格竞选总统。
Since entering the White House, the lunacy has only grown.	自特朗普入主白宫以来，他的失心疯变本加厉。
On more than 20 occasions, Trump has tweeted about a potential link between vaccines and autism.	他不下20次发表推特说疫苗与孤独症有关。
That link – first promoted by a disgraced British doctor and a former Playboy playmate – has been conclusively refuted by the scientific community.	这一联系 — — 最早由一位声名狼藉的英国医生和一位前《花花公子》封面女郎提出 — — 已经被科学界决定性地予以反驳。
Trump also denies any link between human activity and climate change, again bucking the overwhelming scientific consensus.	特朗普还否认人类活动与气候变化有任何关联，这也有悖于压倒性科学共识。
And he insists, over the protests of countless economists, that trade deficits are a sign of US economic weakness.	此外，他不顾无数经济学家的反对，认定贸易赤字是美国经济弱势的象征。
According to Alan Levinovitz, a professor of religious studies at James Madison University, Trump uses capitalization in his tweets much as medical quacks and religious charlatans did in their efforts to bamboozle the public in centuries past.	据詹姆斯·麦迪逊大学宗教研究教授艾伦·莱文诺维茨（Alan Levinovitz）看来，特朗普在推特中使用大写的次数堪与过去几百年中坑蒙拐骗普罗大众的“老军医”和神棍相比。
It is by no means clear whether Trump himself knows the difference between real and fake.	特朗普本人是否清楚真和假的区别无从而知。
He appears convinced that the FBI and the media are conspiring to bring down his presidency.	他似乎认为，联邦调查局和媒体在串通谋划让他下台。
In this sense, Trump has taken what the historian Richard Hofstadter described as the “paranoid style” from the fringes of US politics into the mainstream.	出于这一感觉，特朗普将历史学家理查德·霍夫斯塔特（Richard Hofstadter）所描述的“偏执逛风格”从美国政坛的边缘带到了主流。
Perhaps a shared paranoid style is what draws Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has continually argued that the world is conspiring to deprive Russia of the great-power status it deserves.	也许特朗普和普京都是偏执狂型，普京一直说世界阴谋剥夺俄罗斯赢得的超级大国地位。
In any case, as Turkey’s crisis starkly demonstrates, even the most deeply held of misbegotten beliefs eventually run up against reality.	无论如何，土耳其危机尖锐地表明，即使是最根深蒂固的伪信念，最终也要遇到现实。
“The world is what it is,” as the late V.S. Naipaul put it at the start of his novel A Bend in the River. “Those who are nothing, or allow themselves to become nothing, have no place in it.”	“世界就在那里 ， ” 已故的奈保尔在他的小说《大河湾 》 （ A Bend in the River）的开头写道 ， “ 一文不名者，或放任自己变得一文不名者，在那里没有位置 。 ”
The same could be said of authoritarian leaders.	极权主义领导人也是如此。
Those who refuse to recognize the world as it is – whether they are viewing it from Turkey, the US, Venezuela, or a host of other countries – eventually lose the position that their denial of reality was supposed to protect.	拒绝承认世界的真实面貌者 — — 不管他们从土耳其、美国、委内瑞拉还是从其他某个国家看待世界 — — 最终都会失去依靠否认现实来保护的地位。
	
Why Bannon Had to Go	为何班农必须走人
WASHINGTON, DC – In many, if not most, US administrations, some figure emerges who convinces the press that the president couldn’t function without him (it’s yet to be a her).	发自华盛顿特区 — — 在许多（如果不是大多数）美国政府机构中，总会不时有些人物冒起并让新闻界确信，如果没有他（目前还没有“她 ” ） 总统就没法干活了。
The indispensable aide is, indeed, one of the most well-worn tropes of the modern presidency.	事实上，一位不可或缺的助手是当代总统制最为常见的比喻之一。
Karl Rove was “Bush’s Brain”; Harry Hopkins held Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s prolific White House team together; Bill Moyers appeared on a magazine cover as “Johnson’s Good Angel.”	卡尔·罗夫（Karl Rove）是“布什的大脑 ” ； 哈里·霍普金斯（Harry Hopkins）帮助富兰克林·德拉诺·罗斯福（Franklin Delano Roosevelt）打点其规模庞大的白宫团队；比尔·莫耶斯（Bill Moyers）在杂志封面上的称号是“约翰逊总统的天使 ” 。
Without such a figure, the story inevitably goes, the administration would be a mess, if not a disaster.	倘若缺少了这样一位人物，这个故事就会不出意料地出问题，政府也会变得一团糟（如果算不上一场灾难的话 ） 。
As often as not, the trope is invented or encouraged by the particular indispensable figure.	通常，这一比喻是由那个特定的不可或缺的人物发明或鼓励的。
Journalists usually fall for the story, regardless of how well-founded it is: it clarifies everything, and it gives them something to write about.	对于记者来说，寻找一个好故事最重要，而这故事是否有切实的依据则不在考虑之列：这个人物会对一切问题予以澄清，也给新闻界一些爆料去写在文章里。
The indispensable aide is only too happy to reveal some dramatic story about how he saved the day, devised some particularly ingenious idea, or prevented some terrible mistake.	这位不可或缺的助手也非常乐意透露一些关于他如何力挽狂澜，构思了一些特别巧妙的想法，或者制止了某些可怕错误的戏剧性故事。
But, as often as not, the soi-disant crucial figure oversteps.	但有时这位所谓重要人物也会玩得过火。
In the Reagan White House, Don Regan, who succeeded James Baker as Chief of Staff, fancied himself the prime minister: he inserted himself into photos of Reagan with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, was rude to lesser beings (including reporters), and made the fatal mistake of hanging up on Nancy Reagan, who was dedicated to looking after her Ronny.	在里根治下的白宫，接替詹姆斯·贝克（James Baker）担任幕僚长的唐·雷根（Don Regan）把自己当成了总理。 他让自己出现在了里根总统和苏联领导人米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫的合影中，对下属（包括记者）举止粗暴，而他的致命错误则是将千方百计想照顾自己丈夫的南希·里根拒之门外。
Regan was soon out.	结果雷根很快就被赶走了。
Presidents themselves aren’t particularly fond of reading how some super-smart aide saved their bacon.	而总统自己其实也并不特别喜欢读到那些超级助手如何挽救大局的故事。
All presidents have healthy egos – if others are so smart, why aren’t they president?	所有总统都有正常的自我认知 — — 如果他人如此睿智，为啥不把这些人选为总统？
The wise president-elect identifies a peacock and avoids the species from the start, or knows how to keep its feathers in check.	聪明的总统当选人会识别出那些爱出风头的家伙并从一开始就敬而远之，或者知道如何让他们收敛好自己。
Barack Obama was plenty pleased with himself, with reason, but such was his dignity that no super-aide emerged during his presidency.	比如奥巴马总统就有足够的理由自视甚高，而他的尊严就体现在他担任总统期间没有出现超级助手。
It didn’t occur to his advisers to try to outshine him.	他的顾问们也没有想去抢他的风头。
Stephen Bannon wasn’t particularly wise as a White House aide – he couldn’t contain his inner peacock – and Donald Trump’s ego is particularly fragile.	作为白宫助手，斯蒂芬·班农（Stephen Bannon）算不上特别聪明 — — 因为他无法遏制自己内心的表演欲 — — 而唐纳德·特朗普的自我又特别脆弱。
Both are or were misfits in their roles.	他们两人所扮演的角色是错位的。
Trump had spent his business life surrounded by family and flunkies: no stockholders or vice chairmen with their own ambitions.	特朗普过往的商界生涯都被家庭成员和朋友所环绕，没怎么和那些野心勃勃的股东或副主席打过交道。
The two men were a mismatch made in White House hell.	这两个人堪称是白宫地狱里的一对错配冤家。
As a candidate, Trump went with his instincts, and his instinct in the 2016 presidential race was that blue-collar workers and others who feared for their economic future needed their own victims, be they Mexican immigrants or billionaire bankers.	作为候选人，特朗普靠自己的直觉行事，而他在2016年总统竞选中的直觉就是蓝领工人和其他担心自身经济前景的人们需要找一个替罪羊 — — 不管是墨西哥移民还是亿万富翁银行家都行。
A wall – phantasmagorical or not – would keep out the “bad people” Mexico was “sending us.”	一堵墙 — — 无论是幻想还是真实 — — 会阻止墨西哥把“坏人 ” “ 送到我们这边 ” 。
As it happened, of all the people around Trump, Bannon most matched these views.	正如我们所看到的那样，在特朗普周围的所有人中班农与这些观点最为契合。
A person like Bannon – who presents himself as a learned figure and confirms one’s own brilliance – is a person one wants to have close by.	一个像班农这样的人 — — 看似极为睿智并且映衬出了总统的英明 — — 必然是成为亲密战友的好人选。
Trump is essentially a “whatever works” kind of guy.	特朗普本质上是个“拿来主义者 ” 。
Once elected, he brought in billionaires to populate his cabinet, and so far seems to have gotten away with telling his supporters that really rich people are needed to run the country.	当选后他邀请了多位亿万富豪来担任要职，到目前为止似乎已经成功避免他的支持者认为他需要一些真正有钱的人来经营这个国家。
Bannon, on the other hand, wrapped himself in what might be loosely termed a philosophy, which consisted of a nihilistic anger toward any “establishment.”	另一方面，班农则把自己包装成一种不太严谨的所谓哲学，其中包括对任何“体制”的无政府主义抵制。
But his was faux populism: while Bannon politically championed blue-collar workers, he lived on the millions he had attained from a stint at Goldman Sachs and through a fortunate investment in the TV comedy series “Seinfeld.”	但他的民粹主义其实是个假货：当班农在政治上为蓝领工人站台的时候，他手里的几百万美元却是靠当年在高盛集团任职以及对电视喜剧《宋飞正传（Seinfeld ） 》 的幸运投资赚来的。
He also flourished with backing from the billionaire Mercer family.	他的成功同时还来自于默瑟家族的支持。
The Mercers, who made their fortune through the high-tech genius of patriarch Robert Mercer and a hedge fund he led, fund Breitbart News, a far-right website formerly edited by Bannon that promotes ultra-nationalism and white supremacy, with a whiff of anti-Semitism.	这个家族依靠领头人罗伯特·默瑟（Robert Mercer）的高科技天才和旗下的对冲基金发了大财，并出资成立了极右翼的布莱因巴特新闻网（Breinbart News ） ， 该网站原先由班农编辑，着力宣传极端民族主义和白人至上思想，还有一点反犹太主义的意味。
Bannon’s ostensibly radical views were dressed up in a fancy set of principles embroidered with name-drops of far-out thinkers. In trade and immigration, for example, Bannon’s acquired philosophy aligned with Trump’s political opportunism (Trump’s more liberal, often Democrat-backing former self is another story).	班农会用一套花哨而充斥着新颖思想家名字的原则来粉饰自己表面上激进的观点，例如在贸易和移民方面，班农后天打造的哲学就和特朗普的政治机会主义相一致（特朗普从前更为自由主义，往往得到民主党支持的自我则是另一回事 ） 。
It was a mistake to see Bannon as Pygmalion to Trump’s Galatea, or, as some did, as the Trump White House’s Rasputin.	像某些人那样将班农视为皮格马利翁（Pygmalion ） ， 将特朗普视为他亲手打造的加拉蒂亚（Galatea ） ， 或者是特朗普白宫里的格利高里·拉斯普廷（Grigori Rasputin）都是错误的。
Bannon reinforced the nationalist inclination that led Trump to overrule his daughter Ivanka and his economic advisers by withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement.	班农强化了特朗普的民族主义倾向，导致后者推翻了其女伊万卡和经济顾问的建议撤出了巴黎气候协议。
And Bannon intruded on foreign policy by getting himself put on the National Security Council for a while, until two of the generals in Trump’s administration – National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster and John Kelly (now the chief of staff) – got him removed.	班农通过将自己安插在国家安全委员会一段时间以插手外交政策，直到特朗普当局的两名将军 — — 即国家安全顾问H·R·麦克马斯特（H. R. McMaster）和约翰·凯利（John Kelly，现任幕僚长）将他解职。
(Bannon was believed to be behind the recent push to force out McMaster, mainly by suggesting that he is “anti-Israel.”)	（据信班农在幕后推动了近期迫使麦克马斯特下台的动作，主要是声称他“反以色列 ” ）
But Bannon’s role as genius-without-portfolio – in which Trump indulged him, until Kelly arrived and clarified chains of command – was his undoing.	但班农所扮演的不管事天才角色 — — 特朗普对他如此着迷，直到凯利上任并理清了指挥链条才告终 — — 也是他失败的原因。
Without any defined responsibilities, he intruded where he wished – and ended up with a lot of enemies.	在缺乏任何明确责任的情况下，他肆意进入他所希望的领域 — — 最终结下了很多仇敌。
He had plenty of time to fight internal battles by feeding reporters stories about his White House rivals, though he would switch someone (for example, former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus) from rival to friend, as convenient.	尽管他可以很方便地将某人 — — 比如前幕僚长瑞因斯·普利巴斯（Reince Priebus ） — —从对手转化为朋友，但他却花了大量的时间在内斗上，向记者爆料自己的白宫对手。
Bannon was a troublemaker as much as a policymaker – and the two roles didn’t mesh.	班农既是个麻烦制造者又是个政策决策者 — — 这两个角色根本不相匹配。
Trump also began to see Bannon as a “leaker.”	特朗普也开始把班农看成是一个“告密者 ” 。
And Trump’s White House is all too leaky: many who work there let reporters know that they have, at best, mixed feelings about working for Trump, but believe the better part of valor is to stay and protect the country from his leadership.	而特朗普的白宫已经太多漏洞了，许多在那里工作的人都会告诉记者他们对于为特朗普工作的心情很复杂，但是相信最勇敢的事情莫过于留下来保护国家不受这位总统的荼毒。
Bannon’s braggadocio took him to the most dangerous terrain on which to confront Trump: the president’s obsession with his election victory.	班农的自负也把他带到了与特朗普对抗的最危险地带：总统对选举胜利的痴迷。
The ambiguity of winning the Electoral College vote (not, as he has falsely claimed, by the greatest margin since Reagan) but losing the popular vote by nearly three million votes, dogs Trump.	赢得了选举团投票（不是像他错误地宣称那样自里根以来最大的优势）却落后了近300万个人选票的纠结始终困扰着特朗普。
That’s why he invented millions of “illegal” voters and had maps printed showing the states he won in red – covering most of the territory of the United States – even suggesting to at least one reporter that his newspaper run the map on the paper’s front page.	这就是为什么他发明了数以百万计的“非法”选民并在地图上用红色来标识所赢得的州 — — 覆盖了美国的大部分领土 — — 甚至建议至少一名记者在其所属报纸的头版上展示该地图。
Suggestions by Bannon that he played a major role in Trump’s election victory were poisonous to the relationship between the two men.	而班农所谓在特朗普胜选中发挥了重要作用的说法损害了两人的关系。
And so this White House misfit finally had to go.	因此这对白宫冤家终于也无以为继了。
Now that Bannon is gone, however, he will hurl missives from his new-old perch at Breitbart, to which he returned the same day as his announced departure.	如今班农已不在，但他会在布莱因巴特新闻网的老窝里继续大放厥词 — — 他在宣布离职的同一天就回归了那里。
And Trump will still be Trump.	但是特朗普，还将是那个特朗普。
	
Why Barack Obama?	为什么要选择巴拉克·奥巴马？
NEW YORK – The winner of America’s presidential election will inherit a perfect storm of problems, both economic and international.	纽约 — — 美国总统选举的获胜者将在经济以及国际领域继承由一系列问题组成的完美风暴。
He will face the most difficult opening-day agenda of any president since – and I say this in all seriousness – the man who saved the Union, Abraham Lincoln.	我可以严肃的讲，他将面临着自挽救联邦的亚伯拉罕·林肯总统以后最艰巨的就职任务。
But a more instructive precedent is 1933, when Franklin Roosevelt offered inspiring rhetoric and “bold experimentation” to a nation facing economic meltdown and a breakdown in public confidence.	但1933年的先例能给我们以某种启示，当时富兰克林·罗斯福为一个处在经济灾难和公众信心崩溃边缘的民族奉献了鼓舞人心的讲演和“大胆的实验 ” 。
For me, the choice is simple – and not only because I am, by temperament and history, a Democrat.	对于我而言，选择非常简单 — — 这不光是因为我从天性和历史上看都是个不折不扣的民主党。
The long and intense political campaign has revealed huge differences in the two candidates’ positions, style, and personal qualities. And the conclusion seems clear.	漫长而激烈的政治竞选过程已经暴露了两位候选人在立场、作风和个人素质之间的巨大差异。
Judgment .	判断力。
John McCain has shown throughout his career a penchant for risk-taking; in his memoirs, he proudly calls himself a gambler.	纵观约翰·麦凯恩的职业生涯，他一贯表现出非常强烈的风险偏好，甚至在回忆录中骄傲地称自己为赌徒。
His selection of Sarah Palin, a charismatic but spectacularly unqualified candidate, as his running mate, is just the most glaring of many examples of the real McCain.	他选择拥有超凡魅力却根本达不到候选人要求的萨拉·佩林作为自己的竞选伙伴，这一突出例证恰好能够反映出麦凯恩的真实个性。
His bravery in combat attests to his patriotism, courage, and toughness, but his judgment has been found sorely lacking time and time again over his career.	他在战斗中的勇敢证明了他的爱国、勇气和坚定，但在他的职业生涯中，却时常表现出判断力的极度匮乏的弊病。
Barack Obama is tough, too, but in a different way.	巴拉克·奥巴马也非常坚定，但他的方式却有所不同。
No one should underestimate how difficult it was to travel his road, against incredible odds, to the cusp of the presidency.	谁也不该低估他所遇到的困难，面对着令人难以置信的种种不平等，他终于登上了总统竞选的巅峰。
But where McCain is impulsive and emotional, Obama is low-key and unemotional.	但如果说麦凯恩是冲动而感情用事，那么奥巴马的风格则是低调而理性。
He makes his judgments in a calm and methodical manner; McCain’s impulsiveness is anathema to Obama, and rightly so – one cannot play craps with history.	他以一种冷静而系统的方式做出决策，厌恶麦凯恩个性中的那种冲动，这种厌恶自有其道理 — — 因为任何人都不能拿历史当赌注。
Having seen so many political leaders falter under pressure, I prize this ability above most others.	因为曾经看到过如此多的政治领袖在压力面前动摇和畏缩，我把这种素质看得比其它多数能力更重。
And Barack Obama has it.	而巴拉克·奥巴马身上就具备这样的素质。
The economy .	经济。
The first priority of the new president will be the economy and the financial crisis.	应对经济和金融危机将成为新总统的首要任务。
Since the crisis hit, Obama has been calm and, indeed, presidential.	危机袭来后，奥巴马一直保持冷静，的确颇具总统之风。
He consulted the best advisory team in the nation, weighed each course of action carefully, and then issued a series of precise, calm statements.	他咨询了国内最高水平的顾问团队，仔细权衡了各种可能的行动，而后发表了一系列准确、冷静的声明。
Meanwhile, McCain has veered bizarrely, issuing contradictory statements, “suspending” his campaign (while continuing to campaign), and urging that the first debate be canceled (when it was all the more needed).	同时，麦凯恩却莫名其妙地改变态度，做出的声明都相互矛盾，他宣布“暂停”竞选活动（而同时却继续竞选 ） ， 并（在首次竞选辩论的必要性越来越迫切的时候）敦促取消这次辩论。
Advantage Obama.	麦凯恩的自相矛盾让奥巴马占尽了上风。
Foreign policy .	外交政策。
The most explicit disagreements between the candidates are over Iraq, Iran, and Russia.	候选人之间最明显的分歧是伊拉克、伊朗和俄罗斯政策。
But there are deeper differences.	但他们之间还有更深层次的差异。
McCain’s positions, with the notable exception of climate change, suggest that he would simply try to carry out George W. Bush’s policies more effectively.	麦凯恩的立场除去气候变化这个特殊问题外，表明他只会试图更有效地执行乔治·W·布什的政策。
Obama offers a different approach to foreign policy.	而奥巴马则会以一种完全不同的方式来处理外交问题。
By starting to draw down combat troops in Iraq, Obama would change the image and policies of America immediately.	通过开始减少在伊拉克的作战部队，奥巴马将立即改变美国的形象和政策。
By engaging Iran in talks that would cover not only the nuclear issue but other aspects of Iran’s destabilizing role in the region, he would either reach agreements that lowered the dangers from Iran, or he would mobilize a stronger international coalition to isolate Iran.	通过邀请伊朗参与不仅商讨核问题而且涉及伊朗在该地区其它领域所起不稳定作用的谈判，奥巴马或者能够达成降低伊朗危险性的协议，或者能够动员更强大的国际联盟来孤立伊朗。
Either way, engaging Iran is the right policy, and it is hard to understand why Bush and McCain have continued to hold out against such an obvious change of course, which, if carried out with firmness, will not compromise American or Israeli national security.	无论怎样，与伊朗保持接触都是正确的决定，很难理解布什和麦凯恩为什么一直坚持反对如此明显的路线变化。 如果新路线得到坚定不移的贯彻，将不会损害到美国或以色列的国家安全。
On Russia since its invasion of Georgia, Obama and his running mate, Joe Biden (who was the first member of Congress to visit Georgia after the invasion), emphasize helping Georgia rebuild its economy and maintain its independence in the face of a continuing Russian campaign against it.	俄国入侵格鲁吉亚后，奥巴马和他的竞选伙伴乔·拜登（入侵后第一位访问格鲁吉亚的参议员 ） ， 强调帮助格鲁吉亚重建国内经济，并在不断爆发的对俄战斗中保持自己的独立性。
McCain, on the other hand, wants to punish Russia by such actions as expelling it from the G-8.	另一方面，麦凯恩却希望通过诸如将俄国赶出八国集团这样的方式来惩罚俄国对格鲁吉亚的入侵。
Such measures may ultimately be necessary, but they will not help Georgia survive as an independent democracy.	采取这样的措施可能最终确有必要，但它们却丝毫无助于格鲁吉亚作为独立民主政体的生存。
Moreover, even after the outrage in Georgia, there are issues of common interest – such as energy, climate change, and Iran – on which the West and the Kremlin must cooperate.	此外，即便在格鲁吉亚暴行发生以后，西方和克里姆林之间仍然拥有需要合作维护的共同利益 — — 比如能源、气候变化和伊朗问题等等。
This was true even during the Cold War, and remains true today, yet McCain seems not to recognize it.	这样的现实即便在冷战期间也无法改变，今天也同样如此，可麦凯恩却似乎拒不承认。
Leadership .	领导力。
In the end, all presidential elections come down to the intangibles of leadership.	最终，所有的总统选举全部归结为无形的领导力。
The vote for a president is a sort of private contract directly between each voter and his or her preferred choice.	总统投票是每位选民和他或她所喜爱的领导人之间一份直接的私人合同。
Who do you want to see on your television screen for the next four years?	今后四年你希望在电视屏幕上看到谁的身影？
To whom do you wish to entrust the nation’s fate?&	你希望把国家的命运交给谁来掌控？
Here again, the contrasting styles of Obama and McCain offer a clear choice between a calm and confident man and a highly emotional one, between a major change in the nation’s direction and a minor one, between a conciliatory style and a more combative one.	说到这儿，奥巴马和麦凯恩迥异的风格让你有机会在冷静自信和高度情绪化的两个男人间做出明确的选择，你可以选择让国家方向做出重大变化，也可以选择在大体上维持原来的路线。 你还可以在温和与好斗的行为模式之间做出选择。
Effectiveness .	有效性。
Finally, in a year in which the Democrats are certain to increase their majority in both houses of Congress, an Obama victory would offer the Democrats control of both the legislative and executive branches for the first time since 1994, and with it the possibility of legislative achievement after years of stalemate.	最后，在一个民主党人确定会在参众两院扩大领先优势的年份，奥巴马获胜会使民主党人从1994年以后第一次控制立法和行政机构，从而在多年僵局之后出现取得立法进展的可能性。
After so many years of polarization at home and unilateralism abroad, the choice for president seems clear.	在这么多年的国内分化和国外单边主义之后，很明显该选择谁来担任总统。
	
Why Big Banks Will Get Bigger	为什么大银行成了危机赢家
FLORENCE – Severe banking crises bring painful and long-lasting disruptions. But they also lead to surprises.	佛罗伦萨 — — 我们都认识历次银行大危机的一个产物：痛苦而长期的经济干扰；但它们的另一些产物却出人意料。
The lessons learned in the immediate aftermath bear little relationship to the eventual outcome.	危机当头，人们都会总结出若干教训，但危机后的世界如何演变，跟这些教训往往没啥关系。
There are immediate and obvious answers to the question of who was to blame, but they rarely correspond with the new shape of the financial landscape that ultimately emerges.	谁是危机的罪魁祸首，回答这个问题似乎再容易不过，但不论谁受到谴责，这种谴责都不会影响到最终出现的金融新格局。
The crisis that began in 2007 originated in the sub-prime mortgage sector in the United States, and in US banks that were “too big to fail,” prompting many observers at the outset to predict the end of American financial capitalism.	肇始于 2007 年美国次贷危机的这一轮金融海啸，起源地是美国一些“大到倒不得”的银行。 危机伊始，不少观察家便由此断定，它标志着美国式金融资本主义的终结。
But the banks that were most affected were elsewhere, and the long-term winners will be a few American banks – including some of the most notoriously weak banks – which will get bigger as a result of the crisis.	然而，如今看来，美国的银行反倒不是危机的最大受害者，其中颇有一些 — — 包括几家出了名的问题银行 — — 居然在危机中坐大，成了长时段上的赢家。
Fueled by the injection of taxpayers’ money, American capitalism is back in force.	用大把纳税人的钱输了血以后，美式资本主义卷土重来。
The explanation of why the obvious lessons of the crisis are being not drawn lies in the curious character of financial activity.	为什么危机的教训明明摆在那里，人们偏偏不吸取？ 根源在于金融活动的一个奇怪特性。
Banking is inherently competitive; but at the same time, it is not an industry where competition ever worked very well.	银行业固然是个存在竞争的行业，但这个行业的竞争，从来都是不充分的。
The core of financial activity depends on reputation, information networks, and the ability to make markets as well as trade on them.	金融活动的核心在于信誉、信息网、从事市场交易以及营造市场（做市）的能力。
The result is that there are indisputable advantages to being big, as well as the disadvantages that have become obvious over the past two years.	因此，规模大的金融机构，虽然也具有过去两年所暴露出来的一些劣势，但它们所拥有的优势更是无可争议的。
The market tends to be dominated by a relatively small number of firms.	金融市场天然倾向于寡头主导。
In the old days, when banking was stable and regulated securely in a national setting, three or four leading banks tended to form an oligopoly: Barclays, Lloyds, Midland, and National Westminster in the United Kingdom; Commerzbank, Deutsche, and Dresdner in Germany.	过去，金融业在国家层面上受到稳妥监管，整体比较稳定，往往是三四家大银行形成寡头垄断：英国有巴克莱（ Barclays ） 、 劳埃德（ Lloyds ） 、 米德兰（ Midland ）和国民威斯特敏斯特（ National Westminster ） ； 德国有商业银行（ Commerzbank ） 、 德意志（ Deutsche ）和德累斯顿（ Dresdner ） 。
There were always suspicions of formal or informal banking cartels, which would agree on conditions and interest rates.	一直有人怀疑，存在着正式或非正式的银行业卡特尔，操纵着市场上的放贷条件和利率水平。
Regulators generally turned a blind eye to these suspicions.	对于此类怀疑，监管者的普遍态度是睁一只眼闭一只眼。
In the 1990’s and 2000’s, internationalization promised to produce a new landscape, in which a small handful of banks would once again divide up a single global market.	最近二十年，金融国际化趋势渐渐催生一种新格局：一小撮银行瓜分全球大市场。
Banks maneuvered to get the best position to take advantage of financial globalization, which usually meant locating themselves where the regulatory regime was least restrictive.	各大银行不择手段，抢占有利地形，欲占金融全球化鳌头 — — 最常见的伎俩则是，向金融监管最松弛的地区转移。
Banks got much bigger very quickly, and bigness brought problems.	银行规模急剧扩张，扩张的规模则带来麻烦。
As they grew, banks found it difficult to manage the multiplicity of their divergent activities.	伴随着体量疯涨，许多银行都发觉，要管理千头万绪的庞杂业务越来越让人头疼。
They were beset with incompatible computer software systems, rogue employees, and the need to account for the different national cultures in which they were now operating.	电脑软件系统总是差口气，员工工作效率总嫌不够高，跨国运营所遭遇的文化差异也令人疲于应付。
Almost inevitably, the biggest banks in the world got into trouble.	于是，银行巨无霸陷入困境，几乎成了一种宿命。
In the 1990’s, the largest banks were mostly Japanese. Who now remembers Daiichi Kangyo?	20 世纪 90 年代，世界上最大的银行几乎都是日资银行，可如今谁还记得第一劝业（ Dai-Ichi Kangyo ） ？
The financial crisis has produced a new answer to where the greatest competitive advantages lie.	什么才是金融业最大的竞争优势？ 这一轮金融危机给出了一个全新的答案。
From banks’ perspective, the most obvious lesson was the need for a strong national government to bear the potential costs of a rescue.	银行这回认识到，国家政府负担金融业救助成本的能力至关重要。
It is no longer best to be subject to the most favorable regulatory regime, but to be where the state has the deepest pockets.	它们现在想的，不再是到哪个岛国上去享用最宽松的监管，而是如何去傍一个荷包鼓鼓的大款政府。
Very large banks in small territories with small-scale governments are vulnerable.	小国家、小政府管辖下的大银行很脆弱。
The US is big enough to handle behemoths like Bank of America or Citigroup.	美国够大，可以帮美银（ America ）和花旗（ Citigroup ）这样的大恐龙擦屁股。
China can handle its large banks, even if they have large portfolios of poor credits.	中国也能罩着它的大银行，虽然后者的资产组合里颇有一些呆坏账。
European banks are in a more precarious situation.	欧洲银行的处境就可怜一些。
Ireland and Iceland have become notorious cases where a financial sector metastasized and destroyed the host country.	爱尔兰和冰岛的金融业畸形膨胀，压垮了自己的国家，让全世界看得目瞪口呆。
Even in France and Germany, large and internationally active banks potentially exceed the government’s capacity to mount a rescue.	就连法国和德国这样的欧洲大国，政府救助金融业的能力也是有限的，未必招架得住那些跨国大银行惹的麻烦。
In addition, there is the complexity of disentangling which country is responsible for what part of a rescue, when, for instance, Central European banks are controlled by an Austrian bank that is bought by a German bank that is then bought by an Italian bank.	此外，要搞清楚哪个政府该救哪一块，也是个麻烦事儿，举个例子：几家中欧的银行，由一家奥地利银行控股，这家奥地利银��被一家德国银行收购，那家德国银行的老板又是一家意大利银行 — — 谁能理清这一团乱麻？
As a result, the big transnational institutions are lobbying hard for a pan-European approach to banking supervision and regulation (and implicitly for fiscal bailouts should that supervision and regulation fail).	所以，几家跨国大行目前正在苦苦游说欧洲各国，希望建立其一个泛欧洲的银行业监管规制体系（言外之意，如果那样的监管和规制再失灵，财政救助也就是整个欧洲的事儿了 ） 。
In the case of the banks that required state rescues, European competition rules are requiring divestment and downsizing.	至于已经申请国家救助的那些银行，根据欧盟的竞争法规，要对他们进行撤资和瘦身。
Institutions such as Royal Bank of Scotland, which for a time in 2009 headed the list of the world’s largest international banks, are being pruned by the EU’s Directorate General for Competition.	一度位居国际大行排行榜榜首苏格兰皇家银行（ Royal Bank of Scotland ）这样一棵大树，也正受欧盟委员会竞争总署（ Directorate General for Competition ）的修剪。
Even the stronger banks are being pressed to increase their capital reserves.	就连相对健康的银行也被迫充实其资本金。
In most cases, this means that they will continue to cut back on lending, worsening the impact of the financial crisis on the rest of the economy.	这通常会促使它们继续收缩放贷规模，这对饱受金融危机创伤的世界经济可不是什么好消息。
By contrast, in the US, the government pushed big banks into buying up smaller and vulnerable banks, and is now doing everything it can to press them to lend more.	相反，美国政府正在怂恿大银行兼并弱小和生病的银行，并且用尽一切手段逼它们放贷。
Government reactions are full of paradoxes.	政府干预的后果十分诡异。
The more we insist that a banking system should be competitive, the greater the risks that individual banks will take.	越是鼓励银行体系放开竞争，个别银行就越是会盲目冒险。
The more governments are prepared to step in, and the greater the resources of those governments, the more big banks and big countries will be favored.	政府越是出手干预，干预的能力越是强，就越是有利于大银行和大国。
The last 20 years of globalization saw the emergence of small, open economies as global leaders.	最近二十年的全球化见证了小型开放经济崛起为全球领先者的奇迹。
The next 20 years will see a different globalization, in which the winners are large, powerful countries that mobilize government resources in the interest of creating winners in the race for financial supremacy.	未来二十年将会是另一种逻辑的全球化，将来的赢家会是那些大国强国，只有它们才能动员庞大的政府资源，扶植自己的嫡系部队，在金融争霸赛中胜出。
	
Why Bipartisanship is Good Politics	为什么两党合作是治国良方
LONDON – Bipartisanship seems to have taken a drubbing in Washington since President Barack Obama got to the White House.	伦敦-自奥巴马入主白宫以来，在华盛顿的两党合作似乎遭到了重创。
Like most recent American presidents, Obama campaigned on a promise to work with his political opponents for the greater good of the country.	像最近几任美国总统一样，奥巴马竞选中承诺说为了更大的国家利益要与他的政治对手们合作。
Bill Clinton said much the same thing before he was elected, and then spent his first term in a knockdown fight with Newt Gingrich’s Republican majority in Congress, and his second term fighting off impeachment.	克林顿在他当选之前也说了同样的话，然而在他当选后的第一任期中对纽特·金里奇领导的在国会占多数的共和党进行打击，在他的第二个任期中忙于击退对他的弹劾。
George W. Bush also said that he would reach out to those who disagreed with him.	布什也曾说，他将和不同意见的人合作。
He then turned into the most partisan and ideological president of modern times, egged on by his vice-president, Dick Cheney.	但后来他却变成了现代史上最具有党派观念和善于空谈的总统，并和他的副总统切尼一唱一和。
Obama already appears to have gone further in the pursuit of bipartisanship than his predecessors.	比起他的前任们来，奥巴马似乎在追求两党合作方面走得更进了一步。
His selection of Republicans for key posts – including retaining Robert Gates as Secretary of Defense – has raised a few eyebrows among his supporters.	他选择的担任重要职位的共和党人-包括保留罗伯特·盖茨担任国防部长-着实让一些他的支持者吃惊。
But, above all, he has tried hard to secure Republican support for his efforts to prevent the economy from disappearing into a deep recessionary hole.	但是，最重要的是，在为了防止经济滑向衰退的无底洞的努力上，他已尽力地争取共和党对他的支持。
Only three maverick Republican Senators went along with Obama’s proposals to get the plan accepted.	只有三位特立独行的共和党参议员同意奥巴马的方案被通过。
And in the House of Representatives, the Republicans unanimously rejected every amendment, every compromise, and every courtesy that he offered.	在众议院，全体共和党人一致拒绝奥巴马提出的每一项修正方案、每一个妥协的方案以及每一个礼貌的姿态。
Some commentators suggest that Obama made a bad mistake.	一些评论家认为，奥巴马犯了严重的错误。
First, he promised bipartisanship, but got heavily rebuffed.	首先，他承诺要进行两党合作，但却遭遇了沉重的挫折。
Second, he and his administration were so busy trying to build consensus that they watered down some of the vital ingredients of the stimulus package, and failed to defend it robustly from Republican attack.	第二，他和他的政府如此急于要建立共识而淡化了其刺激方案中一些关键因素，在共和党的攻击下没法捍卫其刺激方案。
There may sometimes be a downside in trying to woo your opponents.	当你试图去讨好对手的时候，有时会产生负面影响。
When they are plainly wrong, why let them off the hook?	当你的对手明显错误的时候，为什么不反击他们呢？
Here we have had Republicans criticizing an increase in America’s budget deficit after doubling America’s national debt in the Bush presidency’s eight years.	当美国的国债在布什总统当政的八年里增加了一倍之后，我们却看到共和党人在批评美国的预算赤字的增加。
Moreover, Republicans’ belief that only tax cuts, not public spending, will delivery recovery is a sad example of blinkered ideology.	此外，共和党人认为只有减税而不是公共开支才能带来复苏，这是不开化脑筋的一个可悲的例子。
But there are more positive reasons for Obama effort at bipartisanship.	但奥巴马在争取两党合作上的努力也有更积极的理由。
In any democratic system of checks and balances, leaders usually require coalitions in order to get what they want done.	任何民主的制衡制度，领导人通常需要形成联盟以完成他们想要做的事情。
Moreover, a consensual style is good politics.	此外，在协商一致的风格是治国的良方。
Most voters – certainly swing voters, who usually decide elections – do not like partisan battles as much as some politicians and their supporters do.	大多数选民-当然包括摇摆不定的选民，而通常是他们的票数最后决定了选举的结果-和政客以及其追随者不一样，他们不那么喜欢党派斗争。
After all, the wise, the moderate, and the floating voter do not switch on the radio to listen to archconservatives like the American broadcaster Rush Limbaugh.	毕竟，那些明智的、温和的和无党派的流动选民们不会打开收音机听极端保守派们如美国的全国联网电台主持人拉什·林堡的节目。
When things get tough in politics, as will happen in most of the world as we struggle with the impact of the global recession, every sensible government will try to hang on to the benefit of doubt. It is the most important attribute in politics.	当治理国家很困难的时候，世界上大多数国家在为应付全球经济衰退带来的影响的时候会将会发生这样的情况，每一个明智的政府都会极力抓住遇事宁愿往好处想的大众心理，这是政治最重要的特性。
Citizens know that running a country, especially in a time like this, is tough.	公民们都知道，管理一个国家，尤其是在这样的时刻，是很难的。
They are prepared to spare governments from too much criticism, if they think they are trying to do what is right for everyone.	如果他们认为政府在为之努力的事情对每一个人都是有好处的，他们也准备不对政府过于苛求。
They bridle at a government that must do unpopular things and that also looks narrow and mean-spirited.	他们为之生气的是尽管政府必须做不讨人喜欢的事，但这个政府看上去心胸狭隘且卑鄙。
There is also a lot to be said for making political argument more civil.	在让政治争论更心平气和方面，也很值得一谈。
Ronald Reagan had a strong ideological bent.	罗纳德·里根有着强烈的意识形态的倾向。
He reshaped American politics, pulling the center firmly to the right.	他改变了美国的政治，他坚定地把中间派拉向了右派。
But he did so without ever seeming to despise his opponents or disparage their intentions.	但他似乎从来也没有瞧不起他的对手或贬低他们的意旨。
Obama’s aides have confessed that he modeled his own election program on the sunny and optimistic decency of the Republican actor.	奥巴马的助手曾承认，奥巴马自己的竞选规划是他模仿这位共和党演员的阳光和乐观的正派作风的而制定的。
Civility in politics is not simply political confectionery.	政治中的礼貌态度不仅是政治糖果。
A leader who respects his or her opponents is more likely to earn respect himself than one who doubts their patriotism and resents their criticism.	尊重其对手的领袖，比起怀疑他人的爱国主义和憎恶批评的人，更有可能为自己赢得尊重。
One reason for the widespread respect felt for Nelson Mandela is that years of imprisonment did not embitter him.	纳尔逊·曼德拉普遍受到尊敬的一个原因是，多年的监禁并没有使他产生怨恨。
Jawaharlal Nehru was hugely popular because he was known to cherish free speech, take seriously the views of his critics, and defend their right to disagree with him.	贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁非常受欢迎的原因是因为大家知道他珍惜言论自由，认真对待批评他的人的意见，并捍卫他们和他持不同意见的权利。
His role in establishing enduring democracy in India, despite the tensions of caste, ethnicity, religion, and regional loyalties, made him one of the towering figures of the twentieth century.	他在把印度建成巩固持久的民主国家方面所起的作用，尽管有种姓、种族、宗教和区域忠诚方面的紧张关系，仍然使他成为20世纪的伟人之一。
So my own hope is that Obama will not be dissuaded from trying to work with his opponents, to build consensus, and to deal courteously even with those whose views he may thoroughly dislike.	所以我自己怀有的希望是，奥巴马不会被说服停止与对手的合作和共识的建立，也不会不再有礼貌地与即使持让他及其厌恶的意见的人打交道。
Personally, I do not think that those whose philosophy deplores the whole idea of government, except when it is required to bail out businesses or banks, and who purport to offer a better future by stitching together the shreds and tatters of policies that helped produce today’s economic disaster, will have much respect or support from voters.	就个人而言，那些对政府的作用不屑一顾（除了在需要政府为企业或银行摆脱困境的时候）而把那些导致目前的经济大灾难的政策缝缝补补后就声称可以创造更美好的未来的人们，将会获得选民的多大的尊重和支持。
Even in Washington, there is not much to be said for being partisan, unpopular, and wrong.	即使在华盛顿，关于那些热衷党派斗争而变得不受欢迎和错误百出的现象，也没有什么值得一说的。
	
Blockchain’s Broken Promises	区块链的虚伪承诺
NEW YORK – The financial-services industry has been undergoing a revolution.	
But the driving force is not overhyped blockchain applications such as Bitcoin. It is a revolution built on artificial intelligence, big data, and the Internet of Things.	发自纽约 — — 金融服务业正在经历一场革命，但其推动力并不是比特币这类被过度夸大的区块链应用，而是一场以人工智能，大数据和物联网为基础的革命。
Already, thousands of real businesses are using these technologies to disrupt every aspect of financial intermediation.	数千家实体企业已经应用了这些技术来击穿金融中介的各个方面。
Dozens of online-payment services – PayPal, Alipay, WeChat Pay, Venmo, and so forth – have hundreds of millions of daily users.	PayPal，支付宝，微信支付，Venmo等数十种在线支付服务拥有数以亿计的日常用户。
And financial institutions are making precise lending decisions in seconds rather than weeks, thanks to a wealth of online data on individuals and firms.	基于大量的个人和企业在线数据，金融机构能在几秒钟内做出准确的贷款决定，而不是几周。
With time, such data-driven improvements in credit allocation could even eliminate cyclical credit-driven booms and busts.	随着时间的推移，这种数据驱动的信贷分配提升甚至可以消除周期性的信贷驱动型繁荣和萧条。
Similarly, insurance underwriting, claims assessment and management, and fraud monitoring have all become faster and more precise.	同样，保险业的承保，理赔评估和管理以及欺诈监控都会变得更快更准。
And actively managed portfolios are increasingly being replaced by passive robo-advisers, which can perform just as well or better than conflicted, high-fee financial advisers.	进取型管理的投资组合越来越被被动式的机器人顾问所取代，而它们的表现相比于时而自相矛盾且收费高昂的财务顾问来说或许一致或更佳。
Now, compare this real and ongoing fintech revolution with the record of blockchain, which has existed for almost a decade, and still has only one application: cryptocurrencies.	如今，让我们试将这个真实且正在进行的金融科技革命与已经存在了近十年且仍然只有一项应用（加密货币）的区块链应用记录进行比较。
Blockchain’s boosters would argue that its early days resemble the early days of the Internet, before it had commercial applications.	区块链的鼓吹者会辩解说在实现商业应用之前，其早期阶段类似于互联网的早期阶段。
But that comparison is simply false. Whereas the Internet quickly gave rise to email, the World Wide Web, and millions of viable commercial ventures used by billions of people, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin do not even fulfill their own stated purpose.	但是这个比较是错的，互联网很快催生了电子邮件，万维网以及被数十亿人所使用的数以百万计的可运行商业企业，但是像比特币这样的加密货币甚至连其赋予自身的目的都无法满足。
As a currency, Bitcoin should be a serviceable unit of account, means of payments, and a stable store of value. It is none of those things.	作为一种货币，比特币应该是可供使用的账户单位，支付手段和稳定的价值储备。
No one prices anything in Bitcoin.	但这些目的它都没能实现。
Few retailers accept it. And it is a poor store of value, because its price can fluctuate by 20-30% in a single day.	没有人用比特币来标价；很少有零售商接受它；价值储备功能也很糟糕，因为它的价格可以在一天内波动20~30 ％ 。
Worse, cryptocurrencies in general are based on a false premise.	更糟的是，加密货币通常是基于一个错误的前提。
According to its promoters, Bitcoin has a steady-state supply of 21 million units, so it cannot be debased like fiat currencies.	根据其推广者的说法，比特币只拥有2100万单位的稳定供应量，因此不会像法定货币那样贬值。
But that claim is clearly fraudulent, considering that it has already forked off into three branches: Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Gold. Besides, hundreds of other cryptocurrencies are invented every day, alongside scams known as “initial coin offerings,” which are mostly designed to skirt securities laws.	但是这种说法显然是欺诈性的，因为它已经分成了三个分支：比特现金（Bitcoin Cash ） ， 莱特币（Litecoin）和比特金（Bitcoin Gold ） ， 此外每天还会创设出数百种主要是为了摆脱相关证券法律法规而设计的其他加密货币，还有所谓“初始供应币 ” （ initial coin offerings）的骗局。
So “stable” cryptos are creating money supply and debasing it at a much faster pace than any major central bank ever has.	所以“稳定”的加密算法一面创造货币供应，同时又以比任何大型央行都快得多的速度将其贬值。
As is typical of a financial bubble, investors are buying cryptocurrencies not to use in transactions, but because they expect them to increase in value.	就像典型的金融泡沫一样，投资者购买加密货币并不是为了交易，而是期望它们能增值。
Indeed, if someone actually wanted to use Bitcoin, they would have a hard time doing so.	事实上，如果有人真的想使用比特币，过程也会相当麻烦。
It is so energy-intensive (and thus environmentally toxic) to produce, and carries such high transaction costs, that even Bitcoin conferences do not accept it as a valid form of payment.	这类货币的生产耗能极大（因此毒害环境 ） ， 并附带很高的交易成本，甚至连跟比特币有关的会议也不愿接受其作为有效的支付方式。
Until now, Bitcoin’s only real use has been to facilitate illegal activities such as drug transactions, tax evasion, avoidance of capital controls, or money laundering.	到目前为止，比特币的唯一真正用途是促进诸如毒品交易，逃税，避免资本管制或洗钱等非法活动。
Not surprisingly, G20 member states are now working together to regulate cryptocurrencies and eliminate the anonymity they supposedly afford, by requiring that all income- or capital-gains-generating transactions be reported.	不出意料，G20成员国现正通力合作，通过要求对所有收入或产生资本收益的交易进行申报来监管加密货币并消除它们所谓的匿名性。
After a crackdown by Asian regulators this month, cryptocurrency values fell by 50% from their December peak.	在本月遭受亚洲监管机构打压之后，加密货币的价值从12月份的高点下跌了50 ％ 。
They would have collapsed much more had a vast scheme to prop up their price via outright manipulation not been rapidly implemented.	如果不是某些方面迅速实施了一项庞大计划来公然操纵其价格，那么这一崩溃还会更严重。
But, like in the case of the sub-prime bubble, most US regulators are still asleep at the wheel.	但就像次贷泡沫一样，大多数美国监管机构依然在睡梦中，浑然不知危机已近。
Since the invention of money thousands of years ago, there has never been a monetary system with hundreds of different currencies operating alongside one another.	自从数千年前货币发明以来，从来没有出现过一个有数百种不同货币并存的货币体系。
The entire point of money is that it allows parties to transact without having to barter.	货币的存在意义在于允许各方在无须交换的情况下进行交易。
But for money to have value, and to generate economies of scale, only so many currencies can operate at the same time.	但是为了让货币有价值，并且要产生规模经济，只能允许特定数量的货币同时运作。
In the US, the reason we do not use euros or yen in addition to dollars is obvious: doing so would be pointless, and it would make the economy far less efficient.	我们不会在美国国内使用除美元以外的其他货币（比如日元或欧元）的原因是显而易见的：这样做毫无意义，而且会使经济效率下降。
The idea that hundreds of cryptocurrencies could viably operate together not only contradicts the very concept of money; it is utterly idiotic.	数以百计的加密货币可以一起运作的想法不仅与货币的概念相矛盾；而且是彻彻底底的愚蠢。
But so, too, is the idea that even a single cryptocurrency could substitute for fiat money.	而所谓单一加密货币可以取代法定货币的想法也是如此。
Cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value, whereas fiat currencies certainly do, because they can be used to pay taxes.	加密货币没有内在价值，而法定货币则有，因为后者可以用来纳税。
Fiat currencies are also protected from value debasement by central banks committed to price stability; and if a fiat currency loses credibility, as in some weak monetary systems with high inflation, it will be swapped out for more stable foreign fiat currencies or real assets.	法定货币也会受到贬值保护，因为各央行都承诺保持价格稳定；如果一个法定货币像在某些高通胀弱势货币体系中那样失去信誉，它就被换成更稳定的外币或实物资产。
As it happens, Bitcoin’s supposed advantage is also its Achilles’s heel, because even if it actually did have a steady-state supply of 21 million units, that would disqualify it as a viable currency.	碰巧的是，比特币所谓的优势也是它的致命弱点，因为即使实际上确实有稳定的2100万单位供应量也无法使其成为一个可行的货币。
Unless the supply of a currency tracks potential nominal GDP, prices will undergo deflation.	除非能货币供应能与潜在的名义GDP挂钩，否则价格就将出现通缩。
That means if a steady-state supply of Bitcoin really did gradually replace a fiat currency, the price index of all goods and services would continuously fall.	这意味着如果比特币的稳定状态供应确实逐渐取代了某一法定货币，那么所有商品和服务的价格指数将不断下降。
By extension, any nominal debt contract denominated in Bitcoin would rise in real value over time, leading to the kind of debt deflation that economist Irving Fisher believed precipitated the Great Depression.	此外，以比特币计价的任何名义债务合约将随着时间的推移而出现实际价值上涨，导致经济学家欧文·费雪（Irving Fisher）认为促成了大萧条的那种债务通缩。
At the same time, nominal wages in Bitcoin would increase forever in real terms, regardless of productivity growth, adding further to the likelihood of an economic disaster.	与此同时，无论生产率如何增长，以比特币计算的名义工资实际上将永远增长，进一步增加了爆发经济灾难的可能性。
Clearly, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies represent the mother of all bubbles, which explains why every human being I met between Thanksgiving and Christmas of 2017 asked me if they should buy them.	很显然，比特币和其他加密货币形同于所有泡沫之母，这就解释了为什么我在2017年感恩节和圣诞节之间遇到的每个人都问我是否应该买一点。
Scammers, swindlers, charlatans, and carnival barkers (all conflicted insiders) have tapped into clueless retail investors’ FOMO (“fear of missing out”), and taken them for a ride.	作局者、诈骗犯、伪专家和拉客仔（都是利益相互冲突的内幕人士）都吃准了无知散户投资者害怕踏空的心理，并把他们骗个干净。
As for the underlying blockchain technology, there are still massive obstacles standing in its way, even if it has more potential than cryptocurrencies.	至于底层区块链技术，即使它比加密货币更有潜力，但其推广仍然存在巨大的障碍。
Chief among them is that it lacks the kind of basic common and universal protocols that made the Internet universally accessible (TCP-IP, HTML, and so forth).	其中最主要的是它缺乏可以像互联网那样被广泛访问的基础共同通用协议（TCP-IP，HTML等 ） 。
More fundamentally, its promise of decentralized transactions with no intermediary authority amounts to an untested, Utopian pipedream.	更根本的是，它关于去中介去中心化交易的承诺如同一个未经考验的乌托邦式白日梦。
No wonder blockchain is ranked close to the peak of the hype cycle of technologies with inflated expectations.	也难怪区块链在技术成熟度曲线中几乎位于曲线顶端且伴随着虚高的预期。
So, forget about blockchain, Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, and start investing in fintech firms with actual business models, which are slogging away to revolutionize the financial-services industry.	所以请忘掉区块链，比特币和其他加密货币，并着手投资于那些拥有真实商业模式的，正在为金融服务业带来革命性冲击的金融科技企业。
You won’t get rich overnight; but you’ll have made the smarter investment.	它们不会让你一夜暴富；但你的投资一定会是更明智的。
	
Did the Bankers Do It?	真是银行家干的？
NEW DELHI – Few areas of economic activity in the United States are more politicized than housing finance.	新德里—在美国，没有什么经济活动领域比住房融资更加政治化了。
Yet the intellectual left has gone to great lengths to absolve regulators, government lending mandates, and agencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of any responsibility for the housing boom and the subsequent bust.	但思想左翼在为监管者、政府借贷指令、房利美和房地美等机构开脱造成房地产泡沫及随后的破灭的责任方面走得很远。
The rationale is clear: if these officials, institutions, and policies were held accountable, the reform agenda would necessarily shift from regulating greedy bankers and their bonuses to asking broader questions.	逻辑是明确的：既然这批官员、机构和政策都是可问责的，那么改革日程就应该从监管贪婪银行家及其奖金转为质疑更宏大的问题。
Might government mandates contribute to bad behavior by private players?	政府放权有可能是私人行为人不良行为的帮凶吗？
Can regulators be trusted to make appropriate trade-offs between financial stability and mandates that have wide political support?	可以放心让监管者做出金融稳定和政治支持度高的授权之间的权衡吗？
Indeed, can central bankers be truly independent?	中央银行真的是独立的吗？
Unquestioning acceptance of a greater government role in taming markets would, in short, give way to asking whether that role can sometimes be part of the problem.	简言之，不置疑地接受政府在驯服市场上扮演更大作用不禁让人疑问，这样的作用有时也可能成为问题的一部分。
The left has had an easy task in dominating the debate, partly because the intellectual right’s attempt to place all the blame for the crisis on government is thoroughly implausible.	左派轻而易举地就主导了争论，这部分是因为思想右派将所有危机肇因归咎于政府的做法实在站不住脚。
It is far more defensible and correct to argue that everyone – bankers, households, regulators, and politicians – contributed to (and took credit for) the boom while it lasted, only to point fingers at one another when it collapsed.	更有力也更正确的观点是，所有人 — — 银行家、家庭、监管者和政客 — — 都在泡沫的持续发展中起了作用，当泡沫破裂时，他们开始玩起相互指责的游戏来。
But bankers’ political tin ear in the aftermath of the crisis – first taking public bailouts and then paying themselves huge bonuses as if nothing had changed – ensured that they got the lion’s share of the blame, with everyone else willing to pose as their unwitting victims.	但银行家在危机之后的政治不正确 — — 在接受了公共援助后为自己发放大笔奖金，好像什么都没有发生变化似的 — — 使得他们遭受了最大的指责，所有其他人都乐意担任他们的不知情的受害者。
As a result, the public-policy response has been dominated by “the bankers did it” narrative.	结果，公共政策反应被“这是银行家干的”的论调所主导。
The risk is that this approach is incomplete – and thus unlikely to be effective.	这其中的风险在于，这一观点是不完善的，因此也不可能是正确的。
It is therefore refreshing to see a careful econometric study take on an assertion by Paul Krugman, perhaps the most influential left-leaning US economist, that “the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 was irrelevant to the subprime boom.”	因此，一份仔细的计量经济学研究对也许是美国最有影响力的左倾经济学家的克鲁格曼的“1977年社区再投资法（Community Reinvestment Act，CRA）与次贷繁荣不相关”论点所做的批评令人眼前一亮。
The CRA instructs federal financial supervisory agencies to encourage the institutions that they regulate to help the communities in which they are chartered to meet their credit needs, while also conforming to “safe and sound” standards.	作为CRA要求联邦金融监督机构鼓励其所监管的机构帮助所在社区满足信用需求，同时需满足“安全稳固”标准。
In practice, regulators measure the volume of lending to CRA target tracts – poor areas with median income less than 80% of the median income of the local community – as well as to low-income and minority borrowers in non-CRA tracts to verify compliance with the Act.	在实践中，监管者所使用的该法执行检查指标包括CRA目标区域 — — 中位收入低于当地社区中位收入80%的贫困地区 — — 的贷款量以及非CRA目标区域中低收入和少数族裔借款人的贷款量。
The left has dismissed any claim that the CRA played a role in the housing boom by pointing out that it was enacted in 1977, while the subprime boom played out in the early 2000’s.	左派拒绝承认所有CRA在1977年实施后催生了房地产繁荣的观点，而次贷繁荣在21世纪初结束。
But this ignores the possibility that regulators may have started to enforce the CRA rigorously only later.	但这忽略了一种可能性：监管者只能在之后大力推进CRA。
To enforce the statute, regulators periodically examine banks for CRA compliance.	为了加强执法，监管者定期检查银行的CRA执行情况。
To hone in on the “regulatory enforcement” effect, the recent study compares the behavior of banks that are undergoing examination (which takes place over several quarters) to that of banks that are not undergoing examination in a particular tract in a particular month.	为了增强“监管强化”效果，最新研究比较了被检查的银行（在几个季度中）和在某个月的某个目标区域没有受到检查的银行的行为区别。
The findings are clear.	结论是清晰的。
Compared to banks that are not undergoing examination, the volume of loans by banks in the six quarters surrounding a CRA examination is 5% higher, and these loans are 15% more likely to be delinquent one year after origination.	与没有受到检查的银行相比，六个季度中受到CRA检查的银行的贷款量要高出5 % ， 且这些贷款在发出一年后被拖欠的可能性要高15 % 。
In other words, banks undergoing examination lend more and make riskier loans – and these findings are even more pronounced in CRA-eligible tracts.	换句话说，接受检查的银行贷款更多，贷款风险也更大，这一发现在符合条件的CRA目标区域更加显著。
Good econometric studies examine secondary effects to persuade readers that the main effect is what it is.	优秀的计量经济学研究还考察了次级效应，以说服读者主要效应确有其事。
Regulators’ primary tool to enforce compliance was their authority to reject non-CRA-compliant banks’ requests for new branches or mergers.	监管者强化执行的主要工具是拒绝不执行CRA的银行开设新分行或开展兼并活动的权力。
During the subprime boom, large banks were more likely to want to expand, and thus had greater incentive to comply.	在次贷繁荣期，大银行更可能渴望扩张，因此由更大的激励执行CRA。
The study finds that CRA lending by larger banks does indeed respond more to a CRA examination.	研究发现，大银行的CRA贷款事实上对CRA检查反应更大。
At the height of the lending frenzy (2004-2006), the study finds that banks loaned even more in response to an examination, and that the outcomes were even worse.	在贷款疯（2004—2006年）高峰期，研究表明银行因检查而增加的贷款规模更大了，结果也更加糟糕。
The authors speculate that easier loan securitization may have made risky CRA-compliant loans seem less costly.	作者推测，贷款证券化更加容易可能是为执行CRA而发放的高风险贷款成本下降的原因。
Finally, like all good studies, this one explains why the authors more careful analysis produces results that differ from those in previous studies.	最后，与所有优秀研究一样，该研究解释了为何作者更仔细的研究产生了与此前研究不同的结果。
Because of the way it is structured, the study only suggests a lower bound on the effects of CRA compliance.	出于研究方法构造的原因，该研究只揭示了CRA执法效应存在下限。
It focuses on the differential impact of the CRA on banks undergoing examination and those not undergoing examination.	该研究的注意力集中在CRA对于接受检查和不接受检查��行的效应的差异。
In fact, all banks are likely to have upped their CRA-compliant lending.	事实上，可能所有银行都提高了它们的CRA贷款。
The study cannot measure this increase.	该研究并不能测量这一增量。
There is room in economics for grand speculation – some part intuition, some part common sense, and some part ideology.	经济学具有大胆猜测的空间 — — 一部分来自直觉，一部分来自常识，一部分来自意识形态。
If economists were to wait for careful studies before offering opinions about policy, we would never have anything timely to say.	如果经济学家等到仔细的研究出现之后再给出政策选择建议，我们就不可能及时发出任何声音。
And it is certainly better to have some economic intuition guiding policy than none at all.	显然，让一些经济直觉来指导政策比一刀切杜绝经济直觉好。
But there is a danger that the public mistakes speculation for truth, only because of the speculator’s credentials and assertiveness.	但存在公众将猜测和真相混淆的危险，而公众之所以会混淆，只是因为猜测者的资质和自信。
Studies like this one are useful in setting the record straight.	类似该研究的研究在让记录变得更直观方面很有用。
More broadly, the study suggests that we should move beyond blaming the bankers.	从更广的意义上说，该研究证明我们应该不再把矛头一股脑儿指向银行家。
We must recognize that in the desire to broaden home ownership, essential checks and balances broke down.	我们必须认识到，为了扩大房屋所有权，必要的检查和平衡被打破了。
Households, politicians, and regulators were also complicit.	家庭、政客和监管者都是同谋。
As we go about the process of reform, we should bear in mind that the only thing worse than fighting the last war is fighting the wrong last war.	我们即将进入改革程序，此时应该牢记，唯一比上一场战争更糟糕的事情是打了一场错误的上一场战争。
	
Why Border Walls Fail	为何边境墙会失败
HONOLULU – Call this the Year of Border Walls.	檀香山—今年可称之为边境墙之年。
In 2015, Estonia, Hungary, Kenya, Saudi Arabia, and Tunisia all announced or began the construction of barriers on their frontiers.	2015年，爱沙尼亚、匈牙利、肯尼亚、沙特阿拉伯博和突尼斯均宣布或开始沿国境线建设隔离屏障。
We may live in an era of globalization, but much of the world is increasingly focused on limiting the free movement of people.	我们也许生活在与一个全球化时代，但世界上很大一部分正日益着重于限制人们的自由迁徙。
At the end of World War II, there were only five border walls around the world.	第二次世界大战结束时，全世界只有五座边境墙。
Today, according to Elisabeth Vallet of the University of Quebec at Montreal, there are 65, three-quarters of them built in the past 20 years.	如今，根据魁北克大学蒙特利尔分校的伊丽莎白·瓦利特（Elisabeth Vallet）的数据，全球有65座边境墙，其中四分之三是在过去20年建设的。
And in the United States, Republican presidential candidates are promising more.	在美国，共和党总统候选人们承诺要建更多边境墙。
The Republican frontrunner, Donald Trump, has repeatedly proposed building a wall along the entire border with Mexico.	在共和党候选人竞争中领跑的唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）一再建议沿着墨西哥边境全线建立一座墙。
And on a Sunday morning talk show, another Republican candidate, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, described building a wall on the US-Canada border as “a legitimate issue for us to look at.”	在一次周日晨间脱口秀上，另一位共和党候选人、威斯康辛州州长斯科特·沃克尔（Scott Walker）称在加拿大边境建设一座边境墙是“一个我们看来相当合理的事项 ” 。
And yet existing border walls are neither cheap nor effective.	然而现有边境墙可谓事倍功半。
Israel’s wall in the West Bank cost more than $1 million per mile to construct.	以色列在约旦河西岸建立的边境墙每英里耗资超过一百万美元。
According to US Customs and Border Protection, building and maintaining the existing 670 miles of border fencing on the US-Mexico border would cost $6.5 billion over the barrier’s expected 20-year life cycle. At this price, fortifying the remaining 1,300 miles of the Mexico border would cost more than $12.6 billion.	据美国海关与边境保护局的数据，建设和维护现有670英里墨西哥边境隔离障将在隔离障设施20年的生命周期中耗费65亿美元。
Erecting a wall along the 5,525-mile border with Canada would cost almost $50 billion and would cut through an airport runway, an opera house, homes, and businesses that currently straddle the border.	照此推算，在剩余1,300英里墨西哥边境依样画葫芦的代价将超过126亿美元。
Nor is there much evidence that border walls work as intended.	也没有多少证据表明边境墙起到了初衷。
To be sure, prisons demonstrate that short, well-guarded walls can be extremely effective at preventing movement.	诚然，监狱证明了距离较短、看守完善的高墙在阻止人身移动方面非常有效。
But even prison walls are only as effective as the guards who ensure that they are not breached, and guards can be susceptible to bribes.	但即使是监狱高墙，也只有在看守保证它不出现漏洞时有效，而看守是可以贿赂的。
The recent escape of the drug cartel leader Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman from a Mexican prison highlights another vulnerability of border walls: tunnels.	最近，大毒枭“矮子”华金·古兹曼（Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman）从一间墨西哥监狱中越狱，凸显出边境墙的另一个弱点：地道。
Since 1990, the US Border Patrol has found 150 tunnels beneath the US-Mexico border.	1990年以来，美国边防局在美墨边境发现了150条地道。
Those with money will always be able to cross borders using fake documents, bribes, or innovative infrastructure.	只要有钱，就能用假证件、贿赂或创新方法越境。
Indeed, fortified frontiers are most effective at stopping poor migrants and refugees.	事实上，加强的边境阻挡的大多是贫穷的移民和难民。
And even then, rather than preventing migrants from entering, fortifications all too often funnel them toward more dangerous crossing points.	而即使是对贫穷的移民和难民，边防往往也不能阻止他们入境，而是驱使他们前往更加危险的越境点。
The result is a mounting toll of predictable deaths.	结果是可预见死亡人数越来越多。
The International Organization for Migration estimates that from 2005 to 2014, some 40,000 people died attempting to cross a border.	国际移民组织估算，从2005年到2014年，大约40,000人在试图穿越边境时丧生。
Unlike prison perimeters, borders can be thousands of miles long, which makes them difficult to monitor properly.	和监狱不同，边境可能长达数千英里，这意味着很难对其进行恰当的监控。
The US employs more than 20,000 Border Patrol agents; but even if they were all on duty at the same time, each would need to guard a 1,700-foot section of the border.	美国边防局雇用了20,000名雇员；但即使他们同时出勤，每人也需要看守1,700英尺长的边境线。
Of course, equipment like cameras, motion sensors, drones, helicopters, and vehicles allow agents to watch long sections of the border.	当然，摄像机、运动传感器、无人机、直升机和汽车使得边防人员能够监控相当长的边境线。
But the necessity of monitoring border walls points to one of the fundamental truths about them: historically, most have proved to be pretty useless.	但监控边境墙的必要性直指一个关于它们的基本事实：从历史上看，它们大多毫无用处。
The most famous sections of the Great Wall of China were overrun within a few decades of their construction.	最著名的是中国的长城，建成不过几十年就被穿越。
When Germany invaded France in WWII, it simply went around the Maginot Line.	二战中德国入侵法国时也轻松绕过了马奇诺防线。
The Berlin Wall fell within 30 years of its construction.	柏林墙也在建成后不出30年倒塌。
Indeed, border guards and their equipment can be equally effective without a physical barrier.	事实上，边境看守和他们的设备在没有实体隔离障的情况下同样有效。
At best, walls and fences only slow people down, making them a poor investment from a security standpoint.	高墙和藩篱充其量只能减缓人们越境的速度，这意味着从安全角度，建设边境墙是拙劣的投资。
They are similarly ineffective from a military perspective.	从军事角度，边境墙同样无效。
Missiles and airplanes can fly over them and tanks can smash through them.	导弹和飞机可以飞越它们，坦克可以碾过它们。
And yet, despite their high cost and low efficacy, walls remain popular among policymakers and politicians.	然而，尽管事倍功半，但高墙仍是决策者和政客的最爱。
They provide imposingly tangible evidence that something is being done about migration.	高墙可以提供铁证，证明他们为移民问题做了些什么。
High-tech surveillance and boots on the ground may be more effective at preventing people from crossing a border, but a wall can be used as a political prop.	高科技监控和荷枪实弹也许能更有效地阻止人们穿越边境，但高墙可以作为政治支撑。
If Trump ever builds his wall, he should build a really nice one, like the Great Wall of China.	如果特朗普真的建起了他的边境墙，那么应该会是一座相当漂亮的墙，就像中国的长城。
Then one day it might become a popular tourist attraction – and finally serve a useful purpose.	有一天它会变成热门旅游景点 — — 也算是终于找到了大用场。
	
Football Fury	足球狂怒
PARIS – Who would have thought it?	巴黎—有谁能想到？
There they were, Brazilians, protesting outside football stadiums against their country hosting the World Cup in 2014 – and this even as their national team was thrashing Spain in the final of the Confederations Cup.	他们，巴西人民，在足球场外抗议祖国举办2014年世界杯 — — 而与此同时，巴西国家足球队在联合会杯决赛上痛宰了西班牙队。
It was as if Catholics were to protest outside the Vatican against picking a new Pope.	这就好比是天主教徒在梵蒂冈外抗议选出新教皇。
What cuisine is to the French, soccer is to Brazilians: a matter of the highest national pride.	足球之于巴西，正如烹饪之于法国，乃国之瑰宝也。
Regardless of their economic, racial, or political differences, all Brazilians are uplifted by having the best team in the world, winning the World Cup many times, and inventing and reinventing “the beautiful game.”	不论他们经济、种族和政治上有什么差别，巴西人因为拥有世界最强足球队而自豪，他们赢得过多次世界杯，上演过一次又一次“完美比赛 ” 。
Staging the next World Cup in Brazil, as well as the Olympic Games in 2016, even though the football tournament alone will cost up to $13 billion, seems a logical move.	下一届世界杯和奥运会（2016年）都将在巴西举行，尽管光是世界杯就要花费130亿美元，但这再自然也没有了。
Rio de Janeiro is where soccer belongs.	里约热内卢是足球的家园。
So what possessed the 19-year-old Brazilian male who told reporters: “We don’t need the World Cup.	那么，是什么让19岁的巴西男子对记者说出“我们不需要世界杯。
We need education, better health services, more humane police.”	我们需要的是教育、更好的服务和更人性的政策 。 ” 这样惊世骇俗的话？
Many people feel the same way.	许多人都有同样的感觉。
Have millions of Brazilians suddenly lost their passion for the game?	难道数百万巴西人一夜之间失去了对足球运动的热情？
If so, it is not the game itself that they have forsaken, but rather the kind of game that football has become: a billion-dollar business, a prestige object for louche plutocrats, and an extravagant showpiece for corrupt governments and international sporting organizations.	果真如此的话，被他们所放弃的也不是足球运动本身，而是足球运动所变成的样子：一桩10亿美元的生意，富而不仁的显贵拿它来装点门面，沦为腐败的政府和国际运动组织的奢侈展示品。
Football was once a popular sport, rooted in local communities.	曾几何时，足球是一项植根于社区的大众运动。
Local working-class boys played for local clubs that inspired fierce loyalty among fans.	本地工人阶级男孩为本地俱乐部效力，本地俱乐部拥有非常忠诚的球迷群体。
Football chauvinism always contained an edge of violence, for it often included an ethnic, religious, or class component: Protestants versus Catholics (in Scotland); “Jewish” clubs (in Amsterdam, Berlin, London, and Budapest), taunted by fans who opposed the “Yids”; posh clubs (like Galatasaray in Istanbul) and resolutely proletarian sides (West Ham in London); clubs that took pride in a strong regional identity (Barcelona); and clubs that were close to the centers of power (Real Madrid).	足球沙文主义总是有着暴力之刃，因为它通常包括了种族、宗教和阶级元素：新教徒与天主教徒（在苏格兰 ） ； 被反对“犹太佬”的球迷奚落的“犹太”俱乐部（在阿姆斯特丹、柏林、伦敦和布达佩斯 ） ； 奢侈俱乐部（比如伊斯坦布尔的加拉塔萨雷）和纯粹的工人阶级俱乐部（伦敦的西汉姆 ） ； 以强烈的地区身份为傲的俱乐部（巴塞罗那 ） ； 以及接近权力中心的俱乐部（皇家马德里 ） 。
Some clubs were financed by industrial corporations in order to promote loyalty among their workers: Philips sponsored the Dutch club PSV Eindhoven, for example, while Fiat played the same role for Italy’s Juventus.	一些俱乐部受产业公司的财政支持，以赢得员工支持：比如，飞利浦公司赞助着荷兰俱乐部埃因霍温，菲亚特在意大利的尤文图斯也扮演着同样角色。
But, regardless of the sponsorship or the location, fans felt close to most of the clubs, as well as to their national teams.	但是，不管有没有赞助、位于何处，球迷与大部分俱乐部心心相印，对国家队亦然。
They were part of people’s “identity.”	它们是人们“身份”的一部分。
This is still true to some extent, but something crucial has changed: football, like other types of commerce, has gone global.	从某种程度上说，这一点仍然成立，但一些关键之处已经发生了变化：足球和其他种类的营生一样，已经走向了全球化。
Thanks to new ownership rules, cable television, product endorsements, and other business-related factors, there are probably more supporters of Manchester United in China than there are in the United Kingdom, let alone in the city of Manchester.	新的所有权规则、有线电视、产品代言和其他商业相关因素使得中国的曼联球迷可能比英国还多，更不用说曼彻斯特了。
Football teams are now like multinational franchises, with coaches and players from all over the world.	足球队现在就像是跨国特许精英企业，教练和队员都是全球遴选而得。
But this alone does not account for the kind of alienation from the game expressed by the Brazilian protesters.	但光是这一点无法解释巴西示威者对足球产生的疏离感。
The worldwide reach of football was preceded by that of the Olympic Games, and it is here where we should turn to understand the corruption of globalized sports.	论全球普及，足球不如奥运会，而在这方面，我们得回过头来理解一下全球化运动的腐败问题。
Unlike football, the Olympics were always closely associated with elites: amateur athletes recruited from universities, and so on.	与足球不同，奥运会始终与精英阶层紧密相连：从大学生中遴选出来的业余选手，如此等等。
The father of the modern Olympic Games, Baron de Courbertin, was a French aristocrat who promoted sports to reinvigorate the men of France after their defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1871.	奥运会之父顾拜旦是法国贵族，他推广体育是为了刺激法国人从1871年普法战争的失败中重新振作。
His aim for the Olympic Games was to embody a noble ideal of world peace and brotherhood through athletic competition.	他举办奥运会的目的是通过体育竞赛实现世界和平和四海之内皆兄弟的高尚理想。
How easily this ideal could be corrupted by distinctly ungentlemanly politics was already clear in 1936, when Coubertin’s doddering speech about peace and fair play was played over the loudspeakers of the Olympic Stadium in Berlin, while Hitler and his henchmen raised their arms to salute the Nazi flag.	这一理想极易被毫无优雅性可言的政治所腐蚀，1936年就是明证：老态龙钟的顾拜旦关于和平和公平竞赛的演讲通过扬声器飘荡在柏林奥林匹克体育场���空，而希特勒及其亲信朝纳粹旗帜敬礼。
But even without noisome politics, the sheer amount of money required to stage the Olympic Games – the building contracts for stadiums, transport infrastructure, and hotels, together with all the other commercial razzmatazz – was bound to produce a culture of bribery and kickbacks.	但即使没有臭不可闻的政治，举办奥运会所需要的巨资 — — 建造体育场的合同、交通基础设施、饭店，以及其他各种商业设施 — — 注定会滋生贿赂和回扣文化。
An international elite of Olympic officials arose, living in a self-contained bubble of wealth and privilege.	奥林匹克官员成了国际精英，他们生活在自成体系的财富和地位泡沫中。
I once had occasion to watch these men as they trooped in and out of first-class hotels in an Asian capital, sleek figures in gold-buttoned blazers.	我曾经在亚洲某国首都的一家顶级饭店中巧遇这些人，他们金履华服，风度翩翩。
It was striking to see how often the most prosperous-looking representatives came from the world’s poorest countries.	令人惊异的是，这些最优渥的代表往往来自世界最贫穷的国家。
Football is now like the Olympics (or Formula 1 racing), except that even more money is involved.	如今，足球就和奥运会（或一级方程式赛车）一模一样，除了它所涉及的钱更多之外。
Football clubs have become the status symbols of newly rich tycoons from Russia or the Middle East, and international competitions, especially the World Cup, have become occasions to bolster the prestige, and sometimes even the legitimacy, of national governments.	足球俱乐部已经成为俄罗斯和中东新富豪地位的象征，国际足球比赛，特别是世界杯，已经成为彰显国家政府地位甚至合法性的盛会。
Such events reinforce the tendency of modern political regimes, dictatorships as well as democracies, to measure themselves in monumental building projects – giant new stadiums, gargantuan shopping malls, huge conference halls – which are sometimes needed, but often are not.	这类盛会强化了现代政治体制 — — 不管是民主还是独裁 — — 建造不朽建筑工程的倾向（巨型的新体育场、庞大的购物中心、巨大的会议中心等 ） ， 有时这些建筑是有必要的，但通常并非如此。
As a result, developers, architects, politicians, tycoons, and international sporting officials are now in charge of the beautiful game.	结果，现如今开发商、建筑商、政客、富豪和国际体育官员主宰了完美比赛。
This adds to their power, wealth, and prestige.	这增加了他们的权势、财富和地位。
But once they have staged their spectacles, at vast expense to the host country, they move on.	但他们在康东道国之慨办了盛会后便拍拍屁股一走了之。
This is especially galling in countries where much of the population is poor and deprived of decent schools or proper medical services.	这让大量人口仍然处于贫困、无法接受体面教育和合适的医疗服务的国家尤其难堪。
Millions of Brazilians have made clear where their priorities lie.	数百万巴西人明确地表明了什么才是他们最先考虑的东西。
They haven’t fallen out of love with football.	他们并没有失去对足球的热爱。
On the contrary, by protesting against the grotesque manipulation of the modern game, they are trying to take it back.	相反，他们在通过抗议对现代足球运动的可笑操纵，试图让足球正本清源。
	
BRICS Without Mortar	没有泥浆的砖
CAMBRIDGE – Last month, China’s new president, Xi Jinping, chose Moscow for his first foreign visit.	美国剑桥—上个月，中国新国家主席习近平选择莫斯科为出国访问第一站。
He and Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a number of agreements and then traveled to Durban, South Africa, for the fifth “BRICS” summit, where they joined with the leaders of India, Brazil, and South Africa to announce the creation of a new development bank that could challenge the dominance of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.	他和俄罗斯总统普京商定了一系列协议，接着来到南非德班出席第五届“金砖国家”峰会，与印度、巴西和南非领导人宣布将成立能够对世界银行和IMF主导地位形成挑战的新开发银行。
The five leaders’ speeches referred to a shifting world order, and Xi said “the potential of BRICS development is infinite.”	五国领导人在讲话中提到了世界秩序的变迁，习近平表示“金砖国家发展潜力无穷 。 ”
It looked as if the BRICS had finally come of age.	看起来金砖国家终于成熟了。
Three years ago, I was skeptical about the BRICS. And, despite the recent summit’s apparent success, I still am.	三年前我对金砖国家持怀疑态度，现在亦然，尽管最新的峰会看上去颇为成功。
Nearly 12 years ago, Jim O’Neill, then the chief economist for Goldman Sachs, coined the term “BRIC” to describe the “emerging markets” of Brazil, Russia, India, and China.	近12年前，高盛首席经济学家奥尼尔（Jim O’Neil）创造了“金砖”一词描述巴西、俄罗斯、印度和中国四个“新兴市场 ” 。
From 2000 to 2008, these four countries’ share of global output rose rapidly, from 16% to 22% (in purchasing power parity terms), and their economies performed better than average in the subsequent global recession.	从2000年到2008年，这四个国家占全球产出比重大幅上升，从16%升至22 % （ 以购买力平价衡量 ） ， 在随后的全球衰退中，它们的经济表现也好于平均水平。
For investors, that outcome justified the creation of the catchy acronym.	对投资者来说，这一结果表明“金砖”一词名副其实。
But then a strange thing happened: the investors’ creature came to life.	但接下来发生了怪事：投资者的创造物开始活跃。
In 2009, the four countries met for the first time in Russia in an effort to forge an international political organization.	2009年，四国在俄罗斯首次举行会晤，试图打造一个国际政治组织。
South Africa joined the bloc in late 2010 primarily for political reasons.	南非在2010年末也加入其中，主要是出于政治考虑。
As O’Neill recently told China Daily, “South Africa is quite fortunate enough to be in the group, as, economically, it is rather small compared to the others.”	奥尼尔最近对《中国日报》表示 ： “ 南非加入金砖国家何其幸运，因为从经济上讲，它与其他四国相比规模相当小 。 ”
Moreover, its economic performance has been relatively sluggish, with a growth rate of just 2.3% last year.	此外，它的经济表现也相对萎靡，去年增长率只有2.3 % 。
Indeed, while the BRICS may be helpful in coordinating certain diplomatic tactics, the term lumps together highly disparate countries.	事实上，尽管金砖国家或许有助于协调某些外交策略，但这个词所指的五个国家之间情况大不相同。
Not only is South Africa miniscule compared to the others, but China’s economy is larger than those of all of the other members combined.	南非规模太小，而中国经济比其他四国加起来还要打。
Likewise, India, Brazil, and South Africa are democracies, and occasionally meet in an alternative forum that they call “IBSA.”	类似地，印度，巴西和南非是民主国家，有时候会以“IBSA”的名义搞小团体。
And, while the large autocracies, Russia and China, find it diplomatically advantageous to tweak the Americans, both have different but crucial relationships with the United States.	此外，专制大国俄罗斯和中国认为这有助于在外交上与美国角力，但两国各自与美国有着各不相同但至关重要的关系。
And both have worked to thwart efforts by India, Brazil, and South Africa to become permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.	两国也都在致力于阻挠印度、巴西和南非成为联合国安理会常任理事国。
As I wrote three years ago, in analytical terms, it makes little sense to include Russia, a former superpower, with the developing economies.	我在三年前指出，从分析角度讲，把昔日超级大国俄罗斯纳入金砖国家范围、与发展中国家为伍毫无必要。
Russia lacks diversified exports, faces severe demographic and health problems, and, in former President Dmitri Medvedev’s words, “greatly needs modernization.”	俄罗斯没有多样化的出口，面临着严峻的人口和卫生问题，用前总统梅德韦杰夫的话说，俄罗斯“急切地需要现代化 。 ”
Little has changed since Putin returned to the presidency last year.	自去年普京重回总统宝座以来，俄罗斯并没有发生多少变化。
While economic growth benefited from the dramatic growth in oil and gas prices during the last decade, other competitive industries have yet to emerge, and the country now faces the prospect of declining energy prices.	经济增长因过去十年的油价和气价飙升而获益良多，但除此之外便再无竞争力产业，而如今俄罗斯面临着能源价格下跌的前景。
While it aims to maintain 5% annual growth, its economy was relatively flat last year.	尽管俄罗斯仍维持着5%的年经济增长，但去年其经济表现相对较为沉寂。
If Russia’s power resources seem to be declining, Brazil’s appear to be more impressive, given it has a territory nearly three times the size of India’s, a 90% literacy rate, and triple the per capita income of India (and nearly twice that of China).	如果说俄罗斯实力源泉在告竭，那么巴西可谓令人印象深刻，其国土几为印度的三倍，识字率高达90 % ， 人均收入也是印度的三倍（和中国的近两倍 ） 。
But, in the three years since my earlier assessment, Brazil’s performance has slipped: annual economic growth has slowed from 7.5% in 2010 to 1% last year, with a 3.5% rate expected in 2013.	但是，在我的早先评估做出三年后，巴西的表现有所滑坡：经济增长从2010年的7.5%降至去年的1 % ， 2013年预计也只有3.5 % 。
Like Brazil, India experienced a spurt of output growth after liberalizing its economy in the 1990’s; indeed, until a few years ago, GDP growth was approaching Chinese-style rates.	与巴西相同，印度在20世纪经济自由化之后出现了产出井喷；事实上，前些年印度GDP增长堪与中国媲美。
This year, however, output is expected to rise by a relatively sluggish 5.9%.	但是，今年产出增长预计将相对缓慢，只有5.9 % 。
Unless it improves its infrastructure and literacy rate (particularly for women), India is unlikely to catch up with China.	除非印度改善其基础设施和识字率（特别是女性识字率 ） ， 否则绝无可能赶超中国。
So, should we take today’s BRICS more seriously than the BRICs of three years ago?	因此，今天的金砖国家比三年前的金砖四国更值得关注吗？
Tellingly, the meeting in Durban failed to produce any details of the structure of the proposed new development bank, suggesting that little progress had been made in the year since the BRICS’ last meeting in New Delhi, where the plan was announced.	显然，德班会晤并没有就建议中的新开发银行的细节和结构给出多少信息，这表明自上届新德里会晤以来，在这方面并未取得多少进展（开发银行的计划正是在新德里提出的 ） 。
In fact, despite a commitment to launch “formal negotiations” to establish the bank, disagreements about the size and shares of the bank’s capital have not been resolved.	事实上，尽管做出了就成立新开发银行展开“正式谈判”的承诺，但该银行的规模和出资份额等问题仍有待解决。
That lack of unity is symptomatic of the BRICS members’ underlying incompatibilities.	如此缺少统一其实是金砖国家内在不协调的表征。
In political terms, China, India, and Russia are vying with each other for power in Asia.	从政治上讲，中国、印度和俄罗斯是亚洲领导权的竞争对手。
And, in economic terms, Brazil, India, and South Africa are concerned about the effects of China’s undervalued currency on their economies.	从经济上讲，巴西、印度和南非都担心人民币低估对各自经济的影响。
Three years ago, I wrote that, “BRIC is not likely to become a serious political organization of like-minded states.”	三年前我写道 ， “ 金砖四国不可能形成由观念一致的国家组成的政治组织 。 ”
The BRICS’ most recent meeting has given me no reason to revise that assessment.	金砖国家的最新会晤并没有让我觉得有必要修正这一论断。
	
Why Capital Flows Uphill	资金为什么会往高处流
LONDON – At first, it seems difficult to grasp: global capital is flowing from poor to rich countries.	伦敦 — — 起初似乎很难理解全球资本为什么会从穷国倒流向富国。
Emerging-market countries run current-account surpluses, while advanced economies have deficits.	新兴市场国家普遍录得经常账户盈余，而发达经济体则录得赤字。
One would expect fast-growing, capital-scarce (and young) developing countries to be importing capital from the rest of world to finance consumption and investment.	年轻的发展中国家增长速度快，资本匮乏，按常理他们本该从其他国家进口资金以支持金融消费和投资。
So, why are they sending capital to richer countries, instead?	那么为什么事实却恰恰相反，他们在向富裕国家进行资本输出？
China is a case in point.	中国就是一个很好的例子。
With its current-account surplus averaging 5.5% of GDP in 2000-2008, China has become one of the world’s largest lenders.	中国的经常账户盈余在2000－2008年间平均达到5.5 % ， 已经成为全世界最大的贷款国之一。
Despite its rapid growth and promising investment opportunities, the country has persistently been sending a significant portion of its savings overseas.	尽管投资机会诱人、经济也快速成长，中国却一直将很大一部分储蓄向海外输出。
And China is not alone.	中国的情况并非个例。
Other emerging markets – including Brazil, Russia, India, Mexico, Argentina, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Middle Eastern oil exporters – have all increased their current-account surpluses significantly since the early 1990’s.	包括巴西、俄罗斯、印度、墨西哥、阿根廷、泰国、印尼、马来西亚和中东石油出口国在内的其他新兴市场经常账户盈余自20世纪90年代初起就显著增加。
Collectively, capital-scarce developing countries are lending to capital-abundant advanced economies.	资金匮乏的发展中国家向资金充裕的发达国家放贷成为一种集体现象。
Many observers believe that these global imbalances reflect developing economies’ financial integration, coupled with underdevelopment of domestic financial markets.	很多观察家认为这样的全球失衡反映了发展中国家金融一体化的现状，以及国内金融市场还很不成熟。
According to this view, these countries’ demand for assets cannot be met – in terms of both quantity and quality – at home, so they deploy part of their savings to countries like the US, which can offer a more diverse array of quality assets.	按照此类说法，这些国家对资产的需求（无论从数量还是质量上）都无法在国内得到满足，因此他们只得将部分储蓄配置到以美国为首的国家，因为这些国家拥有更多样化的优质资产可供选择。
While plausible, this argument suggests that, as financial markets improve over time in developing countries, the global imbalances are bound to shrink.	这种说法虽然有一定道理，但人们因此可以顺理成章地认为随着发展中国家金融市场的逐步发展，全球失衡的现象必然日渐萎缩。
But such a reversal is nowhere in sight.	但这样的逆转似乎还遥遥无期。
Why?	这又是什么原因呢？
A crucial dimension of globalization has been trade liberalization.	全球化的一个重要方面是贸易自由化。
For China, foreign trade as a percentage of GDP soared from 25% in 1989 to 66% in 2006, largely owing to its admission to the World Trade Organization in 2001.	对中国而言，由于在2001年加入世贸组织，外贸占其国内生产总值的比重从1989年的25%猛增至2006年的66 % 。
Most of what China and other developing countries produce and export are labor-intensive goods such as textiles and apparel.	中国和其他发展中国家生产出口的多数是劳动密集型产品，如纺织品和服装。
This has allowed advanced economies, in turn, to produce and export more capital-intensive, higher-value-added products.	发达国家则反过来得以从事资本更密集、附加值更高的生产活动。
Globalization of trade enabled countries to tap the efficiency gains that specialization in their sectors of comparative advantage has brought about.	贸易全球化使各国能充分利用专注于比较优势领域所带来的效率回报。
With a slight mental stretch, one can imagine that what a country produces and trades may affect its savings and investment decisions.	稍微发挥一下想象力就不难想见，一个国家的产品和贸易可能会影响其储蓄和投资决策。
An economy in which the main productive activity is berry picking, for example, has little need for investment and capital accumulation.	比方说，一个以浆果采摘为主要生产活动的经济体将鲜有投资和资本积累的需求。
Its laborers earn wages, consume, and save part of that income.	那里的劳动者挣钱、消费，并储存部分劳动收入。
Since the production process requires little capital, there is no demand for domestic investment – and thus no savings vehicles.	因为简单的生产过程不需要多少资金，国内的投资需求比较匮乏 — — 因此也没有多少储蓄工具可供选择。
Instead, the only way to save is by purchasing capital abroad – in economies with capital-intensive production and demand for investment.	相反，唯一的储蓄方法是向从事资本密集型生产并有投资需求的国家购买外国资本。
This economy will always export its savings.	这样的国家总会将储蓄出口。
That may be an extreme example, but it illustrates a more general point about how merchandise trade can influence financial flows.	这或许是个极端的例子，但却足以证明贸易影响资金流动的普遍原则。
Countries that produce and export more labor-intensive goods – perhaps owing to increased trade openness, or faster labor-force and productivity growth, all of which are true of China – may experience a rise in saving, but a less-than-equivalent increase in demand for capital.	像中国这样生产及出口劳动密集型产品的国家可能因为贸易开放或劳动力及生产率快速增长而出现储蓄增长，但是对资金的需求却相对匮乏。
Rich countries, by contrast, are able to export more capital-intensive goods, and thus have a greater need for investment.	相反，富国则可以出口资本更为密集的产品，因此拥有更为强劲的投资需求。
So they may be importing more capital – resulting in a greater current-account deficit – simply because they are producing more capital-intensive goods.	于是他们可能仅仅因为生产资本密集型产品而要进口更多的资金 — — 从而导致经常账户赤字的增加。
With developing countries – in particular, China, India, and the ex-Soviet bloc – bringing almost 1.5 billion workers into the world economy since the early 1990’s, it is not difficult to understand the potential impact of this effect.	因为中国、印度、前苏联等发展中国家从20世纪90年代初起即携带近15亿劳动力融入世界经济，上述效应所产生的潜在影响力并不难想象。
After all, much of this labor force was absorbed by labor-intensive industries that eventually churned out products exported to the rest of the world.	毕竟其中多数人被劳动力密集型行业所吸收，批量制造出各种产品出口到世界各国。
Indeed, that massive addition of labor helped to drive down the relative price of labor-intensive goods, which fell by roughly 15% between 1989 and 2008.	事实上，这些大幅增加的劳动力压低了劳动力密集型产品的相对价格，该类产品从1989到2008年间价格降低了约15 % 。
As developing countries increased their labor-intensive production and exports, their current-account surpluses rose – by almost 3.6 percentage points, on average, between 1989-1993 and 2002-2006.	1989-1993及2002-2006年间，随着发展中国家加大劳动密集型产品的生产及出口，他们的经常账户盈余平均增长了近3.6 % 。
China’s current-account surplus increased by almost 11 percentage points over the same period, India’s by 2.5 percentage points, and Russia’s by seven percentage points.	中国同期内经常账户盈余增长近11 % ， 印度增长2.5 % ， 而俄罗斯则增长7 % 。
These countries, as well as other large surplus economies, such as Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and Iran, all experienced a simultaneous increase in the labor content of exports.	上述国家及巴西、沙特、伊朗等其他大规模盈余经济体均出现了出口产品劳动力含量同步增长的势头。
This pattern contrasts with that of the United States and many other advanced countries, which have experienced a deterioration of their current-account balances as their production and exports have become more capital-intensive.	美国和其他很多发达国家的模式则恰好相反，随着其国内生产及出口资本密集度的提升，他们的经常账户余额均出现了恶化。
Many might doubt the view that China is exporting more labor-intensive goods, rather than upgrading its exports on the capital- and skill-intensity ladder.	中国仍在出口更多劳动密集型产品，而不是提高其出口产品资金和技术密度的说法可能遭致很多人的怀疑。
But trade data suggest the opposite, perhaps because China’s accession to the WTO led to tariff reductions that released more labor-intensive production.	但贸易数据的显示却恰恰相反，可能因为中国加入WTO所导致的关税下降释放了劳动密集型产业。
In fact, trade data may underestimate the true extent of China’s labor intensity andoverstate the capital and skill intensity of China’s exports.	事实上，贸易数据可能低估中国真实的劳动力密集度，同时高估资本和技术密集度。
China has witnessed rapid growth in the processing trade: assembling intermediate inputs – imported from countries like the US and Japan – that have high capital and skill content.	中国经历了加工贸易的飞速发展：组装从美日等国进口的中间零件，这里所说的中间零件本身具有较高的资金及技术含量。
So, while the exports of these final goods may count towards China’s own capital and skill content, the country’s real role was only in the labor-intensive process of assembly.	因此，虽然上述最终产品的出口可能被算做中国自身的资金和技术含量，但劳动密集型的组装过程才是这个国家所扮演的真正角色。
A country’s production structure may very well determine how much capital it supplies and how much it needs.	一个国家的生产结构完全可以决定它所需求和供应的资金数额。
So the fact that capital may flow towards rich countries that produce and export more capital-intensive goods should not be so puzzling, after all.	因此归根结底，资金流向生产并出口资金密集型产品的富有国家并没有什么值得大惊小怪的。
	
Why China Can’t Adjust	为什么中国无法调整
CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA – China’s current economic slowdown has no shortage of causes: Europe’s financial turmoil, sputtering recovery in the United States, and weak domestic investment growth, to name the most commonly cited factors.	加州克莱蒙特—中国近期的经济减速原因很多：谈得最多的有欧洲金融动荡、美国复苏萎靡、国内投资增长不振等等。
Since exports and investment account, respectively, for 30% and 40% of China’s GDP growth, its economy is particularly vulnerable to weakening external demand and accumulation of non-performing loans caused by excessive and wasteful spending on fixed assets.	出口和投资分别贡献了中国GDP增长的30%和40 % ， 因此中国经济极易受到外需不振和固定资产开支过度和浪费导致的不良贷款积累的冲击。
But China’s vulnerability to these factors, as serious as they are, is symptomatic of deeper institutional problems.	但中国对这些因素如此脆弱只不过是深层次制度问题的表征。
Until these underlying constraints are addressed, talk of a new consumption-based growth model for China, reflected in the government’s recently approved 12th Five-Year Plan, can be no more than lip service.	除非其基础性约束得到修正，否则关于基于消费的增长模式的说法 — — 见于中国政府最新的十二五规划中 — — 就只能是空谈。
After all, China’s major trading partners, international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and senior Chinese officials themselves have long recognized the structural vulnerabilities caused by excessive investment and low household consumption.	毕竟，中国的主要贸易伙伴、国际金融机构（如世界银行和IMF）以及中国高级官员本身早就知道投资过度和家庭消费不足导致了结构性脆弱性。
And, for nearly a decade, China has been urged to undertake reforms to redress these economic patterns, which have undermined the welfare of ordinary Chinese and strained the global trading system.	近十年来，中国一直迫切地采取改革矫正其经济模式，而这拖累了普通中国百姓的福利，也束缚了全球贸易体系。
The best-known feature of China’s macroeconomic imbalances is heavy dependence on exports for growth, which is typically attributed to weak domestic demand: as a middle-income country, China lacks the purchasing power to consume the goods that it produces.	在中国的宏观失衡中，最著名的便是对出口提振增长的严重依赖，而这通常被归因于内需萎靡：作为中等收入国家，中国缺少消费它所生产的产品的购买力。
With nearly unlimited access to advanced-country markets, China can tap into global external demand and raise its GDP growth potential, as it has done for the past two decades.	中国基本上可以毫无限制地进入发达国家市场，因此可以充分利用全球外需并提升其GDP增长潜力，这正是中国过去二十年来做法。
If this view is right, the solution is straightforward: China can correct its imbalances by increasing its citizens’ incomes (by cutting taxes, raising wages, or increasing social spending), so that they can consume more, thereby reducing the economy’s dependence on exports.	如果这一观点正确，那么解决办法相当简单：中国可以通过增加人民收入（通过减税、增加工资和社会支出实现）纠正失衡，从而增加消费，从而降低经济对出口的依赖度。
Indeed, nearly all mainstream economists prescribe this approach for China.	事实上，几乎所有主流经济学家都给中国开出了这一药方。
But there is another explanation for China’s excessive export dependence, one that has more to do with the country’s poor political and economic institutions.	但对中国过度依赖出口的现象还有另一个解释，即这与中国政治和经济制度缺陷有关。
Specifically, export dependence partly reflects the high degree of difficulty of doing business in China.	具体来说，出口依赖部分反映了在中国做生意的高难度。
Official corruption, insecure property rights, stifling regulatory restraints, weak payment discipline, poor logistics and distribution, widespread counterfeiting, and vulnerability to other forms of intellectual-property theft: all of these obstacles increase transaction costs and make it difficult for entrepreneurs to thrive in domestic markets.	官员腐败、产权保护不力、令人窒息的监管约束、疲软的付款纪律、薄弱的物流和分配、遍地开花的假货，还有各种各样的知识产权侵权：所有这些障碍增加了交易成本，令企业家很难在国内市场上立足。
By contrast, if China’s private firms sell to Western multinationals, such as Wal-Mart, Target, or Home Depot, they do not have to worry about getting paid.	与此形成对比的是，如果中国民营企业把东西卖给沃尔玛、塔吉特（Target ） 、 家得宝（Home Depot）这样的西方跨国公司根本不用担心收不回货款。
They can avoid all of the headaches that they would have encountered at home, because well-established economic institutions and business practices in their export markets protect their interests and greatly reduce transaction costs.	他们可以避免在国内做生意时会遇到的所有问题，因为出口市场所具备的成熟经济制度和商业行为保护了他们的利益，显著地降低了交易成本。
The Chinese economy’s institutional weakness is reflected in international survey data.	中国经济的制度缺陷反映于国际调查数据中。
The World Bank publishes an annual review of “the ease of doing business” for 183 countries and sub-national units.	世界银行出版有关于“商业活动容易度”的年度报告，报告覆盖了183个国家和地区单元。
In its June 2011 survey, China was ranked 91st, behind Mongolia, Albania, and Belarus.	在2011年6月的调查中，中国排名第91位，次于蒙古、阿尔巴尼亚和白俄罗斯。
It is particularly difficult to start a business in China (151st), pay taxes (122nd), obtain construction permits (179th), and get electricity (115th).	在中国，开办企业（排名第151 ） 、 纳税（派排名第122 ） 、 获得建筑许可（排名第179 ） 、 获得电力（排名第115）尤其困难。
Faced with such a hostile environment, Chinese private entrepreneurs have been forced to engage in “institutional arbitrage” – taking advantage of efficient Western economic institutions to expand their business (most export-oriented businesses are owned by private entrepreneurs and foreign firms).	面临如此困难的环境，中国民营企业家被迫进行“制度套利 ” — —利用高校的西方经济制度扩张业务（大部分出口导向企业为民营企业家和外国公司所有 ） 。
Unfortunately, as China has already claimed a large share of the world’s merchandise exports (10.4% in 2010) and economic stagnation in the West is constraining external demand, this strategy can no longer work.	不幸的是，由于中国已经在世界货物出口中占据很大比重（2004年为10.4 % ） ，同时西方经济停滞又束缚着外部需求，出口导向战略难再奏效。
But reorienting their businesses toward the Chinese domestic market requires far more than government policies that put more money in consumers' pockets.	但把业务导向转向中国国内市场需要政府采取措施让消费者的腰包鼓起来。
In order to enjoy the same low transaction costs that they have in exporting, China’s entrepreneurs need a much better business environment: an effective legal system, a sound regulatory framework, a government that protects their brands by fighting intellectual-property theft, dependable logistics and distribution networks, and a graft-resistant bureaucracy.	为了享受到与出口业务相同的低交易成本，中国企业家需要更好的商业环境：高效的法律制度、有效的监管框架、通过消灭产权侵权保护品牌的政府、可靠的物流和分销网络以及清廉的官僚体系。
China cannot create such an environment quickly.	中国不可能很快地建立起这样的环境。
In essence, the Chinese government must transform a predatory state into a nurturing one, and treat private entrepreneurs as creators of wealth rather than targets of extraction.	从根本上说，中国政府需要从掠夺者转型为哺育者，将民营企业家视为财富创造者而不是榨取对象。
In nearly all other countries, such a transformation was accomplished by establishing the rule of law and/or moving from autocracy to democracy.	几乎在所有其他国家，这样的转型都伴随着建立法治精神和/或由独裁转向民主。
The impossibility of sustaining growth in the absence of the rule of law and political accountability presents the Chinese Communist Party with an existential dilemma.	没有法治精神和政治问责，就不可能维持增长，这让中国共产党陷入了存在性难题。
Ever since it crushed the pro-democracy movement in Tiananmen Square in 1989, the party has vowed not to surrender its political monopoly.	自从1989年在天安门广场镇压了民主运动之后，中共便一直紧抓政治垄断权不放。
The investment boom and the globalization dividend of the last two decades allowed the Party to have its cake and eat it – maintaining its rule on the basis of economic prosperity, while failing to establish the institutions critical to sustaining such prosperity.	过去20年的投资繁荣和全球化红利令中共鱼与熊掌兼得 — — 在经济繁荣的基础上保持着执政权，但中共并没有建立起维持繁荣所必须的制度。
Today, this is no longer possible.	如今，繁荣已不可再持续了。
So in a sense, the Chinese bubble – as much an intellectual and political bubble as an economic one – has burst.	因此，从某种程度上说，中国泡沫 — — 智识上、政治上、经济上的泡沫 — — 已经破灭了。
As China’s economic deceleration exposes its structural vulnerabilities and flawed policies, the much-hyped notion of “Chinese exceptionalism” – that China can continue to grow without the rule of law and the other essential institutions that a modern market economy presupposes – is proving to be nothing but a delusion.	随着中国经济的减速暴露了其结构性脆弱性和政策缺陷，如日中天的“中国例外”论 — — 中国可以在不追求法治精神和其他作为市场经济先决条件的关键制度的情况下继续增长 — — 正在露出幻象本质。
	
The Lessons of the China-India War	中印战争的经验教训
NEW DELHI – This month marks the 50th anniversary of China’s military attack on India, the only foreign war that communist-ruled China has won.	发自新德里 — — 本月是中国对印度发起军事行动五十年的日子，这场战争是共产党领导下的中国所赢的唯一一场对外战争。
Yet that war failed to resolve the disputes between the world’s two most populous countries, and its legacy continues to weigh down the bilateral relationship.	但这场战争却未能解决世界上人口最多的两个国家之间的争端，而其后果至今仍在拖累着双边关系。
While their economic heft is drawing increasing international attention, their underlying strategic rivalry over issues ranging from land and water to geopolitical influence in other regions usually attracts less notice.	当两国的经济实力正得到越来越多的国际关注之时，相对而言中印之间在其他问题上 — — 从土地到水源，再到对其他区域的地缘政治影响 — — 所存在的潜在战略对峙得到的关注就较少了。
The international importance of the China-India relationship reflects the fact that together they account for 37% of humanity.	中印关系在国际上的重要性反映了一个事实 — — 两国人口加起来占了全球人口的37 % 。
Although they represent markedly different cultures and competing models of development, they share a historical similarity that helps shape both countries’ diplomacy: each freed itself from colonial powers around the same time.	尽管他们代表着截然不同的文化以及相互竞争的发展模式，两国之间仍有着塑造了本国外交政策的相似历史：它们都在几乎同一时期将自身从殖民统治中解放了出来。
Throughout their histories, the Indian and Chinese civilizations were separated by the vast Tibetan plateau, limiting their interaction to sporadic cultural and religious contacts; political relations were absent.	纵观其历史，由于印度和中国的文明被广阔的青藏高原隔开，相互之间的文化和宗教互动因而受到了限制；而两国之间几乎不存在政治关系。
It was only after China’s annexation of Tibet in 1950-1951 that Han Chinese troops appeared for the first time on India’s Himalayan frontiers.	直到1950-1951年中国吞并了西藏之后，中国的汉族军队才第一次出现在喜马拉雅山的印度边境上。
Just over a decade later, China surprised India’s ill-prepared army by launching a multi-pronged attack across the Himalayas on October 20, 1962.	仅仅十余年后，1962年10月20日中国越过喜马拉雅山发动了令印度军队措手不及的全面进攻。
Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai publicly said that the war was intended “to teach India a lesson.”	中国总理周恩来公开宣称此次战争的目的是要给印度“一个教训 ” 。
Taking an enemy by surprise confers a significant tactical advantage in war, and the invasion inflicted an immense psychological and political shock on India that greatly magnified the initial military advances that China achieved.	意外的袭击使中国在战争中获得显著的战略优势，入侵给印度造成了巨大的心理及政治打击，从而夸大了中国最初所取得的军事进展。
China’s blitzkrieg created a defeatist mindset in India, forcing its army to retreat to defensive positions.	这种“闪电战”引发了印度人的失败主义心态，从而使得印度的军队后退到防守位置。
India, fearing unknown consequences, even shied away from employing its air power, although the Chinese military lacked effective air cover for its advancing forces.	出于对未知后果的恐惧，即便在中国先头部队缺乏有效空中掩护的情况下，印度依然放弃使用空军力量。
After more than a month of fighting, China declared a unilateral ceasefire from a position of strength, having seized Indian territory.	在战斗进行一个多月后，占领了印度领土的中国以强者姿态宣布单方面停火。
The Chinese simultaneously announced that they would begin withdrawing their forces on December 1, 1962, vacating their territorial gains in the eastern sector (where the borders of India, Myanmar, Tibet, and Bhutan converge) but retaining the areas seized in the western sector (in the original princely state of Jammu and Kashmir).	中国同时宣布将从1962年12月1日起开始撤军，并让出其在东部（即印度、缅甸、西藏和不丹交界区域）所占领的土地，但保留对西部（查谟和克什米尔）的占领。
These withdrawal parameters meshed with China’s pre-war aims.	这些撤军行动与中国战前所订立的目标是吻合的。
Just as Mao Zedong started his invasion of Tibet while the world was preoccupied with the Korean War, so he chose a perfect time to invade India, as recommended by the ancient strategist Sun Tzu.	正如中国古代军事家孙子所建议的一样，毛泽东选择在全世界都关注朝鲜战争时吞并西藏，同样他也选择了一个完美的时机入侵印度。
The attack coincided with a major international crisis that brought the United States and the Soviet Union within a whisker of nuclear war over the stealthy deployment of Soviet missiles in Cuba.	当袭击发生的时候，正好发生了一个重要的国际危机。 由于苏联在古巴秘密部署苏联导弹，美苏两国差点爆发核战。
China’s unilateral ceasefire coincided with America’s formal termination of its naval blockade of Cuba, marking the end of the missile crisis.	中国宣布单边停火时，美国也刚好正式终止对古巴的海上封锁，从而结束了导弹危机。
Mao’s shrewd timing ensured India’s isolation from sources of international support.	毛泽东所选择的时机确保了印度无法得到国际力量的支持。
Throughout the invasion, the international spotlight was on the potential US-Soviet nuclear showdown, not on the bloody war raging in the Himalayan foothills.	在中国入侵印度的整个过程中，国际关注点一直都放在有可能爆发的美苏核决战上，而不是喜马拉雅山山脚下的血腥鏖战。
India’s humiliating rout hastened the death of its prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru; but it also set in motion the country’s military modernization and political rise.	印度的耻辱溃败加速了其总理贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁（Jawaharlal Nehru）的死亡，但它也促进了这个国家的军事现代化和政治崛起。
Fifty years later, tensions between India and China are rising again amid an intense geopolitical rivalry.	50年后的今天，中印两国的紧张关系在一场激烈的地缘政治较量中再次加剧。
Their entire 4,057-kilometer border – one of the longest in the world – remains in dispute, without a clearly defined line of control in the Himalayas.	中印之间长达4057公里的边界（世界上最长的边界之一）仍处于争议之中，喜马拉雅山上也没有明确划定的控制线存在。
This situation has persisted despite regular Chinese-Indian talks since 1981.	尽管自1981年以来中印两国定期举行会谈，但这种形势从未改变。
In fact, these talks constitute the longest and most futile negotiating process between any two countries in modern history.	事实上，这些会谈在现代历史上可谓是国家之间最长且最无效的谈判。
During a 2010 visit to New Delhi, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao stated bluntly that sorting out the border disputes “will take a fairly long period of time.”	在2010年访问新德里期间，中国总理温家宝坦率地说要解决边境争端“需要相当长的一段时间 ” 。
If so, what does China (or India) gain by continuing the negotiations?	如果真是如此，中国（或印度）继续这些谈下去还有什么意义呢？
As old wounds fester, new issues have begun roiling bilateral relations.	过去的争议仍在恶化，又出现了扰乱双边关系的新问题。
For example, since 2006 China has initiated a new territorial dispute by claiming the eastern sector (the Austria-size Arunachal Pradesh state), from which its forces withdrew in 1962, describing it as “Southern Tibet.”	比如，自2006年起中国挑起了一场新的领土争端，它声称东部地区（面积近似奥地利的阿鲁纳恰尔邦）为其领土 — — 1962年中国军队从该地撤军并称之为“藏南 ” 。
A perceptible hardening of China’s stance toward India since then is also reflected in other developments, including Chinese strategic projects and the country’s military presence in the Pakistani-held portion of Kashmir, a region where the disputed borders of India, China, and Pakistan converge.	自从那时起中国对印度的明显强硬姿态还体现在其他事态的发展上，比如中国的战略项目以及该国在巴基斯坦控制克什米尔地区的军事存在 — — 该地是印度、中国和巴基斯坦三国交界的争议地区。
Indian defense officials have reported increased military incursions by Chinese troops in recent years.	印度的国防官员报告说中国军队的军事进犯不断增加。
In response, India has been beefing up its military deployments along the border to prevent any Chinese land grab.	对此印度已经开始加强边境军事部署以防中国蚕食。
It has also launched a crash program to improve its logistical capabilities by constructing new roads, airstrips, and advanced landing stations along the Himalayas.	同时它也启动了一���紧急方案，通过沿喜马拉雅山修建新的公路，飞机跑道和先进的起降平台来提高其后勤能力。
The larger strategic rivalry between the world’s largest autocracy and its biggest democracy has also sharpened, despite their fast-rising trade.	虽然两国贸易额迅速上升，世界上最大独裁国家和最大民主国家之间更大规模的军事战略较量也变得更为尖锐了。
In the past decade, bilateral trade has risen more than 20-fold, to $73.9 billion, making it the only area in which bilateral relations have thrived.	在过去十年中，双边贸易量已经上升了20倍，达到739亿美元，使其成为唯一一个双边关系蓬勃发展的领域。
Far from helping to turn the page on old disputes, this commerce has been accompanied by greater Sino-Indian geopolitical rivalry and military tension.	这种交往根本无助于两国翻过历史上有争议的一页，相反却伴随着越来严重的中印地缘竞争和军事紧张关系。
Booming bilateral trade is no guarantee of moderation between countries.	发展双边贸易并不能保证两国双边关系能有所缓和。
Although China set out to teach India a “lesson,” the 1962 war failed to achieve any lasting political objectives and only embittered bilateral relations.	虽然中国打算给印度一个“教训 ” ， 但中国在1962年的战争并未实现什么长久的政治目标，只是损害了两国的双边关系。
The same lesson is applicable to the Sino-Vietnamese context: In 1979, China replicated the 1962 model by launching a surprise blitzkrieg against Vietnam that Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping admitted was designed to “teach a lesson.”	这种教训也适用于中越两国：1979年，中国重施故技，突袭越南。 中国领导人邓小平承认这一袭击就是要给越南“一个教训 ” 。
After 29 days, China ended its invasion, claiming that Vietnam had been sufficiently chastised. But the lesson that Deng seems to have drawn from the PLA’s poor performance against Vietnam is that China, like India, needed to modernize every aspect of its society.	29天之后，中国结束了它的侵略，宣称越南已经遭到了充分地惩罚。 但似乎邓小平从中国人民解放军对越作战的恶劣表现中所得到的教训却是 — — 中国，跟印度一样，需要在其社会的各个方面都实现现代化。
	
China is Not Collapsing	中国没有在崩溃
LONDON – One question has dominated the International Monetary Fund’s annual meeting this year in Peru: Will China’s economic downturn trigger a new financial crisis just as the world is putting the last one to bed?	伦敦—一个问题主导了今年国际货币基金组织（IMF）的秘鲁年会：世界刚刚把上一场金融危机平息下去，中国经济减速会引发一场新的金融危机吗？
But the assumption underlying that question – that China is now the global economy’s weakest link – is highly suspect.	但这一问题背后的假设 — — 中国是目前全球经济最弱的一环 — — 颇可商榷。
China certainly experienced a turbulent summer, owing to three factors: economic weakness, financial panic, and the policy response to these problems.	显然，中国经历了一个动荡之夏，原因有三：经济疲软、金融恐慌以及对这些问题的政策应对。
While none on its own would have threatened the world economy, the danger stemmed from a self-reinforcing interaction among them: weak economic data leads to financial turmoil, which induces policy blunders that in turn fuel more financial panic, economic weakness, and policy mistakes.	这些问题中的每一个都不会威胁到世界经济，但危险源自这三个问题自我加强的互动：疲软的经济数据导致金融动荡，金融动荡导致政策错误，政策错误反过来助长更多的金融恐慌、经济疲软和政策错误。
Such self-reinforcing financial feedback is much more powerful in transmitting global economic contagion than ordinary commercial or trade exposures, as the world learned in 2008-2009.	这一自我加强的金融反馈对于传播全球经济传染病的效力远远大于常规商业或贸易风险暴露，2008—2009年的经验已经说明了这一点。
The question now is whether the vicious circle that began in China over the summer will continue.	现在的问题是，整个夏天始于中国的恶性循环是否会持续下去。
A sensible answer must distinguish between financial perceptions and economic reality.	明智的答案必须区分金融感觉和经济现实。
China’s growth slowdown is not in itself surprising or alarming.	中国的增长减速本身并不令人惊奇或值得警惕。
As the IMF noted, China’s growth rate has been declining steadily for five years – from 10.6% in 2010 to a projected rate of 6.8% this year and 6.3% in 2016.	IMF指出，中国增长率稳步下降已有五年 — — 从2010年的10.6%下降到今年6.8%和2016年6.3%的预计值。
This deceleration was inevitable as China advanced from extreme poverty and technological backwardness to become a middle-income economy powered by external trade and consumer spending.	这一减速是难以避免的，因为中国已经从极端贫困和科技落后中走出，成为受对外贸易和消费支出驱动的中等收入经济体。
It was also desirable, because rapid growth was hitting environmental limits.	这一减速也是合适的，因为高速增长已经触及环境极限。
Even as the pace of growth slows, China is contributing more to the world economy than ever before, because its GDP today is $10.3 trillion, up from just $2.3 trillion in 2005.	即使增长速度有所放缓，中国对世界经济的贡献仍比以往任何时候都要大，因为其GDP如今已达10.3万亿美元，而2005年只有2.3万亿美元。
Simple arithmetic shows that $10.3 trillion growing at 6% or 7% produces much bigger numbers than 10% growth starting from a base that is almost five times smaller.	简单计算就可知道，10.3万亿美元增长6%或7%所得到的数字要比在基数只有五分之一大小的基础上增长10%大得多。
This base effect also means that China will continue to absorb more natural resources than ever before, despite its diminishing growth prospects.	这一基数效应也意味着中国将继续比以往任何时候吸收更多的自然资源，尽管其增长前景在趋弱。
Yet China is causing high anxiety, especially in emerging countries, largely because financial markets have convinced themselves that its economy is not only slowing, but falling off a cliff.	但中国正在制造很大的焦虑，特别是在新型国家，这在很大程度上是因为金融市场让自己相信，其经济不仅仅是放缓，简直是掉落悬崖。
Many Western analysts, especially in financial institutions, treat China’s official GDP growth of around 7% as a political fabrication – and the IMF’s latest confirmation of its 6.8% estimate is unlikely to convince them.	许多西方分析师，特别是金融机构分析师，认为中国7%左右的官方GDP增长数字是政治造假 — — IMF最近确认6.8%的估计值也没能让他们消停。
They point to steel, coal, and construction statistics, which really are collapsing in several Chinese regions, and to exports, which are growing much less than in the past.	他们拿钢铁、煤炭和建筑业数字（在中国的一些地区，这些数字确实呈现出崩溃之势 ） ， 以及出口数字（增长比以往大幅下降）作为论据。
But why do the skeptics accept the truth of dismal government figures for construction and steel output – down 15% and 4%, respectively, in the year to August – and then dismiss official data showing 10.8% retail-sales growth?	但为何怀疑者接受政府公布的黯淡的建筑业和钢铁产出数字 — — 今年前八个月分别同比下降15%和4 % ， 而抨击零售业销售增长10.8%的官方数据？
One reason can be found in the financier George Soros’s concept of “reflexivity.”	一个理由可以从金融家乔治·索罗斯（George Soros）的“反身性”中找到。
Soros has argued for years that financial markets can create inaccurate expectations and then change reality to accord with them.	索罗斯多年前就指出，金融市场可以炮制不正确的预期，然后根据这些预期改变现实。
This is the opposite of the process described in textbooks and built into economic models, which always assume that financial expectations adapt to reality, not the other way round.	这与教科书中所描述的、被纳入经济模型的过程正好相反，后者总是假设金融预期根据现实调整，而不是相反。
In a classic example of reflexivity, when China’s stock-market boom turned into July’s bust, the government responded with a $200 billion attempt to support prices, closely followed by a small devaluation of the previously stable renminbi.	一个反身性的经典例子是，今年7月中国股市繁荣转变为萧条时，政府的反应时投入2,000美元托市，并立刻继之以此前一直稳定的人民币小幅贬值。
Financial analysts almost universally ridiculed these policies and castigated Chinese leaders for abandoning their earlier pretenses of market-oriented reforms.	金融分析师几乎一边倒地揶揄这些政策，抨击中国领导人放弃了早前装模作样的市场改革。
The government’s apparent desperation was seen as evidence that China was in far greater trouble than previously revealed.	政府显而易见的焦急之情被视为中国的麻烦远比此前揭示的更严重的证据。
This belief quickly shaped reality, as market analysts blurred the distinction between a growth slowdown and economic collapse.	这一信念很快影响了现实，因为市场分析师混淆了增长放缓与经济崩溃之间的区别。
In mid-September, for example, when the private-sector Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) came out at 47.0, the result was generally reported along these lines: “The index has now indicated contraction in the [manufacturing] sector for seven consecutive months.”	比如，9月中旬，采购经理人指数（PMI）来到了47.0，当时一般的报道是这样的 ： “ 目前，采购经理人指数表明[制造]部门连续七个月萎缩 。 ”
In fact, Chinese manufacturing was growing by 5-7% throughout that period.	事实上，在此期间中国制造业以5—7%增长。
The supposed evidence was wrong because 50 is the PMI’s dividing line not between growth and recession, but between accelerating and slowing growth.	这一想当然的证据是错误���，因为50是PMI的分界线，但它不是增长和衰退的分界线，而是增长加速和减速的分界线。
Indeed, for 19 out of the PMI’s 36 months of existence, the value has been below 50, while Chinese manufacturing growth has averaged 7.5%.	事实上，在有PIM数据的36个月中，19个月的数值低于50，而这段时间中国制造业增长率平均为7.5 % 。
Exaggerations of this kind have undermined confidence in Chinese policy at a particularly dangerous time.	类似的夸张在最危险的时候破坏了对中国政策的信心。
China is now navigating a complex economic transition that involves three sometimes-conflicting objectives: creating a market-based consumer economy; reforming the financial system; and ensuring an orderly slowdown that avoids the economic collapse often accompanying industrial restructuring and financial liberalization.	如今，中国处于复杂的经济转型中，这一转型包括三个有时互相冲突的目标：建立基于市场的消费经济、改革金融体系，以及确保有序减速，避免常常与产业结构重组和金融自由化相伴而生的经济崩溃。
Managing this trifecta successfully will require skillful juggling of priorities – and that will become much more difficult if Chinese policymakers lose international investors’ trust or, more important, that of China’s own citizens and businesses.	成功管好这三重目标需要纯熟地制定重点 — — 而如果中国决策者失去国际投资者的信任，或者，更重要地，失去中国自身公民和企业的信任，难度将大大增加。
Vicious circles of economic instability, devaluation, and capital flight have brought down seemingly unbreakable regimes throughout history.	在历史上，经济动荡、贬值和资本外逃的恶性循环频频令看似不可动摇的政权轰然倒塌。
This probably explains the whiff of panic that followed China’s tiny, but totally unexpected, devaluation of the renminbi.	这也许可以解释为何人民币小幅（但完全出人意料的）贬值会带来恐慌。
The renminbi, however, has recently stabilized, and capital flight has dwindled, as evidenced by the better-than-expected reserve figures released by the People’s Bank of China on October 7.	但是，人民币最近已经稳定下来，资本外逃也得到了遏制，好于预期的10月7日中国人民银行储备数字证明了这一点。
This suggests that the government’s policy of shifting gradually to a market-based exchange rate may have been better executed than generally believed; even the measures to support the stock market now look less futile than they did in July.	这表明中国政府逐渐朝市场汇率转变的政策也许比一般认为的执行得更好；即使是支持股市的措施，现在看起来也并不像7月时那样无用。
In short, Chinese economic management seems less incompetent than it did a few months ago.	简言之，中国经济管理似乎不再像几个月前那样无能。
Indeed, China can probably avoid the financial meltdown widely feared in the summer.	事实上，中国也许可以避免夏天人们广泛担忧的金融崩溃。
If so, other emerging economies tied to perceptions about China’s economic health should also stabilize.	果真如此的话，仰仗对中国经济健康程度看法的其他新兴经济体也应该稳定下来。
The world has learned since 2008 how dangerously financial expectations can interact with policy blunders, turning modest economic problems into major catastrophes, first in the US and then in the eurozone.	2008年以来，世界已经领教了金融预期与政策错误的互动是多么危险，这可能将不大的经济问题转变为巨大的灾难，美国和欧元区先后“中招 ” 。
It would be ironic if China’s Communist leaders turned out to have a better understanding of capitalism’s reflexive interactions among finance, the real economy, and government than Western devotees of free markets.	如果中国的共产党领导人对金融、实体经济和政府之间的资本主义反身性互动的理解比西方自由市场信徒还要优秀，这将颇为讽刺。
	
Why China is Right on the Renminbi	人民币渐进升值完全正确
BERKELEY – After a period of high tension between the United States and China, culminating earlier this month in rumblings of an all-out trade war, it is now evident that a change in Chinese exchange-rate policy is coming.	伯克利 — — 前一阵子，美中关系非常紧张，到4月初最严重的时候，差点爆发一场全面贸易战。 目前，形势已有所缓和，中国即将调整汇率政策这一点，也已经明朗了。
China is finally prepared to let the renminbi resume its slow but steady upward march.	最终，中国准备让人民币重拾缓慢、稳步升值的脚步。
We can now expect the renminbi to begin appreciating again, very gradually, against the dollar, as it did between 2005 and 2007.	我们现在可以预计，人民币将再度开始对美元渐进升值，就像2005到2007年时那样。
Some observers, including those most fearful of a trade war, will be relieved.	一部分观察家，尤其是那些最担心贸易战的人，应该可以放心了。
Others, who see a substantially undervalued renminbi as a significant factor in US unemployment, will be disappointed by gradual adjustment.	但其他一些人，认为人民币低估是造成美国失业的一个重要因素，渐进升值会令他们失望。
They would have preferred a sharp revaluation of perhaps 20% in order to make a noticeable dent in the US unemployment rate.	他们更希望见到人民币一下子升值20 % ， 从而明显地遏制美国的失业上升势头。
Still others dismiss the change in Chinese exchange-rate policy as beside the point.	还有一些人则认为，中国调整汇率政策是避重就轻。
For them, the Chinese current-account surplus and its mirror image, the US current-account deficit, are the central problem.	在他们看来，中国经常账户盈余和相应的美国经常账户赤字才是问题的关键。
They argue that current-account balances reflect national savings and investment rates.	他们说经常账户平衡是国民储蓄—投资率的反映。
China is running external surpluses because its saving exceeds its investment.	中国账上之所以有对外盈余，是因为其国民总储蓄超出其国民总投资。
The US is running external deficits because of a national savings shortfall, which once reflected spendthrift households but now is the fault of a feckless government.	美国账上之所以是对外赤字，是因为其国民总储蓄不足 — — 以前这得怪居民的过度开支，现在则是政府大手大脚的错。
There is no reason, they conclude, why a change in the renminbi-dollar exchange rate should have a first-order impact on savings or investment in China, much less in the US.	他们从而得出结论说，人民币对美元汇率上的调整没有理由对中国的储蓄与投资产生重大影响，更别提对美国的储蓄与投资有什么影响了。
There is no reason, therefore, why it should have a first-order impact on the bilateral current-account balance, or, for that matter, on unemployment, which depends on the same saving and investment behavior.	因此，看不出这个调整能对双方经常账户的平衡起到什么显著作用，换言之，对美国的失业也不会有什么作用，因为后者也是储蓄和投资行为的一种反映。
In fact, both sets of critics have it wrong.	事实上，上述两种批评都错了。
China was right to wait in adjusting its exchange rate, and it is now right to move gradually rather than discontinuously.	不论是之前暂缓调整汇率，还是现在选择渐进调整而非激进调整，中国都是对的。
The Chinese economy is growing at potential: forecasts put the prospective rate for 2010 at 10%; the first-quarter flash numbers, at 11.9%, show it expanding as fast as any economy can safely grow.	中国经济的增长率接近潜在增长率：多方预测2010年中国经济将增长10 % ； 第一季度的初步统计是11.9 % ， 表明中国经济的扩张速度已达到安全增长水平的上限，再快就不安全了。
China successfully navigated the crisis, avoiding a significant slowdown, by ramping up public spending.	中国成功地应对了全球金融危机，避免了大幅度的经济减速，靠的是扩大公共支出。
But, as a result, it now has no further scope for increasing public consumption or investment.	但因此，它现在已没有扩大公共开支或投资的余地了。
To be sure, building a social safety net, developing financial markets, and strengthening corporate governance to encourage state enterprises to pay out more of what they earn would encourage Chinese households to consume.	社会保障体系的完善、金融市场的发展、国有企业分红机制的建立等等，固然有助于鼓励中国居民增加消费。
But such reforms take years to complete.	但是这些改革都需要几年时间才能完成。
In the meantime, the rate of spending growth in China will not change dramatically.	在相当长一段时间内，中国的消费不可能有大幅度的增长。
As a result, Chinese policymakers have been waiting to see whether the recovery in the US is real.	所以，中国的决策者需要审时度势，观察美国的经济复苏是否能持续。
If it is, China’s exports will grow more rapidly.	如果是，中国的出口增长将会加快。
And if its exports grow more rapidly, they can allow the renminbi to rise.	如果它的出口增长加快，他们就可以让人民币升值了。
Without that exchange-rate adjustment, faster export growth would expose the Chinese economy to the risk of overheating.	如果出口增速上去了，还不调整汇率的话，将会使中国经济面临过热风险。
But, with the adjustment, Chinese consumers will spend more on imports and less on domestic goods.	调整则会促使中国消费者增加进口商品消费，减少国产商品消费。
Overheating having been avoided, the Chinese economy can keep motoring ahead at its customary 10% annual pace.	过热由此得以避免，中国经济仍能以10%的年增长率大步向前。
Evidence that the US recovery will be sustained is mounting.	有越来越多的证据表明，美国经济复苏的确是可持续的。
As always, there is no guarantee.	当然，这一点永远不能打包票。
But the latest data on sales of light vehicles, as well as the Institute of Supply Management’s manufacturing index and the Bureau of Labor Statistics employment report, all point in this direction.	但最新的轻型车辆销售数据、采购经理指数和劳动统计署发布的失业报告都指向这一方向。
Because the increase in US spending on Chinese exports will be gradual, it also is appropriate for the adjustment in the renminbi-dollar exchange rate to be gradual. If China recklessly revalued its exchange rate by 20%, as certain foreigners recommend, the result could be a sharp fall in spending on its goods, which would undermine growth.	复苏中的美国会增加其在中国出口产品上的支出，但这将是一个渐进的过程，因此，人民币对美元汇率的调整也应当是渐进的。 如果中国像某些外国专家建议的那样，贸然让人民币一下子升值20 % ， 美国对其出口产品的购买将会骤跌，从而打击中国的经济增长。
Moreover, gradual adjustment in the bilateral exchange rate is needed to prevent global imbalances from blowing out.	此外，如果要避免全球收支不平衡突然崩盘，双边汇率的调整只能是渐进的。
US growth will be driven by the recovery of investment, which fell precipitously during the crisis.	在经历了危机中的暴跌之后已经，美国的投资水平有所恢复，这将驱动美国经济增长。
But, as investment now rises relative to saving, there is a danger that the US current-account deficit, which fell from 6% of GDP in 2006 to barely 2.5% of GDP last year, will widen again.	但是目前也出现了投资增长快于储蓄增长的势头，美国经常账户赤字 — — 从2006年占GDP的6%下降到去年的2.5 % — —有再次扩大的危险。
Renminbi appreciation that switches Chinese spending toward foreign goods, including US exports, will work against this tendency.	人民币升值将促使中国人购买更多的外国商品，包括美国商品，这将在一定程度上抵消美国经常账户赤字扩大的势头。
By giving American firms more earnings, it will increase corporate savings in the US.	美国企业营收增加将带动企业储蓄增加。
And it will reconcile recovery in the US with the need to prevent global imbalances from again threatening financial stability.	这一方面有助于美国经济复苏，另一方面也有助于节制全球收支不平衡，防止它再度威胁金融稳定。
Chinese officials have been on the receiving end of a lot of gratuitous advice.	中国官员见多了廉价兜售的忠告。
They have been wise to disregard it.	他们明智地置之不理。
In managing their exchange rate, they have gotten it exactly right.	在管理汇率方面，他们的选择是完全正确的。
	
China’s Reform Anxiety	中国的改革忧虑症
BEIJING – Since 2010, global financial circles have been obsessing about China’s slowing economy.	发自北京 — — 自2010年以来，全球金融圈都被中国经济的减速所困扰着。
But, while the country barely met the official target of 7.5% annual GDP growth in the second quarter of this year – generating significant anxiety worldwide – China’s government seemingly remains calm, showing no indication that it plans to launch yet another stimulus package.	而在该国今年第二季度勉强实现官方订立的7.5%年度GDP增长指标之时 — — 这令全球各界一片恐慌 — — 中国政府却表现平静，并未出现计划实施另一轮经济刺激计划的迹象。
Do China’s leaders really have the situation under control?	但中国的领导人们是否真的如此胸有成竹？
In fact, the Chinese government’s stance – based on Premier Li Keqiang’s “Likonomics,” which prioritizes structural reform over rapid GDP growth – will prove to be in the best interests of China and the rest of the world.	事实上，中国政府的立场 — — 构建于国家总理李克强的“李克强经济学理论”之上，即所谓把结构改革摆在比GDP高速长更重要的位置 — — 将最终被证明是符合中国以及全世界利益的。
China’s structural problems – including restrictions on labor mobility, a rigid and risk-laden financial system, and excessive reliance on government investment – are threatening its stability and economic development.	中国的结构性问题，包括对劳动力流动的限制，僵化且背负大量风险的金融系统，以及对政府投资的过度依赖 — — 无一不在威胁着自身的稳定及其经济发展。
Given that China’s GDP growth rate remains respectable relative to the rest of the world, the need to emphasize structural reform is clear.	考虑到中国的GDP增速相对于其他国家来说依然较高，推行结构性改革的需要也更为明确了。
But, despite well-intentioned statements and narrow gestures, China’s new leadership has yet to establish a concrete, bold reform plan capable of resolving the economy’s deep-rooted problems.	但与此同时，虽然发表了充满良好意愿的声明以及相对明确的姿态，中国的新领导层仍未订立一个切实明确，足以解决当前经济中存在的深层次问题的改革计划。
For example, last February, the State Council announced plans to reform the hukou (household registration) system, which assigns legal residency according to a person’s place of birth.	比如说，今年二月，国务院发布了旨在改革户口制度的相关计划。
The system makes relocating very difficult, as those who do not manage to acquire local residency permits face major hurdles in gaining access to public services when they migrate to other provinces.	由于该制度按照公民的出生地来划定其合法居住地，因此对人们的移居流动造成了极大障碍，那些移居其他省份却没能获取当地居留权的人在享受当地公共服务方面也面临重重阻碍。
Indeed, their children are even prohibited from taking college entrance exams.	事实上，这些人的子女甚至没有在当地参加高考的权力。
The reform plan was supposed to improve the situation by allowing migrants in towns and small cities to acquire local residency permits more freely, while easing the requirements in medium-sized cities.	这一改革计划正是为了改善上述状况，允许小型城镇的流动人口更容易获得当地居留资格，同时放宽中型城市的相关限制条件。
But efforts to reform the system have been met with strong resistance, especially from local governments and residents, who fear the strain that unregulated migration to their cities will have on resources, employment, and services.	但改革却遭遇了极大阻力，尤其是各地政府和居民的反对，因为担心不加限制的移民会对本地的资源，就业和公共服务带来压力。
As a result, a genuine hukou reform strategy remains elusive.	结果一场切实的户口改革依然迟迟无法来临。
Similarly, the government has been slow to formulate and implement effective financial-market reforms.	同样，政府在制定和实施有效金融市场改革方面也是极为迟缓。
Hopes were high early this year, when the State Council announced a strategy aimed at liberalizing the capital account, establishing a more flexible exchange-rate policy, and opening the financial sector to domestic private capital.	人们在今年年初之时本来对此充满期望，因为国务院推出了一项战略，目标是放松资本庄户管制，建立一个更加灵活的汇率政策，并允许国内私人资本进入金融部门。
But the government then heeded influential economists’ warnings of the risks of relaxing capital controls too hastily.	但政府随后又听到一些著名经济学家的言论，认为仓促放松资本管制会产生风险。
In fact, the opposite should be happening.	然而事实上，出现的情况将会恰恰相反。
Narrow policies like the government’s recent credit tightening will make it difficult to direct financial resources to the real economy – one of the primary objectives of “Likonomics.”	类似政府最近收紧信贷这样的狭隘政策将使其难以将金融资源导入实体经济 — — 而这正是李克强经济学的一个重要目标。
Genuine progress depends on Chinese leaders’ willingness to address the structural flaws – namely, the restrictions on domestic private capital – that are impeding the financial system’s ability to channel savings to the most promising economic sectors.	真正的推进取决于中国领导人解决结构性缺陷的意愿 — — 换句话说，就是对本国私人资本的管制 — — 也正是这一缺陷限制了金融系统将存款导向那些最具发展潜力经济部门的能力。
Despite several rounds of deregulation, it remains very difficult to establish private banks in China, and rules on non-banking financial institutions are often unclear.	尽管进行了多轮放松管制，民间资本想在银行依然极为困难，而对非银行金融机构的管理条例又往往语焉不详。
As a result, shadow banking, which provides capital at triple the cost implied by the official base interest rate, is flourishing – and generating significant uncertainty and risk.	结果那些以3倍于官方基准理率的贷款利息来放贷的影子银行大量出现 — — 并因此产生了极大的不确定性和风险。
Although the government recently attempted to attract capital back to the official banking sector by eliminating the lending rate’s lower bound, more substantial reform is needed – and that will likely have to wait until the interest rate on deposits is fully liberalized and the financial sector is open to private banks.	虽然政府最近试图通过取消贷款利率下限的方式来吸引资本回归国有银行部门，但外界依然迫切需要更加切实的改革 — — 这很可能要等到存款利率完全放开以及金融部门向私人资本银行开放之后了。
In many other areas, too, China’s government either remains indecisive or is offering only rhetoric and small gestures.	在许多其他领域也是如此，中国政府要么犹豫不决，要么只有一些空话或者微小的动作。
For example, the devolution of some project-approval powers to local governments will not solve the underlying problem of excessive state intervention in the economy; on the contrary, it may even enhance the state’s role by giving local governments more freedom to carry out investment projects.	例如将一些项目审批权移交给当地政府其实无法解决国家过度插手经济的根本问题；相反，通过给予地方政府更多推行投资项目的自由，国家所扮演的角色甚至更强大了。
China’s leaders know what is wrong with the country’s economy.	中国领导人知道本国的经济出了什么问题。
But, as their efforts over the last several months have highlighted, they are uncertain as to how to go about fixing it – a fact that is generating significant anxiety in financial markets and among the general public.	但正如他们在过去几个月的举动所体现的那样，他们并不知道如何下手去解决这些问题 — — 这在金融市场和人民群众之中造成了极大的担忧。
As senior Chinese officials gather for their annual summer meeting in Beidaihe, a coastal resort near Beijing, they must recognize the need for a bold plan for genuine structural reform.	希望那些高级领导人聚集在北戴河开年度会议时能认识到推行一个实现真正结构性改革的勇敢计划的重要性。
Otherwise, anxiety will eventually give rise to mistrust, making a comprehensive reform strategy even more difficult to implement.	否则的话，担忧将最终升级为不信任，使得一场全面改革更加难以实施。
	
Is State Capitalism Winning?	国家资本主义赢了吗？
CAMBRIDGE – In the age-old contest of economic-growth models, state capitalism has seemed to be gaining the upper hand in recent years.	美国剑桥—在由来已久的经济增长模式之辨中，国家资本主义似乎在近几年中占了上风。
Avatars of liberal capitalism like the United States and the United Kingdom continued to perform anemically in 2012, while many Asian countries, relying on various versions of dirigisme, have not only grown rapidly and steadily over the last several decades, but have also weathered recent economic storms with surprising grace.	美国和英国等自由资本主义的化身在2012年继续表现萎靡，而许多亚洲国家依靠各式各样的政府干预，不但在过去几十年中实现了快速稳步增长，而且成功抵御了最近的竞技风暴，令人刮目相看。
So, is it time to update the economics textbooks?	那么，经济学教科书应该因此而改写吗？
In fact, economics does not say that unfettered markets are better than state intervention or even state capitalism.	事实上，经济学从未宣布自由放任市场比国家干预甚至国家资本主义更好。
The problems with state capitalism are primarily political, not economic.	国家资本主义的问题主要是政治上的，不是经济上的。
Any real-world economy is riddled with market failures, so a benevolent and omnipotent government could sensibly intervene quite often.	任何现实世界的经济体都会经历市场失灵，因此仁慈的、权力无限的政府很可能会经常出售干预。
But who has ever met a benevolent or omnipotent government?	但你见过权力无限又仁慈的政府吗？
To understand the logic of state capitalism, it is useful to recall some early examples – not the socialist command economies or modern societies seeking to combat market failures, but ancient civilizations.	为了理解国家资本主义的逻辑，回忆一些早期例子是有裨益的 — — 不是社会主义指令经济，也不是试图战胜市场失灵的现代社会，而是古老文明。
Indeed, it seems that, like farming or democracy, state capitalism has been independently invented many times in world history.	事实上，与农业或民主一样，国家资本主义在世界史的各个阶段独立地出现过。
Consider the Greek Bronze Age, during which many powerful states, organized around a city housing the political elite, formed throughout the Mediterranean basin.	比如希腊青铜时代（Greek Bronze Age ） 。 在此期间，在地中海周围形成了聚集在政治精英周围的城邦国家。
These states had no money and essentially no markets.	这些国家没有货币，事实上也没有市场。
The state taxed agricultural output and controlled nearly all goods production.	国家课以农业产品税，并控制着几乎所有商品的生产。
It monopolized trade, and, in the absence of money, moved all of the goods around by fiat.	国家垄断贸易，并且在没有货币存在的情况下，所有商品的流通都必须得到法令的许可。
It supplied food and inputs to weavers and then took their output.	国家向工人提供食品和原料，收取他们的产出。
In essence, the Greek Bronze Age societies had something that looked remarkably like state capitalism.	本质而言，希腊青铜时代社会的某些元素和国家资本主义极为相似。
So did the Incas as they built their huge Andean empire in the century before the Spanish arrived.	印加人也是如此。 西班牙人到来之前，他们建立了巨大的安第斯帝国。
They, too, had no money (or writing); but the state conducted decennial censuses, built roughly 25,000 miles (40,000 kilometers) of roads, operated a system of runners to send messages and collect information, and recorded it all using knotted strings called quipus, most of which cannot be read today.	他们也没有货币（和文字 ） ， 但国家会组织十年一次的人口调查，建造了约25000英里（40000公里）的道路，建立了传驿制度用于送信和收集情报，所有信息都用结绳记事的办法传递，大部分今天已无法解读。
All of this was part of their control of land and labor, based on centrally planned allocation of resources and coercion.	所有这些都是他们对土地和劳动的控制的一部分，其基础是中央计划的资源配置和高压。
How is it that societies as disparate as the Greek Bronze Age cities of Knossos, Mycenae, or Pylos, the Inca Empire, Soviet Russia, South Korea, and now China all ended up with state capitalism?	希腊青铜时代城邦（如克诺索斯、迈锡尼和皮洛斯 ） 、 印加帝国、苏联、韩国以及现在的中国，这��截然不同的社会是如何最终变为国家资本主义的呢？
The answer lies in recognizing that state capitalism is not about efficient allocation of economic resources, but about maximizing political control over society and the economy.	要知道答案，你必须理解国家资本主义并不是关于有效配置经济资源的问题，而是关于实现对社会和经济的政治控制最大化的问题。
If state managers can grab all productive resources and control access to them, this maximizes control – even if it sacrifices economic efficiency.	如果国家管理者可以攫取所有生产性资源，控制获得这些资源的途径，他们就实现了控制的最大化 — — 即使这会牺牲经济效率。
To be sure, in many parts of the world, state capitalism has helped to consolidate states and centralize authority – preconditions for the development of modern societies and economies.	平心而论，在世界的许多地方，国家资本主义有助于巩固国家和集中权力，而这是现代社会和经济发展的先决条件。
But political control of the economy generally becomes problematic, because those running the state do not have social welfare or optimal resource allocation in mind.	但对经济的政治控制一般总会形成问题，因为治国者头脑中并没有社会福利和最优资源配置的概念。
The state capitalism of the Greek Bronze Age or the Inca Empire was not motivated by economic inefficiency; nor did it necessarily create a more efficient economy.	希腊青铜时代和银家德国的国家资本主义的动机并非经济上的无效；让经济更具效率也不是它们的目标。
What it did was help to consolidate political power.	它们所做的是巩固政治权力。
At a deeper level, the real dichotomy is not between state capitalism and unfettered markets; it is between extractive and inclusive economic institutions.	从更深层面讲，真正的二分不在于国家资本主义和自由放任的市场；而在于掠夺性和包容性的经济制度。
Extractive institutions create a non-level playing field, rents, and narrowly concentrated benefits for those with political power and connections.	掠夺性制度创造了不公平的条件、租以及狭隘集中的利益，得利者是掌握政治权力者及其关系网。
Inclusive institutions create a level playing field and give incentives and opportunities to the great mass of people.	包容性制度创造了公平的条件，为普罗大众提供激励和机会。
But herein lies the problem for state capitalism: inclusive institutions require a private sector powerful enough to counterbalance and check the state.	但国家资本主义的问题就在这里：包容性制度要求私人部门强大到足以制衡国家指令。
Thus, state ownership tends naturally to remove one of the key pillars of an inclusive society.	因此，国家所有权自然而然地倾向于毁掉包容性社会的这一支柱。
It should be no surprise that state capitalism is almost always associated with authoritarian regimes and extractive political institutions.	毫不奇怪，国家资本主义几乎总是和独裁政权和掠夺性政治制度一起出现。
This is not an endorsement of unfettered markets.	这可不是对自由放任市场的认同。
The state plays a central role in modern society, and rightly so.	国家在现代社会中扮演着核心角色，理应如此。
Modern economic growth, even under inclusive institutions, often creates deep inequalities and tilted playing fields, endangering those institutions’ very survival.	即使在包容性制度下，现代经济增长也常常会造成严重的不平等和特权，危害这些制度的生存。
The modern regulatory and redistributive state can, within certain bounds, help to redress these problems.	现代管理型和再分配型国家可以在一定的约束内纠正这些问题。
But the success of such a project crucially depends on society having control over the state – not the other way around.	但能否成功关键取决于社会控制国家，而不是相反。
To argue that state capitalism’s success proves its superiority is to put the cart before the horse.	说国家资本主义的成功证明了其优越性无异于本末倒置。
Yes, South Korea grew rapidly under state capitalism, and China is doing likewise today.	是的，韩国在国家资本主义下取得了快速增长，眼下，中国也在重复这一成功。
But state capitalism emerged not because there was no other way to ensure economic growth in these countries, but because it enabled growth without destabilizing the existing power structure.	但国家资本主义的兴起并不是因为没有其他办法可以确保这些国家的经济增长，而是因为它能在不动摇现有权力结构的情况下让增长得以实现。
The genius of China’s state capitalism is that it ensured the continued dominance of Communist Party elites while improving the allocation of resources, not that it alone could have provided price incentives to farmers and then managed liberalization of urban markets.	中国国家资本主义的高明之处在于它确保了中国共产党精英的主导地位，同时又能改善资源配置，而是在于凭此就能为农民提供价格激励，并在此后管理好城市市场的自由化。
State capitalism will persist so long as existing elites are able to maintain it and benefit from it – even if economic growth ultimately stalls.	只要精英能够维持国家资本主义并从中获益，国家资本主义就会存在下去 — — 即使经济增长最终陷入停滞。
And there is a good reason why it eventually will.	有充分的理由表明，最终将会如此。
Sustained economic growth presupposes inclusive institutions, because innovation – and the creative destruction and instability that it wreaks – depends on them.	持续经济增长以包容性制度为先决条件，因为创新 — — 以及创造性破坏及其所蕴含的不稳定性 — — 取决于包容性制度。
Extractive institutions in general, and state capitalism in particular, can support economic growth for a while, but only the sort of catch-up growth that South Korea experienced from the 1960’s to the 1980’s, before starting to transform its society and economy more radically.	掠夺性制度（一般而言）和国家资本主义（尤其如此）能够维持经济增长一阵子，但像韩国在20世纪60—80年代的赶超增长经历已是极限，此后，社会和经济就必须开始更加彻底的转型。
As the low hanging fruit from catch-up growth is consumed, China, too, will be forced to choose between the economic and social freedom, innovation, and instability that only inclusive institutions can underpin and continued economic, political, and social control in the service of the elites who control the state.	中国正在享用唾手可得的赶超增长果实，最终，它也将被迫做出选择：要么是经济和社会自由、创新、和动荡 — — 唯有包容性制度可以承受；要么是控制国家的精英为饱一己之私继续控制经济、政治和社会。
	
Quitting the Quota	放弃配额制度难在哪里？
HONG KONG – On March 1, China’s State Council announced a new batch of restrictions aimed at reining in property prices by curbing speculative demand. The measures include tighter limits on home purchases by non-locals in cities with excessive price gains, a reinforced 20% capital-gains tax, mandatory 70% down payments, and a 30% benchmark interest-rate premium for second mortgages.	发自香港 — — 3月1日，中国国务院宣布了新一轮旨在通过遏制投机性需求控制房价的限制措施，其中包括在房价上涨过快的城市严格控制外地户籍人口购房，强制征收20%卖房资产所得税，并将第二套房首付比例设为70 % ， 以及二套房贷相对基准利率上浮30 % 。
While the previous round of housing-sector restrictions, implemented less than two years ago, dampened market sentiment temporarily, it failed to curb rising property prices.	回顾一年多前，政府实施的上一轮购房限制措施只是短暂地打击了市场热情，却未能遏制房产价格继续上涨。
Likewise, although the latest measures might have some impact, cooling China’s turbulent property market – which relies on cheap credit – in the long term will require addressing underlying monetary-policy weaknesses.	同样，尽管最新的措施可能会发挥一定作用，比如让低利息导致狂热的中国房地产市场降降温，但从长期来看还是需要解决根本的货币政策缺陷。
In order to control the money supply, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has long used credit quotas as “window guidance” to banks.	为了控制货币供给，中国人民银行长期使用信贷配额作为对银行的“窗口指导 ” 。
The policy is rooted in central planning, which, three decades ago, led to artificially low prices and, in turn, to shortages of basic necessities and key production inputs, such as grain and steel.	这项政策源自于中央计划经济。 三十年前的计划经济导致了人为的低物价，并进而导致了基本必需品和关键生产要素，比如粮食和钢材的短缺。
As the free market developed, a dual-price system emerged, in which those with access to quota-allocated goods paid less.	其后随着市场机制在中国的引入及发展，催生了价格双轨制，使得那些有能力获得产品配额的人只需支付较低的价格。
As a result, the government was compelled to grant subsidies to the system’s “losers” – such as urban residents and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) – until strong supply responses to rising market prices eliminated the need for quotas on manufactured products.	政府实际上在补贴双轨制下的“失败者 ” ， 比如城市居民和国有企业。 但很快，市场价格的上涨导致了强劲的供给反应，并消除了人们对产品配额的需求。
A decade later, in response to the global financial crisis, China loosened credit quotas and planning controls on SOE-run local-government infrastructure projects.	五年前，为应对全球金融危机，中国放宽了信贷配额和对地方政府基础设施项目（通常由国企执行）的规划控制。
Between November 2008 and June 2009, China’s banks issued more than ¥8.6 trillion ($1.3 trillion) in new loans.	于是在2008年11月至2009年6月间，中国的银行共发放超过8.6万亿元人民币（合1.3万亿美元）的新增贷款。
As a result, the rate of credit growth increased from 14% in September 2008 to 35% a year later, and property prices more than doubled in many cities.	信贷增长的速度因此从2008年9月的14%一举上升到一年后的35 % ， 很多城市的房价也随之翻番。
Excessively low interest rates have generated a mismatch between housing prices and the available supply, because they serve as hidden subsidies for those who can borrow – for example, the rich and SOEs – and thus stimulate demand for luxury property.	过低的利率导致了房价与有效供给之间的错配，因为对那些可以从银行获得低息贷款的人（比如富人和国企）来说这其实是一种隐性补贴，从而刺激了高端地产的需求。
In order to curb this trend, policymakers have reverted to the quota as a macroeconomic tool, but this time for housing credit.	为了遏制这种趋势，政策制定者恢���了配额这一宏观经济工具，但这一次是针对住房信贷。
Like quotas on manufactured products, these new quotas are generating a dual-price allocation system, in which SOEs can borrow at significantly lower interest rates than small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), which must rely on the informal market at interest rates as high as 2% monthly.	正如对制造业产品的配额限制一样，这些新的配额正在催生一个双轨价格分配体系，在该体系下国企可以用远低于中小企业的利率取得贷款，而后者则必须以高达2%的月息从非正式市场融资。
But eliminating quotas in order to allow prices to reach market-clearing levels is not an option this time, owing to the complexity and competitiveness of the real-estate and bank-credit markets.	但由于房地产和银行信贷市场的复杂性和非竞争性，为使价格达到市场均衡水平而取消配额在目前也并非一个好的选择。
Three major factors are impeding policymakers from raising interest rates to market-clearing levels.	有三大主要因素阻碍了政策制定者将利率提高到市场均衡水平。
First, the domestic interest groups that benefit from low borrowing costs have become a barrier to their liberalization.	首先，受益于低息借贷的国内利益集团已成为利率改革与提高利率的障碍。
There is a “common-sense consensus” among borrowers – in China, as well as in highly indebted advanced economies – that raising interest rates would undermine GDP growth, employment, and asset prices.	中国以及高负债发达国家中的贷款者持有一种“常识性共识 ” — —利率的上升不利于GDP增长、就业和资产价格。
Second, many argue that raising interest rates would trigger a flood of speculative capital from low-yielding advanced economies.	其二，许多人认为提高利率会吸引大量来自低收益发达经济体的投机性资本。
With the PBOC unable to sterilize the inflows, upward pressure on the renminbi’s exchange rate would threaten competitiveness.	如果中国人民银行未能恰当对冲这些资本流入，那么人民币汇率的上升压力将会威胁中国企业的竞争力。
Finally, an inadequate understanding of structural inflation (the growth in prices for non-tradable assets) has generated the false belief that China can maintain similar levels of inflation and exchange-rate stability as the OECD economies.	最后，对结构性通胀（无法直接参与国际贸易的资产的价格增长，如房价及农民工的工资）的认识不足导致了一个错误的观点 — — 中国能够保持与经合组织经济体相似的通胀水平及汇率的稳定度。
As a result, over the last decade, the Chinese authorities’ implicit target for annual inflation and currency appreciation has been only about 3%.	这就导致在过去的十年中，当局为年度通胀率和货币升值幅度设立的隐性指标仅为3%左右。
But China has attained much higher GDP growth than the OECD economies, driven largely by the rapid productivity gains that characterize the initial “catch up” phase of emerging-market development.	然而，中国的GDP增长远高于经合组织成员国。 这很大程度上是由快速的生产率增长所驱动，也正是新兴市场初始“追赶”阶段的特征。
As China continues to implement market-oriented reforms, the prices of non-tradable assets – such as property, natural resources, utilities, services, and wages – will continue to rise much faster than in the OECD countries, until they eventually converge.	由于中国继续实施市场化改革，无法直接参与国际贸易的资产 — — 如房地产、自然资源、公共基础设施、本地服务、和非技术工人 — — 其价格的上升速度将继续高于经合组织成员国，直到双方价格最终接近。
This process will inevitably lead to higher structural inflation and currency appreciation in China.	这个过程将不可避免地导致中国出现更高的结构性通胀或货币升值。
If nominal interest rates are lower than the real return on investment – associated with GDP growth – the result is financial repression and increased income and wealth inequality.	如果名义利率比投资的实际回报（这一回报与GDP增长相关）要低，结果就是金融抑制，以及收入与财富不平等加剧。
To avoid this outcome, as long as China’s GDP growth exceeds that of OECD economies, its nominal interest rates must also be higher, its exchange rate must be more flexible, and it must tolerate higher structural inflation.	为了避免这种结果，只要中国的GDP增长超过经合组织成员国，我们的名义利率也应该相应提高，汇率应该更具弹性，而且必须承受更高的结构性通胀或人民币升值。
Indeed, despite domestic resistance, the PBOC must raise nominal interest rates so that they are in line with structural inflation.	事实上，即便面临国内阻力，中国人民银行也需要提高名义利率才能适应中国存在结构性通胀的现实。
Such a move would deter excessive investment in productive capacity, and ease the implementation of a more flexible exchange-rate regime.	这一举措既能抑制在产能方面的过度投资，又可推动实施更有弹性的汇率机制。 但更高的利率会吸引热钱。
At the same time, one need only recall the damage that unregulated carry trades wrought on Asian economies in the 1990’s to understand why China must erect barriers to protect its domestic markets from inflows of hot money.	只需回顾上世纪九十年代使亚洲经济受灾的无监管利差交易，人们就能理解为什么中国必须设置适当的管控机制以防止热钱流入其国内市场。
The alternative to this price-oriented approach – continued dependence on the quota system – would incur considerable administrative expenses, efficiency losses, and social costs stemming from rent-seeking and corruption.	而这些替代市场导向价格机制的管控机措施往往需要持续依赖配额制度，并会产生相当大的行政费用、效率损失及源于寻租和腐败的社会成本。
Much like the quota system of 30 years ago, the current reliance on quotas is unsustainable in the long term.	正如三十年前的配额制度一样，当前对配额的依赖长期来看是不可持续的。
To manage exorbitant demand for financial and physical assets, China’s leaders must address its root cause: the low cost of capital.	要消除对金融及实物资产的过度需求，中国领导人必须解决其根本问题，即资本的价格太低。
Doing so will require maintaining some capital-account control, while raising interest rates to market-clearing levels.	这样做需要将利率提高到市场均衡水平，同时继续实施适当的资本账户管制。
This, not the unsustainable imposition of quotas, is the real monetary-policy challenge facing China today.	当今中国面对的真正货币政策挑战是如何提高利率至市场均衡水平，适当控制资本账户以便资本有序流动，从而创造条件来结束不可持续的配额制度。
	
Why Cutting Carbon Emissions is not Enough	为什么仅仅削减碳排放是不够的
Twenty years ago, governments adopted the Montreal Protocol, a treaty to protect the Earth’s ozone layer from emissions of destructive chemicals.	就在二十年前，为了保护地球的臭氧层不受有害气体排放的侵袭，全球各国政府共同签署了《蒙特利尔议定书 》 。
Few could have foreseen how far-reaching that decision would prove to be.	而当年只有少数人能预见到这个决定的意义是如此深远。
The Protocol explicitly aimed at phasing-out substances such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) – found in products such as refrigerators, foams, and hairsprays – in order to repair the thin gassy-shield that filters out the sun’s harmful, ultra-violet rays.	该议定书明确要求逐步减少诸如氟利昂（CFCs）这类物质的使用 — — 这类物质通常存在于冰箱，塑料泡沫和头发定型水当中 — — 以修补过滤阳光中有害紫外线的薄薄臭氧层。
By 2010, close to 100 ozone-depleting substances, including CFCs, will have been phased-out globally.	到2010年时，将有近100种类似氟利昂这类的破坏臭氧层物质在全球范围内遭到淘汰。
Without the decisions taken 20 years ago, atmospheric levels of ozone-depleting substances would have increased ten-fold by 2050.	试想如果没有20年前所做的决定，大气中的破坏臭氧层的物质含量将在2050年时达到1989年的十倍。
This could have led to up to 20 million additional cases of skin cancer and 130 million more cases of eye cataracts, not to speak of damage to human immune systems, wildlife, and agriculture.	这意味着额外增加2000万皮肤癌病例以及1.3亿白内障患者，更别提对人类免疫系统，野生动物和农业所造成的危害了。
But this is only part of the story that we celebrate on the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer (September 16).	但这只是我们庆祝世界臭氧层保护日（9月16日）其中一部分原因。
Over the past two years, it has been established that the Montreal Protocol has also spared humanity a significant level of climate change, because the gases that it prohibits also contribute to global warming.	在过去两年来，据估计《蒙特利尔议定书》同样为人类免除了气候变化导致的大量灾害，因为议定书所禁止的气体同样也是全球变暖的始作俑者。
Indeed, a study in 2007 calculated the climate mitigation benefits of the ozone treaty as totalling the equivalent of 135 billion tons of CO2 since 1990, or a delay in global warming of 7-12 years.	事实上，根据2007年进行的一项研究估算，这项臭氧层保护条约所带来的气候红利等同于自1990年以来少排放了1350亿吨二氧化碳，直接将全球变暖效应的到来延缓了7-12年。
So the lessons learned from the Montreal Protocol may have wider significance.	因此我们从《蒙特利尔议定书》中得到的经验的将具有更广泛的意义。
Scientists now estimate that somewhere close to 50% of climate change is being caused by gases and pollutants other than CO2, including nitrogen compounds, low-level ozone formed by pollution, and black carbon.	目前科学家估计约有50%的气候变化是由二氧化碳以外的各种气体和污染物所导致的，其中包括一些氮化合物，由污染产生的低空臭氧以及炭黑。
Of course, a degree of scientific uncertainty about some of these pollutants’ precise contribution to warming remains. But they certainly play a significant role.	当然，这些物质到底对全球变暖影响多大依然有待科学证实，但毫无疑问的是，它们也是极为重要的元凶。
Meanwhile, many of these gases need to be curbed because of their wider environmental impact on public health, agriculture, and the planet’s multi-trillion dollar ecosystems, including forests.	而与此同时，许多这类物质都必须受到限制，因为它们对公众健康，农业以及地球上价值数万亿美元的生态系统（包括森林）都具有广泛的环境影响。
Consider black carbon, a component of the soot emissions from diesel engines and the inefficient burning of biomass cooking stoves that is linked to 1.6 million to 1.8 million premature deaths annually as a result of indoor exposure and 800,000 as a result of outdoor exposure.	比如说炭黑，这种来源于柴油机废气以及家庭煮食燃料不充分燃烧的物质每年都导致160~180万宗室内死亡案例和80万宗室外死亡案例。
Black carbon, which absorbs heat from the sun, also accounts for anywhere from 10% to more than 45% of the contribution to global warming, and is also linked to accelerated losses of glaciers in Asia, because the soot deposits darken, ice making it more vulnerable to melting.	而这种从阳光中吸收热量的物质同时也与10%~45%的全球变暖效应有关，并导致了亚洲地区的冰川加速融化，因为这些沉积物的逐渐堆积使冰变得更黑，也更容易融化。
One study estimates that 26% of black carbon emissions are from stoves for heating and cooking, with more than 40% of this amount from wood burning, roughly 20% from coal, 19% from crop residues, and 10% from dung.	有研究估计26%的炭黑是由家庭生火取暖和烹饪所产生的，其中超过40%来自于烧柴，约20%来自烧煤，19%来自秸秆，10%来自家畜粪便的燃烧。
Some companies have developed stoves that use passive air flows, better insulation, and 60% less wood to reduce black carbon emissions by around 70%.	对此一些企业已经研发出采用喷气助燃技术的炉子，炉膛内部也更加保温隔热，可减少木柴使用量达60 % ， 最终直接减少70%炭黑的产生。
Mass introduction of such stoves could deliver multiple green-economy benefits.	而这类产品的大规模推广将使人们获得来自绿色经济的多方面好处。
While CO2 can remain in the atmosphere for centuries, other pollutants, including black carbon and ozone, remain for relatively periods – days, weeks, months, or years – so that reducing or ending emissions promises almost immediate climate benefits.	而虽然二氧化碳可以在大气中存在数百年，但包括炭黑和臭氧在内其他污染物却只能存在一段时间 — — 数天，数周，数月或者是几年 — — 因此减少或者终止这类物质的排放所获得的好处几乎是立竿见影的。
The international community’s over-arching concern must be to seal a serious and significant deal at the United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen in December to curtail C02 emissions and assist vulnerable countries to adapt.	国际社会压力巨大的关注之声迫切要求在12月于哥本哈根召开的联合国气候峰会上通过一个严肃且意义重大的二氧化碳减排条约，并协助某些成为众矢之的国家举手同意。
If the world also is to deploy all available means to combat climate change, emissions of all substances that contribute to it must be scientifically evaluated and urgently addressed.	而如果全世界要用尽一切手段去对抗气候变化的话，那么所有上述相关气体的排放也都必须得到科学评价，并予以立刻处理。
	
Human Nature and the Ethical Life	人性和道德生活
NEW YORK – Does human nature exist?	发自纽约 — — 人性究竟是否存在？
The answer has implications for anyone concerned about ethics.	这个问题的答案对任何关注道德的人都有影响。
In an era defined by amoral political leadership and eroding social values, thinking about the essence of humanity has never been more important.	在一个由不道德政治领导以及堕落社会价值观所界定的时代，对人类本质的思考也变得史无前例那么重要。
The philosophical concept of “human nature” has a long history.	“人性”的哲学概念源远流长。
In Western culture, its study began with Socrates in the fifth century BCE, but it was Aristotle who argued that human nature was characterized by unique attributes – particularly, people’s need to socialize and our ability to reason.	在西方文化中，对它的研究始于公元前五世纪的苏格拉底，而随后的亚里士多德认为人性具有诸多独特的属性 — — 特别是人们的社交需求以及推理能力。
For the Stoics of Hellenistic Greece, human nature was what gave life meaning and contributed to their embrace of cosmopolitanism and equality.	对于活跃在公元前 4 至前 1 世纪希腊的斯多葛派来说，是人性赋予了生命意义，并促使他们去接受世界大同和平等的思想。
Ancient Chinese philosophers like Confucius and Mencius believed human nature was innately good, while Xunzi thought it was evil and lacked a moral compass.	像孔子和孟子这样的中国古代哲学家认为人性本善，而荀子则认为人性本恶且缺乏道德指引。
In the Judeo-Christian-Islamic traditions, human nature is fundamentally corrupted by sin, but can be redeemed by embracing God, in whose image we have been created.	在犹太-基督教-伊斯兰传统理论中，人性充满着原罪，但可以通过侍奉上帝来得到救赎，而上帝正是依据他自己的形象创造了我们人类。
Modern Western philosophers, writing in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, expanded on these ideas.	十七和十八世纪的现代西方哲学家扩展了这些观点。
The English philosopher Thomas Hobbes argued that our natural state leads to a life that is “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short,” which is why we need a strong, centralized political authority (the so-called Leviathan).	英国哲学家托马斯·霍布斯（Thomas Hobbes）认为，我们的自然状态会导致一个“孤独、贫穷、肮脏，野蛮且短暂”的人生，这就是为什么我们需要一个强大且中央集权的政治权威（也就是所谓的利维坦 ） 。
By contrast, Jean-Jacques Rousseau believed that human nature is malleable, but that our original state was one without reason, language, or community.	相比之下，让-雅克·卢梭（Jean-Jacques Rousseau）认为人性是可塑的，但我们在原始状态下不存在理性，语言或社群。
He concluded that the mismatch between our early condition and modern civilization is at the root of our unhappiness, advocating a literal return to nature.	他认为我们之所以感觉不快乐，正是因为我们的初始状态与现代文明其实是不匹配的，因此主张完全回归自然。
David Hume, always sensible and moderate, proposed that humans are characterized by a combination of altruism and selfishness, and that such a combination can be partially molded for the better (or worse) by culture.	而总是明智而温和的大卫·休谟（David Hume）则提出人类是利他主义和自私的结合体，这种组合可以通过文化来部分地向着更好（或更遭的）方向塑造。
Charles Darwin’s work in the mid-1800s made many of the early “essentialist” views of human nature untenable.	然而查尔斯·达尔文（Charles Darwin）在19世纪中期的研究使许多早期的“本质主义”人性观无以为继。
The idea that humans had a small set of characteristics that only humans possess was at odds with the slow, gradual pace of Darwinian evolution.	那种认为人类拥有少量独有特征的理念与达尔文进化论缓慢，渐进的步伐发生了冲突。
While Homo sapiens evolved as a particular species of primate, there are no clean breaks between our biology and that of other species.	虽然智人是作为一种特殊的灵长类动物进行进化，但我们在生物学上其他物种之间并不是完全割裂的。
So the philosophical debate over human nature rages on, updated with the findings of biology.	于是关于人性的哲学辩论一直延续了下来，并随着生物学的发现而不断更新。
Today, some philosophers interpret Rousseau and Darwin to mean that human nature itself is nonexistent, and that while biology may constrain the body, it does not restrict our minds or our volition.	今天一些哲学家对卢梭和达尔文进行解读，认为人性本身是不存在的，而虽然生物学可能限制了我们的身体，但它并不能限制我们的思想或意志。
Evolutionary psychologists and even some neuroscientists say that is nonsense.	进化心理学家甚至某些神经科学家都认为这是无稽之谈。
The message they take from Darwin (and partly from Rousseau) is that we are maladaptive in a modern context – basically, Pleistocene apes who find themselves equipped with mobile phones and nuclear weapons.	他们从达尔文（部分来自卢梭）得到的信息是，我们对现代环境是适应不良的 — — 基本上我们就是一帮发现自己配备了移动电话和核武器的更新世猿人。
As an evolutionary biologist and philosopher of science, my view is that human nature certainly exists, but that it is not based on an “essence” of any kind.	作为一名进化生物学家和科学哲学家，我认为人性当然存在，但它并非基于任何一种“本质 ” 。
Rather, our species, just like any other biological species, is characterized by a dynamic and evolving set of traits that are statistically typical for our lineage but neither present in every member nor absent from every other species.	相反，我们的物种 — — 就像任何其他生物物种一样 — — 其特征是具备一组动态和进化的特质，这些特质在我们的谱系中具有统计学上的典型特征，但既不是必定存在于每个人类成员身上，也不排除会在所有其他物种身上出现。
Why does any of this matter to someone who is not a scientist or a philosopher?	为什么一个非科学家或哲学家的人来说，这又有什么关系呢？
There are at least two good reasons that I can think of. One is personal; the other is political.	对此至少有两个很好的理由浮现在我脑际：一个是个人的；另一个是政治上的。
First, how we interpret human nature has broad implications for ethics, in the ancient Greco-Roman sense of the study of how we should live our lives.	首先，我们对人性的解释会对道德产生广泛影响，这在古希腊罗马的语境上就是研究我们应该如何生活。
Someone who holds a Judeo-Christian-Islamic view of human nature is naturally going to worship God and follow the guidance of religious commandments.	拥有犹太教-基督教-伊斯兰人性观的人自然会崇拜上帝并遵循宗教诫命的指导。
By contrast, someone adopting an existentialist philosophy along the lines of Jean-Paul Sartre or Simone de Beauvoir might believe that because “existence precedes essence,” we are radically free to shape our lives according to our own choices, and do not need God to help us along.	相比之下，那些赞成让-保罗·萨特（Jean-Paul Sartre）或西蒙娜·德·波伏娃（Simone de Beauvoir）存在主义哲学学说的人可能会认为，因为“存在先于本质 ” ， 我们根据自己的选择完全自由地塑造生活，并不需要上帝出手相助。
Moreover, views on human nature affect views on ethics.	此外，对人性的看法也会影响对道德的看法。
And today, our ethics are a mess.	而我们当今的道德状况简直是一团糟。
One recent study in the United States called Donald Trump’s presidency the “most unethical” in American history, while Gallup’s annual survey of US attitudes toward morality suggests a steady erosion of social mores.	最近在美国进行的一项研究称特朗普的总统任期是美国历史上“最不道德的 ” ， 而盖洛普对美国对道德态度的年度调查显示，社会习俗正不断受到侵蚀。
If we all took a moment to consider where we stood on the debate about human nature, we might gain valuable insight into our own beliefs – and by extension, the beliefs of others.	如果我们都能花一点时间去考虑我们在人性论辩中的立场，我们可能会对自身的信念 — — 以及其他人的信念 — — 增添一些宝贵的见解。
Personally, I lean toward the naturalistic ethics of the Stoics, for whom human nature constrains and suggests – but does not rigidly determine – what we can and should do.	就个人而言，我倾向于斯多葛学派的自然主义伦理，对他们来说人性约束并指引着 — — 但并不是严格地决定 — — 我们能够和应该做些什么。
But regardless of one’s religious or philosophical leanings, reflecting on who we are – biologically and otherwise – is a good way to take more ownership of our actions.	但无论一个人的宗教或哲学倾向如何，对“我们是谁”的反思 — — 无论是在生物学还是其他方面 — — 都是一种更好地掌控自身行为的好方法。
Needless to say, there are many among us who could benefit from such an exercise.	毋庸置疑，我们中间许多人都可以从这种方法中受益。
	
The Centrists Cannot Hold	中间道路不可行
WASHINGTON – In most advanced democracies, a large center-right party competes with a large center-left party.	华盛顿—在大部分发达民主国家，都是一个中右翼大党和一个中左翼大党在竞争。
Of course, the extent to which an electoral system favors large parties – by having high popular-vote thresholds to enter parliament, or through winner-take-all constituencies – affects the degree of political fragmentation.	当然，选举制度有利于大党的程度 — — 通过议会普选高门槛，或通过选区赢者通吃制 — — 影响着政治碎片化的程度。
But, by and large, the developed democracies are characterized by competition between large parties on the center left and center right.	但是，总的来说，发达民主国家的特征是中左翼大党和中右翼大党竞争。
What, then, are true centrists like Mario Monti, Italy’s respected technocratic prime minister, to do?	那么，像意大利广受尊进的技术官僚型总理蒙蒂这样的真正中间派能做些什么呢？
To be sure, regional and ethnic allegiances play a greater role in some places in Europe – for example, Scotland, Belgium, and Catalonia – but far more so in emerging countries, where political cleavages also reflect specific post-colonial circumstances and often the legacy of single-party rule.	诚然，宗教和血统忠诚度在欧洲某些地方（如苏格兰、比利时和加泰罗尼亚）具有极重要的作用，但这些因素在新兴国家更加重要，那里的政治分裂局面也反映了各自的后殖民时代环境，并且通常属于一党执政的遗留问题。
Nonetheless, even in “emerging market” democracies, such as Chile, Mexico, South Korea, and India, a left-right cleavage plays an important role – while those who claim the political center generally remain weak.	尽管如此，即使是智利、墨西哥、韩国和印度这样的“新兴市场”民主国家，左右对立也扮演着重要角色，而宣布走中间道路的政客往往结果不佳。
The British Liberal Democrats, for example, have tried for decades to become a strong centrist third party, without success.	比如，英国自由民主党几十年来都在寻求成为强大的中间派第三大当，但从未成功。
While the political vocabulary in the United States is different, the Democratic Party, since Franklin Roosevelt’s presidency, is indeed a center-left force, the Republican Party occupies the right, and no other significant party exists.	尽管美国的政治观念有所不同，但民主党自富兰克林·罗斯福以来便是事实上的中左派，而共和党代表右翼，此外再无第三个主要党派出现。
In France and Germany, there is more fragmentation.	法国和德国的情况更加复杂。
Politics is still dominated by a large center-left party and a large center-right party, but smaller groups – some claiming the center and others the right and left extremes – challenge them to various degrees.	政坛主导者仍是中左翼大党和中右翼大党各一，但小党派 — — 走中间道路者有之，走极右和极左道路者亦有之 — — 能够形成不同程度的挑战。
In some countries, the “Greens” have their own identity, close to the left; but, despite remarkable progress in Germany, they remain unable to reach the electoral size of the large center-right and center-left parties.	在一些国家 ， “ 绿党”有着自己的身份，与左派关系密切；但是，尽管绿党在德国进步明显，他们仍无法撼动中右翼和中左翼大党在选举中的地位。
Variations of this basic structure exist in Spain, Portugal, Greece, Turkey, and the Nordic countries.	西班牙、葡萄牙、希腊、土耳其和北欧国家都存在各自不同的这一基本结构。
The situation is particularly interesting in Italy, where Monti, having decided to contest the upcoming general election, has had to position himself on the right (which he signaled by attending a gathering of the leaders of Europe’s center-right parties).	意大利的情况特别有意思，决定参加即将到来的大选的蒙蒂不得不将自己定位为右翼（他参加了欧洲中右翼党派领袖的聚会，以此可知他的立场 ） 。
He and former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi are now fighting for space on the right, with the center-left Democrats leading in the polls.	他和��总理贝卢斯科尼现在正在争夺右翼空间，而在民调中领先的是中左翼民主党。
There are at least four differences between center-right and center-left approaches to social and economic challenges.	就社会和经济挑战观点而言，中右翼和中左翼至少有四个不同点。
The right has greater confidence in markets to allocate resources and provide appropriate incentives; favors private consumption over public goods; is minimally concerned with economic inequality; and tends to be more nationalistic and less optimistic about international cooperation.	右翼对市场配置资源和提供合适激励的能力抱有更大信心；他们支持私人消费甚于公共品；他们不太担心经济不平等；对于国际合作，他们更倾向于民主主义，更少乐观主义。
The left, by contrast, believes that markets, particularly financial markets, need considerable government regulation and supervision to function well; gives greater weight to public goods (for example, parks, a clean environment, and mass-transit systems); seeks to reduce economic inequality, believing that it undermines democracy and the sense of fairness that is important to well-being; and is more willing to pursue international cooperation as a means to secure peace and provide global public goods, such as climate protection.	相反，左翼认为市场，特别是金融市场，需要政府的大规模监管和监督才能良好运转；他们更重视公共品（比如公园、清洁的环境和公交系统 ） ； 他们寻求降低经济不平等程度，认为不平等性破坏民主和对福祉至关重要的公正感；他们更愿意追求国际合作，将它视为确保和平、提供全球公共品（如气候保护）的方法。
When looking at actual economic policies as they have evolved over decades, we see that they always combine center-right and center-left elements.	在回顾几十年来的实际经济政策演化时，我们看到它们总是结合了中右翼和中左翼的元素。
Repeated financial crises have tempered even the right’s faith in unregulated markets, while the left has become more realistic and cautious about state planning and bureaucratic processes.	金融危机的反复发生让右翼对不受管制的市场的信念也有所动摇，而左翼对国家计划和官僚主义程序变得更加现实和谨慎。
Likewise, the choice between privately consumed and publicly consumed “goods” is often blurred, as politicians tend to reinforce citizens’ understandable tendency to demand public goods while rejecting the taxes needed to pay for them.	类似地，私人消费和公共消费“商品”之间的选择通常也是模糊的，政客总是强化公民要求公共品同时又拒绝为此纳税的倾向（这一倾向倒是不难理解 ） 。
As income inequality has increased – dramatically in some countries, such as the US – it is moving to the forefront of the debate, reinforcing the traditional political divide.	随着收入不平等性的加剧 — — 某些国家收入不平等性在急剧加剧，比如美国 — — 该问题也逐渐成为争论的焦点，加深了传统政治分歧。
Nonetheless, the center right and the center left are arguing about the degree of redistribution, not about the need for some progressivity in taxes and transfers.	尽管如此，中右翼和中左翼争论的的再分配的程度，而不是税收和转移支付所需要的一定的累进性。
Both also agree on the need for international cooperation in an increasingly interdependent world, with differences mainly concerning how much effort to spend on it.	双方都同意，在一个日渐相互依赖的世界中，国际合作是十分必要的，而分歧之处主要在于应该为此付出多大努力。
So, given that differences in policies as they are implemented have become largely a matter of degree, why do centrist parties remain weak?	那么，既然左右两翼所实施的政策的分歧点大体上只在于程度，为何中间道路党派仍如此弱势？
Why have they failed to unite moderates on both sides of the ideological divide?	为什么他们不能团结意识形态对立的两面的温和派？
One reason is that only a minority of any population is active politically.	一个原因在于在任何社会，都只有少数人是政治活跃的。
Active party members hold more ideologically consistent views – and hold them more strongly – than most of those who are politically less engaged, giving activists disproportionate influence in the political process.	与政治上不太参与的成员相比，活跃的党派成员持有更彻底的意识形态，立场也更坚定，这使得活跃者对政治进程的影响是巨大的。
After all, more nuanced ideas and policy proposals are relatively difficult to propagate effectively enough to generate broad and enthusiastic popular support.	毕竟，相对而言，模棱两可的观点和政策主张更难以有效宣传，从而获得广泛热情的群众支持。
But there also really are fundamental differences in values and economic philosophies, as well as in economic interests, leading to a fairly consistent positioning of voters on the right or left.	但在价值观和经济学方面，也确实存在根本性分歧，经济利益亦然，这导致选民们长期支持右翼或左翼。
Disagreement may lead to compromises, but that does not change the underlying differences in starting positions.	分歧可能带来妥协，但这并不改变一开始的根本性分歧。
It is probably a good thing that structured competition between large center-right and center-left parties persists.	中右翼大党和中左翼大党的持续结构性竞争或许是件好事。
Such parties can help to integrate the extremes into the political mainstream, while facilitating alternation in power, which is essential to any democracy’s dynamism; a system in which a large centrist party remained permanently in power would be far less desirable.	这一党派之争有助于将极端分子纳入政治主流，同时也有助于权力变换，而后者是任何民主国家政治动态的基石；中间道路大党长期掌权的体系要差得多。
Those, like Monti, who want to mount a challenge from the center, however personally impressive they may be, have steep obstacles to overcome, and for good reasons.	像蒙蒂这样的试图站在中间道路上发动挑战者，不管个人魅力多么强，要想脱颖而出都面临着艰难险阻，而这样的安排有着充分的道理。
	
Why Democracy Requires Trusted Experts	为什么民主政体需要值得信赖的专家
PARIS – Last month, I wrote a commentary asking why voters in the United Kingdom supported leaving the European Union, defying the overwhelming weight of expert opinion warning of the major economic costs of Brexit.	巴黎 — — 上个月，我写过一篇评论质疑英国选民为什么不顾多数专家脱欧将付出惨重经济代价的警告而支持脱欧？
I observed that many voters in the UK and elsewhere are angry at economic experts.	据我观察，英国和其他国家的许多选民在经济专家面前感到异常愤怒。
They say that the experts failed to foresee the financial crisis of 2008, put efficiency first in their policy advice, and blindly assumed that the losers from their policy prescriptions could be compensated in some unspecified way.	他们说专家未能预见到2008年金融危机、一贯在政策建议中奉行效率第一的原则、并且盲目假设因其施政方略而受损的民众能够以某种不确定的方式得到补偿。
I argued that experts should be humbler and more attentive to distributional issues.	我认为专家应当放低身段，进一步关注分配问题。
The piece elicited far more comments from readers than any of my others.	那篇文章所得到的评论比我其他所有评论文章都多。
Their reactions mostly confirm the anger I had noted.	评论者的反应基本证实了我刚刚提到的愤怒。
They regard economists and other experts as isolated from and indifferent to the concerns of ordinary people; driven by an agenda that does not coincide with that of citizens; often blatantly wrong, and therefore incompetent; biased in favor of, or simply captured by, big business and the financial industry; and naive – failing to see that politicians select analyses that suit their ends and disregard the rest.	他们认为经济学家和其他专家远离普通民众，不关心民众疾苦；他们的目的不同于普通民众；他们常大错特错，因此根本不称职；他们偏袒大企业和金融业，或者成为利益集团的俘虏；他们天真幼稚 — — 没有看到政客会选择与其自身目标相符的分析并无视其他。
Experts, said some, are also guilty of fracturing society by segmenting the debate into myriad narrow, specialized discussions.	有人说，专家将辩论分解成无数狭隘、专业探讨的做法客观上要为社会的分裂负责。
Remarkably, I also received comments from professionals in the natural sciences who said that citizens’ growing distrust of experts was pervasive in their disciplines, too.	值得注意的是，我还收获了来自自然科学专业人士的评论，表示民众对专家信任度越来越低的现象在他们的学科领域也普遍存在着。
Scientific views in fields like energy, climate, genetics, and medicine face widespread popular rejection.	诸如能源、气候、遗传学和医学领域的科学观念正面对民众越来越普遍的抵制。
In the United States, for example, a Pew Research survey found that 67% of adults think that scientists lack a clear understanding about the health effects of genetically modified organisms.	比方说在美国，某皮尤研究调查发现67%的成年人认为科学家对转基因生物造成的健康影响缺乏清醒的认识。
Mistrust of GMOs is even higher in Europe.	欧洲对转基因生物的不信任度甚至超过美国。
Whereas overall support for science remains strong, many citizens believe that it is manipulated by special interests, and on some issues, the common view departs from the established evidence.	虽然科学的总体支持率依然强劲，但很多民众认为科学研究受特殊利益集团的操纵，并且在某些问题上，人们的普遍观点与已经掌握的证据不符。
This divide between experts and citizens is a cause for deep concern.	这种专家和民众之间的鸿沟非常值得关注。
Representative democracy is based not only on universal suffrage, but also on reason.	普选加理智构成代议制民主的基础。
Ideally, deliberations and votes result in rational decisions that use the current state of knowledge to deliver policies that advance citizens’ wellbeing.	理想情况下，审议和表决程序能够促进运用目前所掌握的知识制定出推进公民福祉的理性决策。
This requires a process in which experts – whose competence and honesty are trusted – inform decision-makers of the available options for meeting voters’ stated preferences.	这需要能力和诚信度都值得信赖的专家把满足选民明确偏好的备选方案告知决策者。
Citizens are unlikely to be satisfied if they believe that experts are imposing their own agenda, or are captured by special interests.	如果认定专家另有目的或服务于特殊利益集团则不太可能获得民众满意的结果。
Distrust of experts fuels distrust of democratically elected governments, if not of democracy itself.	对专家的不信任加剧了对民选政府、甚至民主本身的不信任。
Why is there such a divide between experts and society?	专家和社会之间为何存在如此巨大的鸿沟？
Every country has had its own series of high-profile public health or safety scandals.	所有国家都存在著名的公共健康或安全丑闻。
Experts have been guilty of sloppiness and conflicts of interest.	专家们往往态度草率，并可能存在利益冲突。
Hard-won reputations have been quickly lost.	来之不易的信誉就这样迅速丧失了。
But critics often fail to recognize that science involves more – and more stringent – scrutiny than, say, business or government.	但批评者却往往未能意识到科学涉及比企业或政府更繁琐 — — 也��严格的审查。
It is actually the standard-bearer of good practices concerning the validation of analyses and the discussion of policy proposals.	在涉及到分析验证和政策建议探讨等领域，科学在现实中才堪称优秀惯例的旗手。
Errors regularly occur in academia, but they are more swiftly and systematically corrected than in other fields.	学术界经常会犯错误，但其纠正错误的能力却远比其他领域更迅速、也更系统。
The collective nature of scientific validation also provides guarantees against capture by special interests.	科学验证的集体性质同样保证了科学研究不受特殊利益群体的左右。
The problem may, in fact, be deeper than the common grievances against experts suggest.	事实上，问题可能比对专家意见的普遍不满更为复杂。
A few decades ago, it was widely assumed that progress in mass education would gradually bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and popular belief, thereby contributing to a more serene and more rational democracy.	数十年前，人们普遍认为全民教育的进步将逐步弥合科学知识和民众信仰之间的鸿沟，进程促成一种更平静、也更理性的民主。
The evidence is that it has not.	但事实证明科学并没有促进民主。
As Gerald Bronner, a French sociologist, has convincingly shown, education neither increases trust in science nor diminishes the attraction of beliefs or theories that scientists regard as utter nonsense.	法国社会学家杰拉德·布朗纳令人信服地表明教育既未提升对科学的信任度、也未导致被科学家视为纯粹胡言乱语的信仰和理论的魅力有任何削弱。
On the contrary, more educated citizens often resent being told by experts what science regards as truth.	相反，教育程度更高的民众往往厌恶专家告诉他们真理是什么。
Having had access to knowledge, they feel empowered enough to criticize the cognoscenti and develop views of their own.	因为自己掌握知识，他们自视有能力批评专家并得出自己的见解。
Climate change – which the scientific community overwhelmingly regards it as a major threat – is a case in point.	被科学界普遍视为重大威胁的气候变化就是个很好的例子。
According to a 2015 Pew Research survey, the three countries where concern is the weakest are the US, Australia, and Canada, whereas the three in which it is the strongest are Brazil, Peru, and Burkina Faso.	2015年一份皮尤研究中心调查显示最不关心气候变化的三个国家是美国、澳大利亚和加拿大，而最关心的三个国家则是巴西、秘鲁和布基纳法索。
Yet average years of schooling are 12.5 for the first group and six for the second.	但前面一组平均受教育年限为12.5年，而后面一组则仅有6年。
Evidently, education alone is not the reason for this difference in perception.	显而易见，教育本身并不是形成这种认知差异的理由。
If the problem is here to stay, we had better do more to address it.	如果这个问题长期存在，我们最好能尽力解决它。
First, we need more discipline on the part of the community of experts.	首先，我们需要专家团体加强自律。
The intellectual discipline that characterizes research is often lacking in policy discussions.	标志着研究活动的学术自律往往在政策讨论中非常缺乏。
Humility, rigorous procedures, the prevention of conflicts of interest, an ability to acknowledge mistakes and, yes, punishment of fraudulent behavior are needed to regain citizens’ trust.	谦虚谨慎、程序严密、防止利益冲突、善于认错以及处罚欺诈行为才能重塑民众的信任。
Second, there is a case for revising curricula to equip future citizens with the intellectual tools they will need to distinguish between fact and fiction.	其次，我们应当修改课程为未来的民众提供辨别虚构和现实所需的智力工具。
Society has everything to gain from citizens whose minds are both less suspicious and more critical.	能够减少怀疑、加强批判性的民众可以让社会受益。
Finally, we need better venues for dialogue and informed debate.	最后，我们需要开展对话和知情辩论的更好的场所。
Serious magazines, general-interest journals, and newspapers traditionally filled the space between the ether of peer-reviewed journals and the deep sea of hoaxes; yet they all struggle to survive the digital revolution.	严肃杂志、题材广泛的期刊和报纸在传统上填补了同行评审期刊和各式骗局间的空间；但它们都力求在数字革命当中存活。
Other venues, perhaps new institutions, are needed to fill that space.	还需要其他场所，也许还有新的体制才能填满上述空间。
What is clear is that democracy cannot thrive if it is left empty.	有一点非常明确，那就是空洞的民主无法获得繁荣发展。
	
Emerging-Market Resilience	新兴市场的复苏能力
NEW YORK – With most of the world focused on economic instability and anemic growth in the advanced countries, developing countries, with the possible exception of China, have received relatively little attention.	发自纽约 — — 全球大多数人都把注意力放在了发达国家的经济不稳和增长匮乏之上，而发展中国家（或许除了中国之外）所得到的关注则相对较少。
But, as a group, emerging-market economies have been negatively affected by the recent downturn in developed countries.	但作为一个群体，新兴市场经济体遭受了最近发达国家经济下滑的负面影响。
Can they rebound on their own?	那么，这些国家又是否可以依靠自身的力量恢复过来呢？
The major emerging economies were the world’s main growth engines following the eruption of the financial crisis in 2008, and, to some extent, they still are.	几个大的新兴经济体在2008年金融危机爆发后成为了全球增长的主要引擎，而且至今在某种程度上依然如是。
But their resilience has always been a function of their ability to generate enough incremental aggregate demand to support their growth, without having to make up for a large loss of demand in developed countries.	但它们的复苏能力一直都体现在其创造足够新增总需求以支撑自身增长的能力上，并不需要去补足发达国家大量流失的需求。
A combination of negligible (or even negative) growth in Europe and a significant growth slowdown in the United States has now created that loss, undermining emerging economies’ exports.	这种流失是在欧洲的微小（或甚至负）增长以及美国增长大幅下滑的联合作用下形成的，也使新兴经济体的出口遭到了打击。
Europe is a major export destination for many developing countries, and is China’s largest foreign market.	欧洲既是许多发展中国家的主要出口目的地，更是中国的最大国外市场。
China, in turn, is a major market for final products, intermediate goods (including those used to produce finished exports), and commodities.	相应地，中国则是成品 ， （ 包括那些用来制成成品的）半成品和大宗商品的主要市场。
The ripple effect from Europe’s stalling economy has thus spread rapidly to the rest of Asia and beyond.	欧洲经济停滞的连锁反应也因此迅速扩散到了亚洲其他地区甚至更广大的区域。
Moreover, not only is the tradable sector of Japan’s economy highly vulnerable to a slowdown in China, but the recent conflict over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands raises the prospect of economic decoupling.	此外，不仅日本经济中的贸易部门极易受到中国经济放缓的影响，最近在尖阁列岛/钓鱼岛问题上的冲突也提升了经济减速的预期。
Apart from that, Japanese economic performance is set to remain weak, because the non-tradable side is not a strong growth engine.	除此之外，日本的经济表现必然疲软，因为其国内的非贸易部门并不是一个强劲的增长引擎。
The key questions for the world economy today, then, are how significant the growth slowdown will be, and how long it will last.	因此对于当前的世界经济来说，关键问题就是增长放缓的程度究竟有多大，并将持续多长时间。
With wise policy responses, the impact is likely to be relatively mild and short-lived.	通过明智的政策应对，这种影响是能够变得相对温和且短暂的。
One key issue clouding the future is trade finance.	笼罩着未来的一个关键事务就是贸易融资。
European banks, traditionally a major source of trade finance, have pulled back dramatically, owing to capital-adequacy problems caused by sovereign-debt capital losses and, in some cases, losses from real-estate lending.	传统上欧洲各大银行都是贸易融资的主要来源，但由于主权债务资本损失以及（在某些情况中）房产信贷上的损失所导致的资本充足率问题，而今却极度萎缩。
This vacuum could reduce trade flows even if demand were present.	即便需求已然存在，但这一真空状况也将减少贸易流。
In Asia, especially, filling the vacuum with alternative financing mechanisms has become a high priority.	尤其是在亚洲，用其他金融机制填补该真空已经成为了优先要考虑的问题。
In particular, although China’s tradable sector is highly exposed to developed economies, the government is likely to accept some short-run slowdown, rather than adopting potentially distorting stimulus measures.	特别是虽然中国的贸易部门受到了发达国家的极大影响，但政府也愿意接受一些短期的减速，而非采取一些可能引发混乱的刺激措施。
Given the risk of re-inflating asset bubbles, no one should expect a dramatic easing of credit of the type that followed the 2008 meltdown.	考虑到资产泡沫再度膨胀的风险，没有人会期望一个类似2008年经济重挫后的大幅度信贷宽松。
An accelerated public-investment program that avoids low-return projects is not out of the question.	一个排除了低回报项目的加速公共投资计划是在考虑范围之内。
But the best and most likely responses are those that accelerate domestic consumption growth by increasing household income, effectively deploy income from state-owned assets, and strengthen China’s social-security systems in order to reduce precautionary saving.	但最佳也是最可能的应对则是通过家庭收入增长，国有资产收入的有效分配，以及强化社会保障体系以减少预防性储蓄等方式来加速国内消费的增长。
Indeed, these are all key components of China’s recently adopted 12th Five-Year Plan.	事实上，这些都是中国最近“十二五”计划的关键组成部分。
Admittedly, China’s major systemic reforms await the country’s leadership transition, now expected in November.	众所周知，中国的重大系统性改革需要等到领导班子交接完毕之后才能启动，这意味着要在11月才能有所作为。
By most accounts, the pace of reform directed at expanding the market side of the economy needs to pick up quickly to achieve the ambitious economic and social goals of the next five years.	但在绝大多数情况下，旨在扩大经济中市场部分的改革路径需要迅速启动以满足未来五年极富雄心的经济和社会目标。
Some countries have bucked the global trend.	此外也一些国家逆市上扬。
Indonesia, for example, has experienced accelerating growth, with rising business and consumer confidence boosting investment to almost 33% of GDP.	例如印尼的增长就不断加速，不断增长的企业和消费者信心将投资推高到了占GDP近33%的水平。
Likewise, Brazil’s growth has been dented, but now looks set to recover.	同样，巴西的增长一度受挫，但如今似乎已经开始复苏。
Moreover, overall economic performance in Brazil masks an important fact: growth rates have been substantially higher among the country’s poorer citizens, and unemployment is declining.	此外，该国的总体经济表现掩盖了一个重要的事实：与贫穷市民有关的经济增长率较高，而失业率也正在下降。
The aggregate growth rate does not capture this inclusiveness, and thus understates the pace of economic and social progress.	总增长率并未反映出这类包容性，并因此低估了经济和社会进步的步伐。
The main challenge for Brazil is to increase its investment rate from 18% of GDP currently to closer to 25%, thereby sustaining rapid growth and economic diversification.	巴西所面对的主要挑战就是如何将其当前占GDP18%的投资比率提高到25 % ， 并以此支撑迅速增长以及经济的多样化。
Commodity dependence, even with the creation of considerable domestic value added, remains high.	该国目前对大宗商品的依赖 — — 即便已经创造了相当数额的国内增值 — — 依然较高。
Economic-growth rates in other systemically large countries, including Turkey and Mexico, have risen as well, despite European and US headwinds.	尽管欧美表现不佳，但其他系统性大国，比如土耳其和墨西哥的经济增长率都有所上升。
Many African countries, too, are showing a broad pattern of sound macroeconomic fundamentals, durable growth acceleration, economic diversification, and investor confidence.	许多非洲国家也表现出一个广泛的模式，包括良好的宏观经济规则，持久的加速增长，经济多样化以及高昂的投资者信心。
The outlook for India’s economy remains more uncertain.	印度经济远景的不确定更大。
While growth slowed recently from very high rates – owing to a combination of exposure to developed-country weakness, internal loss of reform momentum, and declining investor confidence – that trend appears to be reversing after recent decisive corrective moves by the government.	虽然经济增长最近从高位下滑 — — 这是发达国家危机的冲击，内部改革动力的流失以及投资者信心减弱的综合结果 — — 但这个趋势似乎在最近政府一连串果断纠正措施中得到了逆转。
The main question is whether India’s parliament will pass crucial legislation or remain paralyzed by hyper-partisan, scandal-fueled infighting.	主要的问题就是印度议会究竟能否通过关键的立法，还是依然在极端派系化且丑闻频出的内斗中继续僵持。
Combining this general picture with more general developing-country trends – rising incomes, rapid growth in middle classes, expanding trade and investment flows, bilateral and regional free-trade agreements, and a growing share of global GDP (roughly 50%) – these economies’ growth momentum should return relatively rapidly, over the next 1-2 years.	将这个大图景和更多发展中国家的总体趋势结合起来 — — 收入的提升，中产阶级的迅速增长，双边和多变自由贸易协定，以及经济总量占全球GDP份额的不断增长（大概50 % ） — — 这些经济体的增长动力应该会在未来一两年内实现相对较快的回归。
Most of the downside risk to this scenario lies in the systemically important economies of Europe, the US, and China.	这一情境中的大部分下滑风险都存在于欧洲，美国和中国等系统性重要的经济体内部。
To derail emerging economies’ growth momentum at this stage probably would require either an additional major demand shock from the advanced economies, or some kind of failure in China’s leadership transition that impedes systemic reform and affects the country’s growth.	如果在这个阶段挫伤新兴经济的增长动力的话，要么是发达经济体的需求又出现了一次额外的重挫，要么就是中国的政权交接出现了某种问题，阻碍了系统性改革并影响了国家经济的增长。
Notwithstanding low growth forecasts for the entire developed world, these systemic risks, taken individually and in combination, appear to be declining (though certainly not to the point that they can be dismissed).	尽管发达国家整体的增长预期较低，但这些系统性风险 — — 无论是单独出现还是同时爆发 — — 出现的可能性似乎都在降低（当然也没到可以被消除的地步 ） 。
On balance, then, the multispeed growth patterns of the past decade are likely to continue.	因此总的来说，过去十年的高速增长模式很可能将持续下去。
Even as the developed economies experience an extended period of below-trend growth, the emerging economies will remain an important growth engine.	即便发达经济体面临着一段低于平均增速的长时期，新兴经济体依然会是一个重要的增长引擎。
	
Why Did Economists Not Foresee the Crisis?	经济学家为何无法预测危机？
CHICAGO – At the height of the financial crisis, the Queen of England asked my friends at the London School of Economics a simple question, but one for which there is no easy answer: Why did academic economists fail to foresee the crisis?	发自芝加哥 — — 在经济危机最高峰之时，英女王伊丽莎白二世向我那些伦敦经济学院的友人们提出了一个简单却又无法轻易回答的问题：专业经济学家为何没能预测这场危机？
Several responses to that query exist.	对此其实有几种答案。
One is that economists lacked models that could account for the behavior that led to the crisis.	一是说经济学家缺少相关模型，因此也无法对导致本次危机的行为作出解释。
Another is that economists were blinkered by an ideology according to which a free and unfettered market could do no wrong.	另一种认为经济学家都被无限制自由市场的教条思想蒙住了眼睛，觉得这样的市场是不会出错的。
Finally, an answer that is gaining ground is that the system bribed economists to stay silent.	而最后一种逐渐流行的说法则是经济学家都收受了金融系统的好处，于是集体保持沉默。
In my view, the truth lies elsewhere.	在我看来，真相另有所在。
It is not true that we academics did not have useful models to explain what happened.	实际上，我们这些专业经济学家并不缺乏有用的模型去解释这些状况。
If you believe that the crisis was caused by a shortage of liquidity, we had plenty of models analyzing liquidity shortages and their effects on financial institutions.	如果你认为危机的成因是缺乏流动性，我们有一大堆模型可以分析流动性短缺及其对金融机构的影响。
If you believe that the blame lies with greedy bankers and unthinking investors, lulled by the promise of a government bailout, or with a market driven crazy by irrational exuberance, we had studied all this too, in great detail.	如果你觉得始作俑者是贪婪的银行家和盲从的投资者，是这些人在政府援助方案的包庇或是市场非理性繁荣的疯狂驱动下胡作非为，我们对此也有极为细致深入研究。
Economists even analyzed the political economy of regulation and deregulation, so we could have understood why some US politicians pushed the private sector into financing affordable housing, while others deregulated private finance.	经济学家们甚至分析了监管和去监管两者之间的政治经济效应，因此也深知为何某些美国政客极力推动私人部门发放住房贷款，另一些却着手去除对私人金融活动的监管。
Yet, somehow, we did not bring all this understanding to bear and collectively shout our warnings.	但让人困惑的是经济学家们竟没有将这些认识转化为结论，并集体发出警告。
Perhaps the reason was ideology: we were too wedded to the idea that markets are efficient, market participants are rational, and high prices are justified by economic fundamentals.	或许这样做的理由是与理念有关的：我们都过分固执地认为市场是有效的，市场参与者是理性的，而高价格是可以用经济法则来解释的。
But some of this criticism of “market fundamentalism” reflects a misunderstanding.	而某些对这种“市场原教旨主义”的批评则反映了一种错误的理解。
The dominant “efficient markets theory” says only that markets reflect what is publicly known, and that it is hard to make money off markets consistently – something verified by the hit that most investor portfolios took in the crisis.	当前主流的“有效市场管理论”只是说市场反映了公众所知的信息，也难以持续地从市场中赚钱 — — 我们从某些投资者在危机中遭重创的投资组合中可以发现这点。
The theory does not say that markets cannot plummet if the news is bad, or if investors become risk-averse.	但该理论可没有说市场在碰到坏消息或是投资者变得厌恶风险时不会大幅下挫。
Critics argue that the fundamentals were deteriorating in plain sight, and that the market (and economists) ignored it.	有批评认为经济法则的失效显而易见，但市场（以及经济学家）却对此视而不见。
But hindsight distorts analysis.	但这都是马后炮。
We cannot point to a lonely Cassandra like Robert Shiller of Yale University, who regularly argued that house prices were unsustainable, as proof that the truth was ignored.	我们不能单凭一个像耶鲁大学的罗伯特·席勒（此君一直认为高房价是无法维持的）那样的孤独预言家就认为真相被忽视了。
There are always naysayers, and they are often wrong.	凡事都有唱反调的人，而且这些人经常是错的。
There were many more economists who believed that house prices, though high, were unlikely to fall across the board.	相比之下，有更多的经济学家认为房价虽然很高，但却不可能全盘下跌。
Of course, these expectations could have been distorted by ideology – it is hard to get into the past minds of economists.	当然，这些预期都会被理念所扭曲 — — 但我们也无从追查经济学家们过去是如何思考的。
But there is a better reason to be skeptical of explanations relying on ideology. As a group, neither behavioral economists, who think that market efficiency is a joke, nor progressive economists, who distrust free markets, predicted the crisis.	而那些将原因单纯归咎于某种理念的解释也是站不住脚的，须知作为一个群体，无论是那些将市场效率视为笑话的行为经济学家；还是不相信自由市场的发展经济学家，都没能预测到这场危机。
Could it be corruption?	那么这其中是否还存在腐败呢？
Some academic economists consult for banks or rating agencies, give speeches to investor conferences, serve as expert witnesses, and carry out sponsored research.	有些专业经济学家在银行或评级机构担任顾问，在投资者讲座上发言，扮演专家证人的角色，还拿着别人的钱做研究。
It would be natural to suspect us of bias.	这令公众很自然地怀疑我们是否有偏袒之处。
The bias could be implicit: our worldview is shaped by what our friends in industry believe. Or it may be an explicit bias: an economist might write a report that is influenced by what a sponsor wants to hear, or give testimony that is purely mercenary.	同时这种偏向性可以是隐性的：我们的世界观就是由那些金融界友人的信仰塑造出来的；也可以是显性的：一个经济学家可能会撰写一份符合资助者心意的报告，或者纯粹为挣钱而发表证言。
There are enough instances of possible bias that the issue cannot be ignored.	有足够的事例可以证实这种潜在的偏向性，因此也无法忽视这一问题。
One remedy would be to ban all interaction between economists and the corporate world.	其中一个解决方案就是断绝经济学家与金融企业之间的所有联系。
But if economists were confined to the ivory tower, we might be unbiased, but we would also be ignorant of practicalities – and thus even less capable of predicting problems. One way to restore trust may be disclosure – for economists to declare a monetary interest in a particular analysis and, more generally, to explain who pays us.	但如果经济学家都被关在了象牙塔里，我们可能会变得客观，但却更加与实际情况脱节 — — 并因此更加无法预测危机，另一种恢复信心的方式则是信息披露制度 — — 比如说经济学家必须声明在某项特定分析中所获取的货币利益，或者更简单地说，告诉大家是谁给了我们钱。
A number of universities are moving in this direction.	事实上有一些大学已经开始推进这方面事务了。
But I believe that corruption is not the main reason that the profession missed the crisis.	但我相信腐败并非经济学家无法识别危机的主因。
Most economists have very little interaction with the corporate world, and these “unbiased” economists were no better at forecasting the crisis.	大多数经济学家都与企业交往甚少，而那些“不偏心的”经济学家也无法预测这场危机。
I would argue that three factors largely explain our collective failure: specialization, the difficulty of forecasting, and the disengagement of much of the profession from the real world.	在此我认为有三个因素能大概解释经济学家集体出错的原因：高度专业化，预测的难度，以及大部分经济学科与现实的脱节。
Like medicine, economics has become highly compartmentalized – macroeconomists typically do not pay attention to what financial economists or real-estate economists study, and vice versa.	跟医学一样，经济学也被划分成许多不同的门类 — — 宏观经济学家一般不会关注金融经济学家或地产经济学家究竟在干什么，反之亦然。
Yet, to see the crisis coming would have required someone who knew about each of these areas – just as it takes a good general practitioner to recognize an exotic disease.	但预测危机却需要对各个经济学领域都有所涉猎的人 — — 正如我们需要一个优秀的全科医师去辨认某种外来病一样。
Because the profession rewards only careful, well-supported, but necessarily narrow analysis, few economists try to span sub-fields.	由于该学科只崇尚细致，证据充分但也必然有些狭窄的研究，因此也只有少数的经济学家愿意在各细分领域之间进行跨界研究。
Even if they did, they would shy away from forecasting.	但即便他们这样做了，他们也会羞于预测。
The main advantage that academic economists have over professional forecasters may be their greater awareness of established relationships between factors.	专业经济学家相对于专业市场预测者的主要优势可能在于前者更容易意识到各因素之间已经建立的关联。
What is hardest to forecast, though, are turning points – when the old relationships break down.	而预测的最困难之处恰恰是转折点 — — 就是当旧有的关联破裂之时。
While there may be some factors that signal turning points – a run-up in short-term leverage and asset prices, for example, often presages a bust – they are not infallible predictors of trouble to come.	虽然有些因素会反映转折点的到来 — — 比如说短期金融杠杆和资产价格的上升通常预示着泡沫破裂 — — 但这不意味着危机就一定会爆发。
The meager professional rewards for breadth, coupled with the inaccuracy and reputational risk associated with forecasting, leads to disengagement for most academics. And it may well be that academic economists have little to say about short-term economic movements, so that forecasting, with all its errors, is best left to professional forecasters.	专业上对跨领域研究的轻视，再加上预测的低准确性以及可能给名誉带来的损失，都让大多数专业经济学家对预测敬而远之，也导致专业经济学家甚少对短期经济活动发表意见，因此预测这件动辄得咎的事情只好留给专业预测者去做了。
The danger is that disengagement from short-term developments leads academic economists to ignore medium-term trends that they can address.	但这也暴露了其中的危机：对短期经济发展状况的怠慢导致专业经济学家忽略了他们有资格发表意见的中期趋势。
If so, the true reason why academics missed the crisis could be far more mundane than inadequate models, ideological blindness, or corruption, and thus far more worrisome; many simply were not paying attention!	如果是这样的话，引发这些经济学家们误判危机的真正原因就不是不恰当模型，理念误区或者腐败这类高深的理由，而是一个更平淡无奇但也更令人忧心不已的事实：许多经济学家根本就没有关注与危机有关的一切！
	
Malala’s Revolution	马拉拉的革命
ISLAMABAD – The men who attempted to kill 14-year-old Malala Yousafzai on October 9 knew what she represented.	伊斯兰堡—在10月9日试图杀害14岁的马拉拉·尤萨夫扎伊（Malala Yousafzai）的人们知道她代表着什么。
Her active involvement since the age of eleven in campaigning for the rights of girls in her region to be educated was well known.	她从11岁就积极地参与了所在地区助长女生受教育权的活动，相当有名。
Malala’s efforts, while applauded by the West and some segments of Pakistani society, were deeply resented by the obscurantist forces that go by the name of the Taliban, which in Pakistan calls itself Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan.	马拉拉的努力受到了西方和巴基斯坦一部分人的赞扬，但被称为塔利班的反启蒙势力对她深恶痛绝。
Their choice of name is an ironic one, for Taliban, an Arabic word, means those seeking to be educated, whereas the Taliban’s principal aim is to keep Muslim societies backward so that they can be persuaded to adopt a seventh-century version of Islam.	他们巴基斯坦自称巴基斯坦塔利班（Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan ） ， 这是个奇怪的名字，因为“塔利班”这个阿拉伯词语的意思是寻求受教育，而塔利班的主旨是保持穆斯林社会的落后状况，以便说服他们接受17世纪的伊斯兰教义。
Education, particularly of women, stands in the way of achieving this goal.	教育特别是女性教育，是达到这一目的的障碍。
But the attack on Malala will, most likely, have an effect that is opposite to that intended by those who carried it out.	但对马拉拉的攻击的效果更可能与攻击者的本意背道而驰。
Several religious leaders joined the chorus of condemnation that followed the attack on Malala.	不少宗教领袖也齐声指责对马拉拉的供给。
In a sign of unity, a council of Sunni Muslim scholars in the eastern city of Lahore issued a fatwa, signed by 50 clerics, saying that the justifications cited by the girl’s attackers were “deviant” and had no basis in Islamic law.	东部城市拉合尔（Lahore）的一个逊尼派穆斯林学者委员会集体签名发布了一份教义裁决（共有50名牧师参与 ） ， 认为马拉拉攻击者的理由是“离经叛道的 ” ， 毫无伊斯兰法律依据。
The Taliban seem to have been taken aback by the public and media reaction to the attack.	塔利班似乎对公众和媒体对攻击事件的反应大吃一惊。
Dawn, Pakistan’s largest-circulation English-language newspaper, reported that Hakimullah Mehsud, the Pakistani Taliban’s leader, had ordered his foot soldiers to target media organizations in Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi, and Islamabad in response.	巴基斯坦发行量最大的英语报纸《黎明 》 （ Dawn）报道，巴基斯坦塔利班领袖马哈苏德（Hakimullah Mehsud）已要求其步兵将目标对准卡拉奇、拉合尔、拉瓦尔品第（Rawalpindi）和伊斯兰堡的媒体组织作为应对措施。
Several TV channels had been extremely critical of the Taliban’s assaults on Pakistani society.	不少电视台严厉地抨击塔里本对巴基斯坦社会造成的伤害。
The extremists wanted to silence the majority that was waking up to the existential threat that radical Islam poses to their country.	极端主义者想要堵住逐渐明白极端伊斯兰教对国家造成的威胁的大多数人的口。
There is a widespread belief that Pakistani women are doing poorly when it comes to obtaining education.	一个广为流传的观念是巴基斯坦女性在教育方面表现不佳。
That impression is correct to some extent.	这一印象在某种程度上是正确的。
The overall literacy rate for women is undoubtedly low – much lower than that for men.	毫无疑问，女性识字率很低，比男性低得多。
But male education and literacy in Pakistan is not very high, either.	但巴基斯坦男性受教育率和识字率也并不是很高。
Although Pakistan is a signatory to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, which include attainment of universal literacy for both boys and girls by 2015, the country is far from achieving the target, with literacy rates of 70% for boys and only 45% for girls in 2010.	尽管巴基斯坦是联合国千年发展目标的签署国（其中包括在2015年前让所有男孩和女孩识字的目标 ） ， 但该国距离达成目标还差得很远，2010年男孩识字率为70 % ， 女孩更是只有45 % 。
That said, over the 17-year period from 1993 to 2010, the number of girls enrolled in primary education increased from 3.7 million to 8.3 million.	在1993—2010年的17年中，入读小学的女孩数量从370万人增加至830万人。
This implies a rate of growth of 6.7% a year, about 2.5 times the rate of increase in the number of girls entering the primary-school age cohort.	这意味着每年7.6%的增幅，大约是进入小学就读年龄段女孩人数增长率的2.5倍。
But, even with this growth rate, girls still accounted for just 44.3% of the total number of enrolled students in 2010.	但是，尽管入学率增加迅速，但在2010年，女孩仍只占入学学生总数的44.3 % 。
It is in higher education that Pakistani women have made extraordinary progress in recent years.	近几年来，巴基斯坦女性教育所取得的最大进步在高等教育。
Their share of total college enrollment has increased from 36% to 57% over the last couple of decades, rising from less than 15,000 in 1993 to 436,000 in 2010.	在过去十几年中，女生在大学生中的比例从36%增至57 % ， 从1993年的不到15000人增加到2010年的436000人。
The proportion of women receiving higher education is approaching the 60% mark, owing to an impressive 28% annual rate of growth in their enrollment numbers in 2010, up from a 20% increase in 1993.	接受高等教育的女性比例正在接近60%大关，2010年女大学生入学率增加28 % ， 1993年增长率为20 % 。
Although a very large number of girls drop out after primary school, the number completing higher education is now large.	尽管大量女生在小学毕业后就会辍学，但完成高等教育的女生数量如今已经颇为庞大。
This year, roughly 750,000 women will graduate from Pakistan’s institutions of higher learning.	今年大约会有75万女大学生从巴基斯坦高等教育机构毕业。
If the current rate of growth is maintained, by 2015 the number of women completing higher education could exceed 1.5 million a year.	如果当前增长率可以维持下去，那么到2015年，完成高等教育的女生数量将超过每年150万。
Had Malala died, she eventually would have been forgotten – another victim of the war that the extremists are waging in Pakistan. Her death would have added just one more individual to the tens of thousands who have already been killed in terrorist attacks across the country.	如果马拉拉被杀，那么她将最终被遗忘，无非是极端组织在巴基斯坦所挑起的战争的又一个受害者，无非是巴基斯坦恐怖主义者所犯下的又一庄血案。
Malala’s survival – and possibly even full recovery – provides a vibrant symbol for a troubled country.	但马拉拉活了下来，甚至可能完全康复，这让她成了困境重重的巴基斯坦令人振奋的象征。
She will begin to be identified with the change that is already underway.	她将与已经点燃星星之火的变革历程一起被人铭记。
It is not often recognized that women in Pakistan – at least those of a certain class – are receiving the kind of education that enables them to enter the modern sectors of the economy or to become entrepreneurs.	在巴基斯坦，女性（至少某个阶级的女性）很难获得能够让她们进入现代经济部门或成为企业家所需要的教育。
In education, numbers make a revolution.	在教育��域，数量就是革命。
The extremists understand that all too well.	极端主义者对此一清二楚。
	
A Talking Cure for Syria	叙利亚的谈判解决方案
LONDON – The proposal by the United States and Russia to hold a diplomatic conference to end the carnage in Syria deserves a less skeptical reaction than it has received.	伦敦—美国和俄罗斯提出的举行外交会议结束叙利亚大屠杀的方案受到了颇多质疑。 其实不应如此。
While it will be difficult to get all of the relevant parties to the table in Geneva any time soon, much less to ensure an outcome that will stick, diplomacy is the only game left.	尽管很难在很短的时间里让各方都来到日内瓦的谈判桌前，保证会议出结果的可能性也很低，但外交已经是唯一的解决之道。
As much as one might wish otherwise, every other policy option canvassed so far is wrong in principle, nonviable in practice, unlikely to be effective, or bound to increase rather than diminish suffering.	你可能还寄希望于其他方案，但目前的其他政策建议要么在原则上有问题，要么在实际中不可行，要么不可能有效果，要么必然会增加而不是减少痛苦。
After two years of civil war, with no decisive military victory by either side in sight, the situation could not be more desperate.	内战爆发已经两年，但没有任何一方能在看得见的未来取得决定性胜利，没有比这更令人绝望的局面了。
According to current United Nations estimates, more than 80,000 Syrians are dead, and 6.8 million – one-third of the country’s population – need urgent humanitarian assistance.	据联合国的估计，超过80 000叙利亚人丧生，680万人 — — 相当于该国人口的三分之一 — — 需要紧急人道主义援助。
Some 4.25 million are displaced internally, and more than 1.5 million have fled the country, sheltering as refugees mainly in Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey.	约425万人在国内流离失所，超过150万人流往国外，逃亡目的地主要是黎巴嫩、约旦和土耳其。
The strain on Syria’s neighbors is immense, and the conflict is inexorably seeping into the wider region.	叙利亚邻国受到了巨大的压力，而冲突正在无情地在更广的地区蔓延。
Both government and rebel forces have committed atrocity crimes.	政府军和叛军都犯下了残暴罪行。
Many more are feared as violence among the main sectarian groups escalates.	随着主要宗派团体之间暴力的升级，许多人惊恐不已。
Continued international paralysis is indefensible.	国际社会对此持续无动于衷是不行的。
Inaction would ignite fires throughout the Middle East, and would violate the international community’s now-accepted responsibility to protect, through timely and decisive collective action, populations at risk of genocide, ethnic cleansing, and other major crimes against humanity and war crimes.	不作为会导致燎原之火席卷中东，也将违反如今被国际社会所接受的保护责任 — — 通过及时果断的集体行动保护人民免受种族灭绝、种族清洗和其他反人类罪和战争罪伤害。
That principle, unanimously agreed by the UN General Assembly in 2005, has been successfully invoked elsewhere, including in support of diplomatic intervention in Kenya in 2008.	这一在2005年联合国大会一致通过的原则在其他地区都能良好地贯彻，包括支持2008年对肯尼亚的外交干预。
It also underpinned Security Council-mandated military interventions in Libya and Cote d’Ivoire in 2011 and, more recently, in Mali.	它支持了联合国安理会授权的对利比亚和科特迪瓦（2011年）一级马里（最近）的军事干预。
But how can it be applied to the mess now in Syria?	但如何把它应用于当前的叙利亚乱象？
The most immediate need, about which there should be little controversy, is massive humanitarian assistance.	应该没有争议的最紧迫的需要是大规模人道主义援助。
Delivery problems abound in the war zones, but not everywhere.	运送问题在战区存在，但并非处处存在。
Yet international donors are dragging their feet both in meeting existing commitments and in making new ones.	但国际援助者既没有兑现已经许下的承诺，也不再做出新的承诺。
And all the aid in the world won’t stop the killing.	而援助是不足以结束杀戮的。
It is too late now for non-military tools of coercion to have much effect, although Security Council threats of International Criminal Court prosecution for atrocity crimes – including any use of chemical weapons – must remain on the table .	如今，采取非军事强制手段已经无法再取得很好的效果，尽管安理会威胁要将暴行 — — 包括任何使用化学武器的行为 — — 送上国际刑事法庭不能取消。
But what of the military-response options still strongly favored by many policymakers and pundits?	但许多决策者和专家仍大力支持的军事干预选择又如何？
The trouble is that every tray in this toolkit, too, is empty.	麻烦在于这个工具箱里德所有工具包也都是空空如也。
Direct military intervention to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime would never win Security Council approval, and has no volunteers anyway among capable military powers – albeit in most cases because of the political and military risks involved, rather than the legal indefensibility of acting outside the UN Charter.	直接军事干预推翻叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德政权不可能赢得安理会批准，有能力进行军事干预的大国也不会站出来充当志愿军 — — 尽管原因大多是政治性和军事风险性的，而不是因为在联合国宪章之外采取行动的非法性。
A less partisan intervention – pouring in troops and airpower to separate the warring parties forcibly – also has no takers, no likely UN authority, and only marginal hope of causing less harm than it would be intended to avoid.	偏向性更小的干预 — — 派遣军队和控制制空权从而强制分离战争双方 — — 也没有实施者，无法获得联合国授权，其效果也只能是减少伤害，而不可能是计划中的避免伤害。
There are many more enthusiasts for a more calibrated military intervention, designed to establish one or more no-fly zones, and maybe safe havens and humanitarian corridors on the ground.	精确军事干预的热情要大得多 — — 如建立一个或多个禁飞区以及地面安全港和人道主义通道。
In the early days of the crisis, it was argued that, given the strength of the regime’s air defenses and ground forces, even these limited objectives could not be achieved without fighting an all-out war – and thus causing a net increase in human suffering.	在冲突之初，有人指出，拜巴沙尔政权的空中和地面优势所赐，即使是这样的优先目标也无法在不进行全面战争的情况下实现，因而这会大大增加人道伤害。
With most of the country now ablaze, this argument is less convincing.	目前，战火已经蔓延了叙利亚的大部分国土，这一观点的说服力更低了。
But it remains the case that there are no obvious takers for a military role, partly because of the scale, difficulty, and risk of the commitment required, and partly because of the likely political and legal costs, given the minimal prospect of Security Council endorsement.	但有一点仍然正确：没有显而易见的军事角色承担者，这部分是因为这一角色的规模、困难和风险所致，部分是因为潜在成本和法律成本，因为安理会很难支持这样的行动。
The United Kingdom and France are pressing hard for indirect military intervention: supplying arms to the rebel side, in their view, would be a low-cost, low-risk, potentially high-return option.	英国和法国在大力宣传间接军事干预：向叛军供应武器。 在它们看来，这是低成本、低风险、高潜在回报的选择。
And the European Union has now lifted its ban.	欧盟已经取消了禁令。
But the US is rightly cautious.	但美国正确地对此颇为谨慎。
A troubling proportion of the opposition forces are Islamic extremists, and there is no guarantee that weapons deliveries will stay out of their hands.	叛军中不乏伊斯兰极端主义反对武装，没人能保证武器不会输送到他们手中。
More broadly, increases in the supply of weapons funneled to rebel forces by Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and others have correlated with surges in the civilian death toll, suggesting that they cost more lives than they save – and with no evident strategic gains.	更广地说，通过卡塔尔、沙特和其他渠道流向叛军的武器供应的增加与平民死亡人数暴增有关，这表明武器供应夺命比救命更厉害，而且没有带来任何明显的战略利益。
The Assad regime, with its own external supporters, seems likely to have no difficulty matching any new hardware thrown at it.	巴沙尔政权及其本身的外部支持者似乎可以毫无困难地赶超对手获得的硬件设施。
If the rationale for arming the opposition is not so much to win the war as to weaken the government’s resistance to negotiation, it is arguable that the elements of a “hurting stalemate” are already in place, with more weapons likely to produce nothing but more fighting and more casualties.	如果武装反对派的理由与其说是为了赢得战争，不如说是减少政府对谈判的抵制，那么可以说 ， “ 有害僵局”的要素已经具备，更多的武器除了制造更多的战争和更多的伤亡之外别无用处。
The pressure that has always mattered most for the Assad regime is that capable of being applied by Russia.	对巴沙尔政权最有效的压力是俄罗斯可以做什么。
What is new, and encouraging, about the events of the last month is that Russia has found enough common ground with the US – in their mutual anxiety about the rising influence of radical Islam in an increasingly fragmented and volatile region – to be prepared at last to do some squeezing.	上个月事件的新的令人鼓舞之处是俄罗斯与美国找到了足够多的共同点 — — 对极端伊斯兰教在日渐脆弱和动荡地区影响力日渐上升的共同担忧 — — 终于可以携手压制了。
Painful concessions will be required from both sides if the Geneva conference is even to convene, let alone reach agreement on a cease-fire and transitional administration.	如果日内瓦会议想要成功召开 — — 更不用说达成停火和过渡性政府协议了 — — 双方都必须做出痛苦的让步。
It is encouraging that the US, following talks between Secretary of State John Kerry and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, seems prepared to accept a role for senior Assad regime members in any settlement, and that constructive proposals are starting to emerge from at least some opposition quarters.	令人鼓舞的是，在国务卿科里和俄罗斯外交部长拉夫罗夫举行会谈后，美国似乎准备好接受巴沙尔政府成员在解决方案中扮演重要角色；此外，至少一些反对派开始提出建设性的方案。
Compromise can be anathema for purists, but it has always been the stuff of which peace is made.	妥协是纯粹主义者最讨厌的东西，但它往往是催生和平的关键。
It has never been more necessary than it is now in Syria.	叙利亚正是如此。
	
The Limits of Twitter Diplomacy	Twitter外交的限度
DENVER – Twentieth-century American statecraft produced Dean Acheson, Henry Kissinger, Richard Holbrooke, and many others who balanced the power of the United States with its responsibilities to develop key relationships, solve problems, and build international structures.	丹佛 — — 二十世纪美国的治国方略催生出艾奇逊、基辛格和霍尔布鲁克和其他众多政治家，成功平衡了美国发展重要关系、解决问题、建设国际体系的义务和美国的国力。
“Twenty-first-century statecraft,” we have been told repeatedly, promises to go further and deliver more, for now US diplomats – and those of other countries – can use Twitter, Facebook, and other social media.	我们反复听人提及“二十一世纪治国方略” 有望更进一步、取得更多成果，因为现在美国和其他国家的外交官可以利用Twitter，Facebook和其他社交媒体。
With so many international problems today, diplomacy does need to combine the old-fashioned statecraft of the twentieth century with the new tools that budding technologies have provided.	面对今天这么多国际问题，外交官们确实要综合利用二十世纪经典治国方略和新兴技术提供的工具。
But tools alone cannot solve or build anything.	但单靠工具解决不了任何问题。
And yet the new tools are everywhere.	但新的工具触手可及。
It is hard to find a US ambassador in any part of the world who has not embraced the challenge of mastering these communication technologies.	世界各地的美国大使均已欣然接受了掌握这些通信技术所带来的难题。
Most have a Twitter or Facebook account, or post frequently on YouTube, in order to keep the public in the countries where they serve (and at home) informed of their daily activities, or occasionally their thinking about an issue or even their mood.	他们多数已经开通了Twitter或Facebook账户，或者频繁地在YouTube上发帖，目的是让所在国（以及美国本土）民众了解他们的日常活动，偶尔表达对某个问题的看法，甚至表露他们的心情。
The State Department estimates that its employees are in direct communication with more than 15 million people worldwide.	国务院估计其工作人员在世界各地与超过1500万人直接沟通。
Incredibly enough, more than 330,000 people “like” the personality-challenged department’s Facebook page.	令人难以置信的是，超过330,000人“喜欢”正面临个性化挑战的国务院的Facebook网页。
This generation of American diplomats is fast overcoming a reputation for being remote, emotionally distant figures.	这一代美国外交官正在迅速扭转过去疏远和冷漠的名声。
To be fair, in the past, an ambassador had few opportunities to connect with the host country’s population, apart from the occasional newspaper or television interview, or a photo of a meeting with a host country official or waiting on an airport’s tarmac for a visitor from Washington, DC.	公平地讲，除偶尔接受报纸或电视采访、与所在国官员合影或在机场停机坪迎接来自华盛顿的访问者外，过去的大使很少有机会与所在国民众直接沟通。
Now, as America’s tweeting diplomats have shown, there is no shortage of such opportunities.	但现在，美国发表推文的外交官表明根本不缺乏机会沟通。
Time constraints are not an issue.	时间限制不是问题。
Most US embassies ensure a constant stream of tweets by relying on public-diplomacy officers to get the word out about what the ambassador is doing day by day, even hour by hour.	多数美国使馆通过公共外交官发布大使每天、甚至每小时的活动来确保频繁地发布推文。
Many ambassadors have built mass followings in electronic terms, and generate numerous “likes” as they go about their daily routines of meetings and ribbon cuttings.	很多大使都积累了大量的电子追随者，并在完成会见剪彩等日常活动之余让不少人“喜欢”他们的推文。
All fun stuff.	这的确很有意思。
But have social media really made for better diplomats or helped solve difficult problems?	但社交媒体是否真的提升了外交质量或有助于解决疑难问题？
If so, why are there so many unmitigated and unmediated crises around the world – Syria’s civil war, the carnage in Egypt, and deteriorating US-Russian relations, to name just a few.	如若果真如此，那叙利亚内战、埃及大屠杀及美俄关系恶化等全世界那么多未经调停的严重危机又怎么解释？
The much-ballyhooed twenty-first-century statecraft, it seems, is really not up to the job.	很多人大肆宣扬的二十一世纪治国方略似乎并没有那么神奇。
Advocates accurately point out that social media are a tool that is ignored at one’s peril.	支持者们说得非常准确，谁敢忽视社交媒体风险自担。
But what is urgently needed today is an understanding that diplomacy is not only about shouting from the rooftops and communicating with the general public.	但今天人们迫切需要理解外交并不是高高在上地与公众交流。
It is about working on relationships one at a time.	外交的实质是建立关系。
Above all, it is about keeping the door open to deal with unsavory governments.	归根结底，外交是要与令人厌恶的政府保持沟通。
Governments, even terrible ones, comprise the people who lead a country.	哪怕再糟糕的政府也是由国家领导人组成。
Maybe they shouldn’t be in power; maybe the people demonstrating in the streets should be.	也许他们根本不应该掌权；也许掌权的应该是街头的示威群众。
But, in the here and now, these relationships need to be maintained in order to help polarized societies make progress toward overcoming their divisions.	但此时此地，仍然需要与之保持关系，帮助两极分化的社会在克服分歧方面取得进展。
The US ambassador to Egypt, Anne W. Patterson, was excoriated in the media – especially in social media, which have no international boundaries (and often no manners) – for her courageous efforts to keep the door open for dialogue with the Muslim Brotherhood government.	美国驻埃及大使安妮·帕特森遭到媒体、尤其是社交媒体（往往既没有国界也没有礼貌）的严厉批评，他们对她与穆兄会政府保持接触的勇敢努力进行抨击。
She did what any good – and, in her case, superb – diplomat should do: maintain relations with both sides and try to find a way forward.	她完成了任何称职 — — 就她而言甚至是卓越的 — — 外交官应当完成的任务：与双方保持关系，力求找到现实的解决方案。
Indeed, the Muslim Brotherhood government and the secular opposition both complained about America’s relationship with the other.	事实上，穆兄会政府和世俗反对派都对美国与对方的关系颇多怨言。
That is the hot seat where American diplomacy belongs.	这就是美国外交官的尴尬境遇。
With all due respect to “eDiplomacy,” this type of private, traditional communication remains the heart and soul of the business.	尽管承认“电子外交”的作用，这种传统的私下交流仍然是现代外交的核心和灵魂。
Similarly, Secretary of State John Kerry has launched a courageous effort to revive the Israel-Palestine peace process.	同样，国务卿约翰·克里大胆努力恢复以巴和平进程。
Given the dearth of public information about his strategy, it is clear that he is not an avid practitioner of twenty-first-century statecraft – that is, he does not think out loud.	鉴于有关其战略的公众信息匮乏，很显然他不是二十一世纪治国方略的狂热倡导者 — — 换句话说，他极少高调宣传。
And yet he got the parties together by developing trust, which is the coin of the realm for an effective diplomat.	但他通过建立互信让各方走到一起，这是他身为高效外交官的最好象征。
It is perhaps a little unfair to contrast these efforts to what the US did in Syria.	用上述努力与美国在叙利亚的所作所为相比或许有些不公平。
In an effort to stay ahead of intense media expectations (and reflecting a misunderstanding according to which Syria would be just another Tunisia), President Barack Obama’s administration essentially severed America’s relationship with Bashar al-Assad’s regime by publicly embracing the disparate opposition and calling for Assad’s immediate removal.	仅仅为满足媒体的强烈期待（并且反思叙利亚将步突尼斯后尘的误解 ） ， 奥巴马总统政府基本上切断了美国与阿萨德政权的关系，公开承认一盘散沙的反对派，并呼吁阿萨德立即下台。
The US did not offer any clear indication of what it thought should follow such an outcome, apart from some kind of election process, which in a largely sectarian conflict like Syria’s would amount to nothing more than an elaborate census.	除某种形式的选举外，美国并没有明确说出今后的行动步骤，而选举进程在像叙利亚这样宗派冲突中不过是一次煞费苦心的人口普查。
Lo and behold, political leaders, especially tough and terrible ones like Assad, tend not to embrace a process whose stated purpose is to eliminate them.	特别是像阿萨德这样强硬可怕的政治领袖，往往不会接受从一开始就以推翻他们为目的的政治进程。
US diplomats – indeed, all countries’ diplomats – might want to consider that, rather than chasing record numbers of social media “followers,” they should be building trust on all sides in conflict-prone societies and looking for more leaders willing to take chances for peace.	美国外交官 — — 事实上是所有国家的外交官或许应当思考这个问题，而不是以社交媒体“追随者”创纪录为目标。 他们应当在冲突各方间建立信任，寻找更多愿意为和平而冒险的领袖。
When the shooting has stopped and the sides are talking, diplomats can tweet to their hearts’ content.	当枪声停止且各方开始谈判，外交官或许可以随心所欲地发表推文。
	
Why Do Economies Stop Growing?	经济为何不再增长？
MILAN – Over the years, advanced and developing countries have experimented, sometimes deliberately and frequently inadvertently, with a variety of approaches to growth.	米兰—多年来，发达和发展中国家试验了一系列增长办法 — — 有时是有意为之，大部分是无心插柳。
Unfortunately, many of these strategies have turned out to have built-in limitations or decelerators – what one might call elements of unsustainability.	不幸的是，这些战略多具有内生性极限或减速效应 — — 也可以称之为不可持续性。
And avoiding serious damage and difficult recoveries requires us to get a lot better at recognizing these self-limiting growth patterns early on.	要想避免严重伤害和复苏不力，就必须及早认清这些自我局限的增长模式。
Here are some of the items in a growing library of decelerating growth models.	我们来讨论一些有减速效应的增长模型，这方面的例子正在日渐增多。
In developing countries, import substitution as a way to jump-start economic diversification can work for a while; but, over time, as productivity growth lags and comparative advantage is over-ridden, growth grinds to a halt.	在发展中国家，以进口替代作为经济多样化的启动手段可以在短期内见效，但假以时日，随着生产率增长的落后和比较优势弱化，增长会陷入停滞。
Small, open economies are naturally somewhat specialized, which leaves them vulnerable to shocks and volatility.	小型开放经济天生具有专门性，这意味着它们极易受冲击和波动的干扰。
But, in terms of growth and living standards, the cost of economic diversification, when implemented by protecting domestic industries from foreign competition, eventually outweighs the benefits.	但是，从增长和生活水平角度讲，经济多元化的成本（如果多元化是以保护本国工业免受外国竞争的办法实现的）最终将会压倒收益。
It is better to allow specialization, and build effective social safety nets and support systems to protect people and families during economic transitions.	更好的做法是走专门化道路，同时建设高效的社会安全网和支持系统从而在经济转型期保护人民和家庭。
Such “structural flexibility” is better adapted to enabling the broad changes that rapidly evolving technological and global economic forces require.	这一“结构性灵活度”能更好地适应剧变，这也是日新月异的技术和全球经济力量演化所要求的。
Mismanagement of natural-resource wealth underpins an especially potent self-limiting pattern of growth and development.	自然资源财富的管理不善便是典型的自我局限型增长和发展模式。
If invested in infrastructure, education, and external financial assets, natural-resource revenues can accelerate growth. But, too often, such revenues distort economic incentives, which come to favor rent-seeking and interfere with the diversification that is essential for growth.	如果将自然资源收入投资于基础设施、教育和外部金融资产等方面，则能加速增长，但是，跟多情况下，自然资源收入会扭曲经济激励，朝着有利于寻租的方向发展，而不利于增长所要求的多元化。
More recently, many advanced countries have discovered a “new” set of growth models with built-in structural limitations: excessive private or public consumption, or both, usually accompanied and enabled by rising debt and inflated asset prices, and a corresponding decline in investment.	更晚近一些，许多发达国家发现了一种具有内生结构性局限的“新”发展模型：私人或公共消费过度，或兼而有之，并通常伴随或由债务增长和资产价格膨胀以及相应的投资下降所致。
This approach appears to work until domestic aggregate demand can no longer sustain growth and employment, at which point it ends in either gradual stagnation or a violent financial and economic crisis.	这一模式会一直有效，直到国内总需求不再能够维持增长和就业，要么逐渐陷入停滞，要么发生严重金融和经济危机。
(In fact, many developing countries have learned this the hard way, but the lessons seem not to have crossed over to advanced countries.)	（事实上，许多发展中国家对此都有深刻教训，但发达国家并没有什么体验。 ）
But the opposite of the excessive-consumption model – excessive reliance on investment to generate aggregate demand – is also a self-limiting growth pattern.	但消费过度模型的反面 — — 过度依赖投资形成总需求 — — 同样是一种自我局限型增长模式。
When the private and social returns of investment diminish too much, growth cannot be sustained indefinitely, even though rising investment rates can sustain aggregate demand for a while.	随着投资的私人和社会回报一降再降，增长将不可能永久维持下去，尽管不断增加的投资率能够在短期维持总需求。
Altering this growth pattern is a significant part of the challenge that China now faces.	摆脱这一增长模式是中国当前所面临的重大挑战之一。
Rising inequality in either opportunity or outcomes (and often both) also poses threats to the sustainability of growth patterns.	机会和结果方面的不平等性的愈演愈烈（通常这两方面同时发生）也会对增长模式的可持续性构成威胁。
While people in a wide range of countries accept some degree of market-determined income variation, based on differential talents and personal preferences, there are limits.	在一个多层次国家中，人民能够接受一定程度的由市场决定的收入差异，但这种差异必须建立在天分和个人偏好不同的基础上，而且必须有个限度。
When they are breached, the typical result is a sense of unfairness, followed by resistance and, ultimately, political choices that address the inequality, though sometimes in counter-productive, growth-impeding ways.	如果不平等性越了界，最典型的结果就是产生不公平感，从而引发反抗情绪，最终将会形成修正不平等问题的政治选择，有时这种选择是反生产、不利于增长的。
Perhaps the largest long-run sustainability issue concerns the adequacy of the global economy’s natural-resource base: output will more than triple over the coming two or three decades, as high-growth developing economies’ four billion people converge toward advanced-country income levels and consumption patterns.	也许最大的长期可持续性隐忧在于全球经济自然资源基础是否充分：随着高增长发展中国家的40亿人口的收入水平和消费模式向发达国家看齐，产出将在未来二三十年内增长两倍以上。
Existing economic-development strategies will require significant adaption to accommodate this kind of growth.	现有经济发展战略要求实施重大调整以适应这种类型的增长。
Some adaptation will occur naturally, as rising energy and other commodity prices generate incentives to economize or seek alternatives.	一些调整会自动发生，因为上涨的能源及其他商品价格将产生节约和寻找替代品的激励。
But the un-priced environmental externalities – global warming and water depletion, for example – will require serious attention, not myopic, reactive mindsets and approaches.	但无价可循的环境外部性 — — 比如全球变暖和缺水 — — 必须引起严重关注，采取具有远见卓识的应对措施。
All of these self-limiting growth patterns tend to have three things in common.	所有这些自我局限型增长模式具有三个共同点。
First, in one or several dimensions, some part of the economy’s base of tangible, intangible, and natural-resource assets is being run down.	首先，在一个或几个方面，经济的有形、无形和自然资源资产基础正在耗尽。
I would include social cohesion as part of the asset base: it is the one that is depreciated by excessive inequality.	我把社会凝聚力也纳入资产基础的概念中，它是一种因过度不平等而折旧的资产。
Measurement issues play an important role here.	在这方面，度量问题很重要。
It is easier to run down something that is partly invisible because it is not regularly or effectively measured.	具有一定程度不可见性的东西更容易耗尽，因为没有定期、有效的度量方法。
Expanded measurement of the dimensions of economic, social, and environmental performance is necessary to broaden awareness of sustainability issues.	扩大对经济、社会和环境表现诸方面的度量手段是增进对可持续性问题理解的必要条件。
Second, unidentified self-limiting growth patterns produce very bad results.	其次，未被识别的自我局限型增长模式会造成极坏的结果。
Expectations come to exceed reality, and resetting the system to a sustainable growth pattern is difficult.	预期总会超越现实，将增长模式予以重置以恢复可持续性是很困难的。
After all, past investment shortfalls have to be made up and future-oriented investments undertaken simultaneously – a double burden that must be borne by the current generation.	毕竟，过去造成的投资短缺必须得到弥补，与此同时，还要进行面向未来的投资，因此当下的一代就不得不背负起双重负担。
An inability to resolve the distributional and fairness problem can produce gridlock, paralysis, and prolonged stagnation.	无法解决分配和公平问题将导致长期停滞僵局，造成经济瘫痪。
Finally, many of these flawed growth patterns involve fiscal distress.	最后，这些有缺陷的增长模式往往造成财政困局。
Contrary to the prevailing wisdom nowadays, some degree of Keynesian demand management in the transition to a more sustainable growth pattern is not in conflict with restoring fiscal balance over a sensible time period.	与当下流行的智慧相反，在向更具可持续性的增长模式转型过程中实行一定程度的凯恩斯主义需求管理与在一个合理时期内重建财政平衡并不矛盾。
On the contrary, applied both individually and together, fiscal stimulus and consolidation are necessary parts of the adjustment process.	相反，财政刺激和整合（不管是单独使用还是综合使用）乃是调整过程的必需组成部分。
But they are not sufficient.	但这还不够。
The crucial missing pieces are a shift in the structure of accessible aggregate demand and restoration of those parts of the economy’s asset base that have been run down, implying the need for structural change and investment.	我们忽略了几个关键点 — — 可实现总需求结构的变化和经济资产基础中已耗尽部分的恢复，它们意味着需要实施结构性变革和投资。
	
Why Does Angela Merkel Hesitate?	默克尔为何迟疑不决？
MUNICH – “Where is Angela?” is the question The Economist asked when Nicolas Sarkozy, Gordon Brown, and José Manuel Barroso met to prepare a European economic stimulus plan without Chancellor Merkel being present.	慕尼黑 - - 当萨尔科奇、布朗和巴罗索在没有德国总理默克尔在场的情况下会面准备欧洲经济刺激计划的时候，英国经济学人杂志提出了“默克尔在哪里”的问题。
Indeed, Germany is currently the spoiler in the competition to provide billions to prevent a breakdown of the world economy.	确实，目前各国竞相提供数十亿计的资金来防止世界经济崩盘，德国就成了阻碍。
Why is Germany so hesitant when it comes to economic stimulus programs?	在经济刺激上，德国为何如此迟疑呢？
One popular theory is that, given the supply-side orientation of German economists, there is little sympathy for Keynesian, demand-oriented prescriptions.	其中一个普通的解释是，德国经济学家信奉供应派学说，对凯恩斯学派需求导向的药方并不热衷。
But no German economist has come out against an economic stimulus program, and many favor one.	但是德国经济学家中没有一个站出来反对经济刺激计划，而且很多人还赞同经济刺激。
Whereas Keynesian theory has largely disappeared from economic textbooks in the United States, it continues to be taught everywhere in Germany.	凯恩斯理论已经基本上从美国的经济学教科书中消失，但是德国各地还在继续教授这一理论。
German economists, in contrast to their American colleagues, never abandoned Keynesian policies as a means to combat demand deficits.	与美国同行相比，德国经济学家们从来没有放弃过凯恩斯主义政策来作为解决需求赤字问题的一种途经。
Moreover, German politicians rarely heed the advice of German economists.	而且，德国政坛人物很少听取德国经济学家们的意见。
A second hypothesis is closer to the truth: the decline of economic activity in Germany thus far has not been as strong as in other countries.	第二个假设更为接近事实，那也就是德国经济下滑目前为止还并不像其他国家那样强烈。
Germany did not have a real-estate bubble that threatened to burst, as did Great Britain, Ireland, Spain, and France.	德国并非像英国、爱尔兰、西班牙以及法国那样形成房地产泡沫并且即将破裂。
Germany has only been indirectly affected – by the decline in worldwide demand for German products – which explains an important timing difference in the business cycle.	德国只是由于全球对德国产品需求下降而间接受到影响。 这也就是为何商业周期中存在重要的时间差。
Whereas unemployment in the US has been rising for one and a half years, Germany currently is enjoying its lowest unemployment rate in 16 years.	美国的失业率在过去一年半时间里一直在上升，而德国目前的失业率却是16年以来最低的。
The German construction industry and retailing are still stable, as the latest survey of the Ifo Institute shows, and the whole world is profiting from this stability, as Germany is the second largest importer of goods and services after the US.	Ifo研究所最新的调查显示，德国的建筑和零售行业依旧稳定。 全世界也从这一稳定局面中收益，因为德国是仅次于美国之后的世界第二大商品和服务进口国。
While US imports are declining sharply, German imports are holding up –without any economic stimulus plan.	美国进口大幅度下降，而德国进口却在没有经济刺激计划的情况下维持原状。
This is why many Germans wonder whether the foreign criticism is fair.	这就是为何德国人疑惑外国人的批评是否公平。
To be sure, the world recession will hit Germany with full force.	的确，世界经济衰退将会全面打击德国。
The Ifo Institute has forecast that GDP will contract by 2.2% in 2009.	Ifo研究所预计，德国GDP将会在2009年萎缩2.2 % 。
But the contraction will be primarily because of declining exports, a large portion of which consists of investment goods, as well as the drop in domestic equipment investment.	但是这一萎缩主要将会由于出口和国内设备投资下降而造成，而德国出口的一大部分包括投资设备。
These are areas where there is not much that the state can do to help.	还有一些领域国家是无能为力的。
It can cut taxes to stimulate consumption and it can invest in construction, but these sectors currently need little help, except perhaps for the automobile industry.	政府可以降低税收来刺激消费，还可以投资建筑行业。 但是目前这些行业可能除了汽车制造业之外基本上不需要帮助。
This could, of course, quickly change.	当然这一局面可能马上改变。
When the second-round effects hit the domestic sector in the course of 2009, a stimulus program will be needed.	当2009年第二轮影响波及到国内部门的时候就需要经济刺激了。
From the German perspective, the best timing for such a program would be the autumn of next year.	从德国的观点来看，经济刺激最好的时机就是明年秋天。
If the money is spent now, the economy in some sectors could overheat, helping no one.	如果现在就花钱，那么某些经济部门就会过热，对谁都没有帮助。
Paul Krugman, who has aimed massive criticism at Germany’s government, should keep this in mind.	克鲁格曼对德国政府大加指责，他应当知道这一点。
Krugman is an excellent economist.	克鲁格曼是一名出色的经济学家。
He is right in principle in demanding a major economic stimulus package from the German government that goes beyond the €35 billion already planned.	德国政府已经计划好350亿欧元的经济刺激计划，而他则要求进一步，这在原则上是对的。
But he should not ignore the time lags between the American and the German economic cycles.	但是，他不应该忽略美德两国经济周期的时间差。
Germany should prepare its economic stimulus program now and implement it when the time comes.	德国应该现在着手准备经济刺激计划并且在适当的时候予以落实。
A third hypothesis to explain Germany’s hesitancy is suspicion of the European Union’s redistribution machinery.	有关德国行动迟缓的第三个假设是怀疑欧盟的重新分配机制。
When Sarkozy and other EU leaders demand Germany’s participation in an economic stimulus and rescue package, one reason is that they expect Germany to again bear the lion’s share of the costs.	当萨尔科奇和其他欧盟领导人要求德国参与经济刺激和援救项目的时候，其中一个原因是他们想要让德国再一次承担大部分费用。
For example, of the €5 billion extension of the Cohesion Funds approved by the European Parliament in December 2007, Germany received nothing, but it bears 20% of the costs.	例如，欧洲议会在2007年12月批准延长价值五十亿的团结基金，德国分文未得，但是确支付了20%的费用。
Germans have always been enthusiastic proponents of the EU, not least because they hoped that a European identity would help compensate for their damaged national identity.	德国人一直热切支持欧盟，这并不仅仅是因为他们希望欧洲身份可以帮助补偿受损的民族身份。
So, whenever it came to restructuring the EU, they always accepted a level of influence that was small relative to their country’s size.	因此，只要涉及欧盟重建，他们总是愿意接受相对小于其国家规模的影响力。
Although Germany’s share of the EU population is 17%, it receives 13% of the voting rights in the EU Parliament.	尽管德国人口占欧盟的17 % ， 但是它在欧盟议会中只有13%的投票权。
Its share in the more important Council of Ministers is only 8%, the same as that of the French, whose population share is 13%.	在更为重要的部长理事会中德国只有8%的投票权。 法国人口只占13 % ， 但是有一样的投票权。
Former French President Jacques Chirac did not hesitate to justify this imbalance with a reference to World War II, which the Germans accepted.	法国前总统希拉克总是用第二次世界大战来给这一不平衡提供理由，德国也接受这一说法。
But their enthusiasm has limits.	但是德国的热情也有限度。
After all, aside from political under-representation, Germany’s annual contribution to the EU budget (most recently €7.4 billion) makes the country by far the largest net contributor.	毕竟，除了在政治上没有得到充分代表外，德国每年向欧盟预算提供资金(最近是74亿欧元 ) ， 遥遥领先成为最大的净贡献国。
Germany finances 20% of the EU budget but receives only 12% of EU spending.	德国提供欧盟资金的20 % ， 而只得到12%的欧盟开支。
Willingness could be exhausted if the EU budget is further expanded without reducing Germany’s net contribution and narrowing the gap between its financing and voting rights.	如果欧盟预算进一步扩大而并不减少德国的净贡献以及缩小资金和投票权之间的差异的话，那么，德国的意愿就会到头了。
For these reasons, German reservations also extend to the European economic government that Sarkozy advocates, and that, again, would be financed more than proportionately with German money.	出于这些原因，德国对萨尔科奇主张的欧洲经济政府的主张也持有保留意见，而这一欧洲经济政府也将会主要是由德国不成比例地资助。
Sarkozy regards an EU economic government as a way to preserve his leadership in the EU beyond France’s Council presidency, which is now ending.	萨尔科奇把欧盟经济政府视为在法国的欧盟轮值主席结束之后保留其欧盟领导地位的手段。
Although the Czech Republic will assume the EU presidency in January, this has not prevented the French President from convening a new EU summit under Sarkozy’s leadership in the first half of 2009.	尽管捷克将会在一月担任欧盟轮值主席，但是这并没有阻止法国总统在2009年上半年主持召开一次新的欧盟首脑会议。
This affront will put not only Czech tolerance to the test, but also that of Merkel.	这一冒犯不仅会考验捷克的容忍程度，而且也会考验默克尔。
In the end, she will probably give in to Sarkozy’s wishes in order to avoid endangering her chances of re-election in September because of a conflict with the French.	最终，她会有可能屈从于萨尔科奇的意愿以避免由于同法国冲突而危及其九月再次当选。
But she will surely do so with clenched fists.	但是她这样做肯定是心怀不满。
	
Why Do Smart People Live Longer?	智者何以长寿
EDINBURGH – People with higher intelligence test scores in childhood and early adulthood tend to live longer.	爱丁堡 - - 儿童时期以及早期成年智力测验成绩较高的人一般更加长寿。
This result has been found among people from Australia, Denmark, England and Wales, Scotland, Sweden, and the United States.	澳大利亚、丹麦、英格兰、威尔士、苏格兰、瑞典以及美国等国家的人群中验证了这一结果。
In fact, it has been found within every population that has been studied.	实际上，几乎所有接受研究的人群都验证了这一结果。
Indeed, the impact of intelligence on mortality rivals well-known risk factors for illness and death, such as high blood pressure, being overweight, high blood glucose, and high cholesterol.	确实，智力水平对死亡率的影响与众所周知的疾病和死亡风险因素相匹配。
Its effect is almost as important as that of smoking.	这些风险因素包括高血压、体重超重、高血葡萄糖以及高卡路里，其影响几乎与吸烟一样重要。
Differences in human intelligence have environmental and genetic causes.	人类智力水平的差异有环境和基因的原因。
An intelligence test score in early life is partly a record of what the environment has wrought on the brain and the rest of the body up to that time.	早年智力测验成绩在一定程度上记录了截至当时环境对大脑和身体其他部位的影响。
Babies who have lower birth weights, for example, are more prone to chronic illnesses later in life.	例如，出生体重较轻的婴儿在以后更容易得慢性疾病。
They also have, on average, slightly lower intelligence.	平均而言，他们智力水平较低。
But tests of whether birth weight might explain some of the link between intelligence and mortality have found no connection.	但是出生时的体重是否可以解释智力水平和死亡率之间的某些联系并没有找到联系。
Parents’ occupations are also related to their child’s intelligence and later risk of illness: children from more privileged backgrounds tend to have higher intelligence and better health, and to live longer.	父母的职业也与儿童的智力水平以及后期疾病风险有关。 家庭背景更好的孩子一般具有更高的智力水平，身体较好，而且长寿。
However, there is no convincing evidence that parental background explains the link between higher intelligence and longer life.	但是，人们还没有确凿的证据表明父母背景可以解释高智力水平和长寿之间的联系。
Other researchers have viewed intelligence test scores as possibly more than just an indicator of an efficient brain.	其他研究人员认为，智力水平测验说明的东西不仅仅是大脑运转良好的表现。
After all, the brain is just one organ of the body, so people whose brains work well in early life may also have other organs and systems that are more efficient than others’.	毕竟，大脑只是人体的一个器官。 因此，早年大脑运转灵活的人也可能具有比其他人更为有效的其他器官和身体系统。
But this “system integrity” idea is somewhat vague and difficult to test.	但是这一“系统完整”的观点有点模糊而且难以测试。
The best we have done to date has been to examine whether people’s reaction speeds are related to intelligence and to mortality.	我们目前为止做得最好的情况就是检查人的反应速度是否与智力水平和死亡率有关。
They are.	它们确实有关。
Reaction-time tests involve little thinking, and merely ask people to respond as fast as they can to simple stimuli.	反应时间测试几乎不用思考，仅仅是让人们对简单的刺激做出尽可能快的反应。
People who react faster have, on average, higher intelligence scores and live longer.	平均而言，反应快的人智力水平较高而且长寿。
But we need to think of better measures of the body’s integrity to test this idea more fully.	但是我们需要考虑有关身体完整的更好的标准来更加完整地测试这一观点。
A third potential explanation is that intelligence is about good decision-making.	第三个可能的解释是，所谓智力就是良好的决策。
Every day, as we live our lives, we make decisions about our health: what, when, and how much to eat; how much exercise to take; how to look after ourselves if we have an illness; and so forth.	我们每天生活中都要对我们的身体健康做出决定。 这些决定包括我们吃什么、什么时候吃以及吃多少，进行多少锻炼，有了疾病如何照料自己以及等等其他问题。
Therefore, the reason that intelligence and death are linked might be that people with higher intelligence in childhood make better decisions about health, and have healthier behaviors.	因此，智力和死亡相关的原因可能是，儿童时期智力水平更高的人对身体健康问题做出更好的决定，而且行为也更加健康。
As adults, they tend to have better diets, exercise more, gain less weight, have fewer hangovers, and so on.	作为成年人，他们一般饮食搭配较好，锻炼更多，体重增加较少，不大喝醉酒等等。
So far, so good.	目前还都不错。
But we do not yet have the full story.	但是我们还没有掌握全部情况。
There have not been any studies with data on childhood intelligence, lots of subsequent data on adult health behaviors, and then a long-term follow-up for deaths.	有关儿童智力、成年健康行为的大量数据以及对死亡的长期跟踪还没有任何研究。
And only such a study could tell us whether it is these healthy behaviors that explain the link between intelligence and death.	而只有这一研究才能够告诉我们是否是这些健康行为可以解释智力和死亡之间的联系。
A fourth type of explanation is that people with higher intelligence in childhood tend to attain better educational qualifications, work in more professional jobs, have higher incomes, and live in more affluent areas.	第四种解释是，儿童时期智力较高的人通常会获得较好的教育，从事更多的专业工作，具有更高的收入，而且居住在更富有的区域。
These variables are related to living longer, too.	这些可变因素也与长寿相关。
So, perhaps that’s it: higher intelligence buys people into safer and more health-friendly environments.	所以可能是这样，也就是智力水平较高可以让人进入更为安全和对健康更为有利的环境。
Certainly, in some studies, social class in adulthood seems to explain a lot of the link between intelligence and death.	当然，在某些研究中，成年时期的社会阶层似乎可以解释智力水平和死亡之间的关联。
The problem is that this “explanation” is statistical.	问题是，这一“解释”是统计意义上的。
We are still not sure whether, say, education and occupation “explain” the effect of intelligence on health, or whether they are, in effect, merely surrogate measures of intelligence.	我们还是不确定教育和职业是否“解释”智力对健康的影响，或者它们是否实际上仅仅是智力替代衡量标准。
Researchers have also searched for clues about the intelligence-mortality link in specific types of death.	研究人员还在具体死亡种类中寻求智力和死亡之间的联系。
This has been revealing.	这些研究颇有发现。
Lower intelligence in early life is associated with a greater likelihood of dying from, for example, cardiovascular disease, accidents, suicide, and homicide.	早年智力较低就更有可能死于心血管疾病、自杀以及杀人。
The evidence for cancer is less certain.	有关癌症的证据并不明朗。
As we have come across these specific findings, we have realized that each link might need a different explanation.	当我们发现这些具体情况时，我们已经意识到每个联系都可能需要不同的解释。
Finally, we know that how intelligent we are and how long we shall live are caused by both environmental and genetic influences.	最后，我们知道我们的智力水平和寿命长短是由环境和基因影响共同造成的。
There are experimental designs, using twins, that can find out the extent to which intelligence and mortality are linked because they share environmental and genetic influences.	有一些试验性的研究设计，它们使用双胞胎可以发现由于他们具有共同的环境和基因影响，其智力水平和死亡率在多达程度上是联系在一起的。
Among the most informative exercises we can undertake in cognitive epidemiology is to obtain a large group of twins on whom there is data on early-life intelligence and who were tracked for a long time to find out who had died.	我们在认知传染病学中可以进行的最为具有说明意义的研究就是掌握一大组双胞胎。 我们拥有这些双胞胎的早年智力数据并且长时间进行跟踪发现谁死亡。
We haven’t yet come across a large enough group of twins with such data.	我们目前还没有找到具有这些数据的足够数量的双胞胎组。
Finding one is a priority.	找到这一群组是��务之急。
The ultimate aim of this research is to find out what intelligent people have and do that enables them to live longer.	这一研究的最终目的就是发现高智力具有哪些东西及行为让他们更为长寿。
Once we know that, we will be able to share and apply that knowledge with the aim of achieving optimal health for all.	我们一旦知道，就可以分享和应用这一知识，目的在于为大众实现最佳健康。
	
Growth Out of Time	超越时间的增长
CAMBRIDGE – Robert Gordon of Northwestern University is a distinguished economist whose work in macroeconomics and studies of long-term economic growth have properly earned him high regard.	发自剑桥 — — 美国西北大学的罗伯特·戈登（Robert Gordon）是位杰出的经济学家，他在宏观经济学方面的成就以及对长期经济增长的研究为其赢得了高度评价。
So his recent exercise in speculative future history, which asks whether economic growth in the United States has come to an end, has attracted much favorable attention.	因此近期戈登在推测未来历史上的研究 — — 关于美国的经济增长期是否已经结束了 — — 引发了众多关注。
But a basic flaw in Gordon’s argument is immediately apparent – and becomes glaringly so on closer examination.	但其论据的一个基本缺陷却是显而易见的 — — 而且越是仔细观察这个缺陷就越明显。
Gordon distinguishes three Industrial Revolutions that have driven economic growth and improved living standards since the eighteenth century: IR #1 (“steam, railroads”), whose defining inventions date from 1750 to 1830; IR #2 (“electricity, internal combustion engine, running water, indoor toilets, communications, entertainment, chemicals, petroleum”), whose defining inventions date from 1870 to 1900; and IR #3 (“computers, the web, mobile phones”), dating from 1960.	戈登区分了自18世纪以来推动经济增长并提高生活水平的三次工业革命：第一次工业革命 （ “ 蒸汽、铁路 ” ） ，其决定性的发明都在1750年到1830年之间产生；第二次工业革命 （ “ 电力、内燃机、自来水、室内厕所、通讯、娱乐、化工、石油 ” ） ，其决定性发明在1870年到1900年间出现；第三次工业革命 （ “ 计算机、网络、手机 ” ） ，发明的起始日期定为1960年。
The core of his article contrasts the transformational impact of IR #1 and, especially, IR #2 on per capita GDP and the quality of life with the relatively trivial consequences of IR #3.	他的文章主要对比了第一次工业革命及第二次工业革命（尤其是后者对人均GDP和生活质量的影响）的变革性影响以及第三次工业革命相比之下较为细微的影响。
The vulnerability of Gordon’s argument is his shortened time horizon for IR #3.	戈登论证的薄弱之处在于他缩短了第三次工业革命的时间范围。
Consider the following four sentences in his paper:	细想一下出现在其文章中的四句话：
· “Both the first two revolutions required about 100 years for their full effects to percolate through the economy.”	· “前两次工业革命都需要100年的时间来让其全面影响渗透到经济层面 。 ”
· “At a minimum, it took 150 years for IR #1 to have its full range of effects.”	· “第一次工业革命至少需要150年的时间来实现其全面影响 。 ”
· “The inventions of IR #2 were so important…that they took a full 100 years to have their main effect.”	· “第二次工业革命的发明是如此重要，以至于要整整100年来展现其影响 。 ”
· “…[T]he productivity impact of IR #3 evaporated after only eight years, compared to the 81 years (1891-1972) required for the benefits of IR #2 to have their full impact…”	· “第三次工业革命的生产力影响作用在8年后就消失了，相比之下，第二次工业革命等待了81年（1891-1972）的时间才全面铺开 … … ”
The last sentence is crucial: Gordon cuts off IR #3 circa 2005 – that is, 45 years from its onset, but less than half the time allowed for IR #1 and IR #2 to run their respective courses.	最后一句至关重要：戈登把3号工业革命于2005年切断了 — — 也就是说自其发明始才存在45年，比第一和第二次工业革命得以运行的时间的一半还要短。
To take a salient example from the prior industrial revolutions, this is as if the impact of the railroads on the US economy were to be measured as of 1873, 45 years after construction began on America’s first line, the Baltimore & Ohio.	从之前的工业革命找一个显著的例子，这就好比在1873年衡量铁路对美国经济的影响 — — 也就是美国开始在巴尔的摩和俄亥俄州建设第一条铁路的45年之后就衡量其对经济的影响。
In 1873, the retailer Montgomery Ward was just a year old, and the first Sears Roebuck catalogue was still 20 years away.	1873年，零售商蒙哥马利·沃德才仅仅创建1年，而西尔斯·罗巴克的第一份商品目录还要等20年后才出现。
Together, these companies invented mail order as the “killer app” of the railroad age, creating a continental market for consumer goods, with all of the economies of scale that followed.	而正是这些公司一起发明了邮购 — — 它成为了铁路时代的“杀手级应用 ” ， 为日常消费品创造了一个横跨整个大陆的市场，其他所有的规模范畴也随之兴起。
Or, to take another example, what if we stopped measuring the economic impact of electrification only 45 years after the first generating plant, Thomas Edison’s Pearl Street Station, became operational in 1882?	或者，用���外一个例子，如果我们在第一个发电厂出现的45年之后就停下来衡量电气化的影响会怎样呢？ 托马斯·爱迪生（Thomas Edison）的珍珠街发电站在1882年开始运行。
At that point, America’s manufacturing industries were just discovering the benefits of flexible (re)configuration, which enabled distribution of generated electric power, while America’s home-appliance industry was in its infancy.	那时美国的制造业才开始发现灵活配置电力的好处，这使得分配产生的电力成为可能，而当时的美国家电产业尚处于起步阶段。
Gordon asserts that “the era of computers replacing human labor was largely over” during the past decade.	戈登断言过去十年“计算机替代人类劳动的时代在很大程度上已经结束了 ” 。
Innovation in information and communications technology (ICT) focused first on electronic commerce, “itself largely completed by 2005.”	在信息和通讯技术上的创新首先集中在电子商务上 ， “ 其本身的创新到2005为止已经在很大程度上完成了 。 ”
After that, “labor-saving innovation” took a back seat to “a succession of entertainment and communication devices that do the same things as we could do before, but now in smaller and more convenient packages.”	在那之后 ， “ 节省劳力的创新”让位于“一系列的娱乐和通讯设备 — — 这些设备做的事情与我们过去能做的是一样的，只不过现在的封装得更小更便捷 。 ”
In thus truncating and trivializing the ongoing ICT revolution, Gordon misses two fundamental processes.	就这样截断并贬低正在前进的信息通讯技术革命，戈登漏掉了两个最基本的过程。
First, and most evident, the rise of e-commerce is far from over.	首先，也是最明显的，电子商务的兴起还远未结束。
In the US, the most advanced country in this respect, e-commerce has just reached 10% of total retail spending, and is continuing to grow at double-digit rates through the slow recovery from the Great Recession.	在美国 — — 这方面最先进的国家，电子商务达到了零售支出总额的10 % ， 并在从大萧条的缓慢恢复过程中继续以2位数的速度增长。
At the same time, something much more significant is happening beneath the economic surface.	同时，更重要的是在经济表面下发生的事情。
From the early days of the computer revolution, researchers and popularizers envisioned “artificial intelligence” as the ultimate killer app (literally, in the case of the computer HAL in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey).	在计算机革命初期，研究人员与推广者把人工智能设想为终极杀手锏（从字面上来看，就是电影《2001太空漫游》中的电脑HAL ） 。
Decades of frustration are now yielding to success: the application of sophisticated statistical techniques to the accelerating accumulation of unprecedented quantities of so-called Big Data that the Internet simultaneously generates and captures.	而过去数十年的挫败如今正转化为成功：复杂的统计技术被应用于由互联网同时产生并截获的所谓“大数据”中加速积累的，前所未有的海量信息。
For proof of artificial intelligent “life,” consider the “virtual assistants” populating smart phones, beginning – but just beginning – with Apple’s Siri.	要证明人工智能拥有“生命 ” ， 试想一下流行于智能手机的“虚拟助理 ” — —它始于 — — 而且仅仅是开始 — — 苹果的智能语音组件Siri。
The next wave of IR #3’s consequences can be discerned in systems that capture the intention behind a search request and couple it to a completed transaction, and in the application of predictive analytics to industrial supply chains and service provisioning.	第三次工业革命所引发的影响可以在那些捕捉每个搜索请求背后的动机并将其与一个已完成的交易相匹配的系统中识别出来，也可以在预测分析产业供应链和服务配置的应用上找到踪影。
If these innovations’ prospective impact on productivity and GDP growth cannot be quantified, well, that is the way it is with future history.	即便这些创新对生产率和GDP增长的潜在影响暂时无法被量化，但这必将在未来的历史得到实现。
Flawed as Gordon’s reading of IR #3 is, his concluding concern for the future of innovation in the US is well founded.	即使戈登对第三次工业革命的解读有误，他对美国创新未来走向的结论也是有充分理由的。
Of the assorted “headwinds” that he cites, the enormous increase in inequality and the plateau reached in educational attainment represent threats that differentiate America’s position from that of other advanced countries.	在他所引用的各种“逆风”因素中，不平等状况的大幅恶化以及教育成就的停滞代表了那些将美国的地位与其他发达国家区分开来的威胁。
But Gordon ignores the greatest threat to continued US global leadership in innovation: the delegitimation over the past generation of the state’s role as an economic actor.	但是戈登忽略了保持美国创新全球领导地位的最大威胁：在过去一代人的岁月中国家丧失了作为经济行动者的合法性。
As I illustrate and analyze at length in my new book, Doing Capitalism in the Innovation Economy: Markets, Speculation and the State, the state has become central to the Innovation Economy’s dynamics.	正如我在新书《在创新经济中施行资本主义：市场、投机和国家》说明与分析的一样，国家已经成为创新经济动力的关键。
It funds the upstream research that generates discovery and invention; supports the creation of new networks, from canals to the Internet; and serves as a creative customer for innovative products, as it did during the computer revolution’s nascence.	它资助能产生发现和发明的上游研究；支持新网络的建立 — — 无论是从前的运河还是如今的互联网；同时也作为创新产品的消费者，正如其在计算机革命发生时所做的一样。
The state must also preserve continuity in the market economy when the speculative bubble that has funded its transformation bursts.	国家还必须在引发市场转型的投机泡沫爆破时保持市场经济的持续性。
And here, too, Gordon disappoints.	在这方面，戈登的论述也不尽如人意。
The only reference to government in his paper is not even to this stabilizing role. Rather, it is to the asserted headwind represented by the very debt incurred to prevent the global financial crisis of 2008 from triggering a second Great Depression.	其论文中唯一涉及政府的参考文献甚至还不是关于政府稳定作用有关的，而是为了说明防止2008年全球金融危机引发第二次大萧条而产生的债务是“逆风 ” 。
	
The Truth About Sovereignty	关于主权的真相
CAMBRIDGE – In the French parliament’s recent debate on Europe’s new fiscal treaty, the country’s Socialist government vehemently denied that ratification of the treaty would undermine French sovereignty.	美国剑桥—最近，法国议会对欧洲新财政条约进行了讨论，社会党政府义正辞严地否认批准这一条约有损于法国的主权。
It places “not one constraint on the level of public spending,” Jean-Marc Ayrault, the prime minister, asserted. “Budget sovereignty remains in the parliament of the French Republic.”	它“并没有在公共支出方面形成约束 ， ” 总理埃罗声称 ， “ 预算主权仍在法兰西共和国议会手中 。 ”
As Ayrault was trying to reassure his skeptical colleagues, including many members of his own party, European Commissioner for Competition Joaquin Almunia was delivering a similar message to his fellow social democrats in Brussels.	在埃罗试图让其怀疑派同事 — — 包括许多社会党同志 — — 放心的同时，负责竞争事务的欧洲委员阿尔穆尼亚（Joaquin Almunia）也在布鲁塞尔向其社会民主党同志传递相同的信息。
To succeed, he argued, Europe must prove wrong those who believe there is a conflict between globalization and sovereignty.	他指出，要想成功，欧洲就必须证明，那些认为全球化和主权之间存在冲突的人是错的。
Nobody likes to give up national sovereignty, least of all, it seems, politicians on the left.	没人愿意放弃国家主权，左翼政客尤其如此。
Yet, by denying the obvious fact that the eurozone’s viability depends on substantial restraints on sovereignty, Europe’s leaders are misleading their voters, delaying the Europeanization of democratic politics, and raising the political and economic costs of the ultimate reckoning.	但是，否认欧元区之生存严重依赖于对主权的约束这一事实表明，欧洲领导人正在误导选民，民主政治的欧洲化进程将因此延迟，最终醒悟的政治和经济成本也会因此提高。
The eurozone aspires to full economic integration, which entails the elimination of transaction costs that impede cross-border commerce and finance.	欧元区最求的是完全的经济一体化，包括消除阻碍跨国商业和金融的交易成本。
Obviously, it requires that governments renounce direct restrictions on trade and capital flows.	显然，这要求各国政府抛弃对贸易和资本流的直接限制。
But it also requires that they harmonize their domestic rules and regulations – such as product-safety standards and bank regulations – with those of other member states in order to ensure they do not act as indirect trade barriers.	但这同样要求各国政府协调各自的国内法规和监管 — — 如产品安全标准和银行监管 — — 已确保这些因素不会构成间接贸易壁垒。
And governments must forswear changes in these policies, lest the uncertainty itself act as a transaction cost.	各国政府还不能对这方面的政策朝令夕改，因为不确定性本身会就会形成交易成本。
This was all implicit in the European Union’s single-market initiative.	这些都是欧盟单一市场方案的应有之义。
The eurozone went one step further, aiming through monetary unification to eradicate fully the transaction costs associated with national currencies and exchange-rate risk.	欧元区则更进一步，旨在形成完全的货币联盟，彻底消除与国家货币和汇率风险有关的交易成本。
Simply put, the European integration project has hinged on restrictions on national sovereignty.	简单说，欧洲一体化工程的瓶颈就在于国家主权的限制。
If its future is now in doubt, it is because sovereignty stands in the way once again.	如今，其前景之所以可疑，是因为主权再一次挡在了前进的道路上。
In a true economic union, underpinned by union-wide political institutions, the financial problems of Greece, Spain, and the others would not have blown up to their current proportions, threatening the existence of the union itself.	在一个以泛联盟政治制度为基础的真正的经济联盟中，希腊、西班牙和其他国家的财政问题不会演变到如今的威胁到联盟本身生存的程度。
Consider the United States.	就拿美国来说吧。
No one even keeps track of, say, Florida’s current-account deficit with the rest of the country, although we can safely guess that it is huge (since the state is home to many retirees living off benefits that come from elsewhere).	根本不会有人关心（比如）佛罗里达州对美国其余部分的经常项目赤字，尽管我们可以大胆猜测这笔赤字不会小（因为大量来自其他地区的依靠退休福利生活的退休人士生活在佛罗里达州 ） 。
When Florida’s state government goes bankrupt, Florida’s banks continue to operate normally, because they are under federal rather than state jurisdiction.	当佛罗里达州政府陷入破产时，佛罗里达银行仍能正常经营，因为监管它们的是联邦政府，而不是州政府。
When Florida’s banks go belly-up, state finances are insulated, because the banks are ultimately the responsibility of federal institutions.	当佛罗里达州银行倒闭时，州财政不会受到影响，因为说到底银行是联邦机构的责任。
When Florida’s workers become unemployed, they get unemployment checks from Washington, DC.	当佛罗里达州工人失业时，他们从华盛顿获得失业救济。
And when Florida’s voters are disenchanted about the economy, they do not riot outside the state capital; they put pressure on their representatives in Congress to push for changes in federal policies.	而当佛罗里达州选民对经济彻底失望时，他们也不会在州首府闹事；他们会对他们在国会的代表施压，要求联邦政策有所反应。
Nobody would argue that US states have an abundance of sovereignty.	没人会争论说美国各州拥有充分的主权。
The relationship between sovereignty and democracy is also misunderstood.	主权和民主的关系也被误解了。
Not all restrictions on the exercise of sovereign power are undemocratic.	并非所有对主权权力的执行的限制都是非民主的。
Political scientists talk about “democratic delegation” – the idea that a sovereign might want to tie its hands (through international commitments or delegation to autonomous agencies) in order to achieve better outcomes.	政治学词叫“民主授权 ” ， 说的是君主可能甘愿自缚双手（通过国际承诺或授权自治机构）以追求更好的结果。
The delegation of monetary policy to an independent central bank is the archetypal example: in the service of price stability, daily management of monetary policy is insulated from politics.	将货币政策授权给独立央行就是原生的例子：在维持价格稳定这个问题上，货币政策的日常管理从政治中独立出来了。
Even if selective limitations on sovereignty may enhance democratic performance, there is no guarantee that all limitations implied by market integration would do so.	即便是对主权施以有选择的限制也有可能加强民主表现，没人能够保证市场一体化所隐含的限制能够做到这一点。
In domestic politics, delegation is carefully calibrated and restricted to a few areas where the issues tend to be highly technical and partisan differences are not large.	在民主政治中，授权将得到仔细审议，并被限制于有限的领域 — — 那些问题具有高度技术性且党派差异不大的领域。
A truly democracy-enhancing globalization would respect these boundaries.	真正能够强化民主的全球化会尊重这些界限。
It would impose only those limits that are consistent with democratic delegation, possibly along with a limited number of procedural norms (such as transparency, accountability, representativeness, use of scientific evidence, etc.) that enhance democratic deliberation at home.	其所施加的限制将与民主授权一致，大致上遵循能够增进国内民主自由化的有限的程序范式（比如透明度、可问责性、代议制、使用科学证据，等等 ） 。
As the American example illustrates, it is possible to give up on sovereignty – as Florida, Texas, California, and the other US states have done – without giving up on democracy.	正如美国的例子所标明的，放弃主权 — — 佛罗里达、德克萨斯、加利福尼亚，美国各州都是如此 — — 并不一定意味着放弃民主。
But combining market integration with democracy requires the creation of supranational political institutions that are representative and accountable.	但将市场一体化与民主结合起来要求创造代议制、可问责的跨国政治机构。
The conflict between democracy and globalization becomes acute when globalization restricts the domestic articulation of policy preferences without a compensating expansion of democratic space at the regional/global level.	如果全球化限制了国内政策偏好的表达，同时民主空间又无法在地区/全球水平进行补偿性扩张，那么民主和全球化之间的冲突就会激烈起来。
Europe is already on the wrong side of this boundary, as the political unrest in Spain and Greece indicates.	西班牙和希腊的政治动荡表明，欧洲已经陷入了这一错误的区域。
That is where my political trilemma begins to bite: We cannot have globalization, democracy, and national sovereignty simultaneously.	这就是我的政治三难：我们无法同时实现全球化、民主和国家主权。
We must choose two among the three.	我们必须在三者中选择两个。
If European leaders want to maintain democracy, they must make a choice between political union and economic disintegration.	如果欧洲领导人要维持民主，那么他们必须在政治联盟和经济分裂中选择。
They must either explicitly renounce economic sovereignty or actively put it to use for the benefit of their citizens.	他们要么选择完全放弃经济主权，要么积极用经济主权来为本国公民造福。
The first would entail coming clean with their own electorates and building democratic space above the level of the nation-state.	前一个选择要求他们向自己的选民说实话，并建设超越民族国家水平的民主空间。
The second would mean giving up on monetary union in order to be able to deploy national monetary and fiscal policies in the service of longer-term recovery.	后一个选择意味着放弃货币联盟，从而得以实施旨在提振长期复苏的国家货币和财政政策。
The longer this choice is postponed, the greater the economic and political cost that ultimately will have to be paid.	这一选择被拖得越久，最终必须付出的经济和政治成本就越大。
	
Economic Policy’s Narrative Imperative	经济政策的故事动力
WASHINGTON, DC – The best advice I received when taking up policymaking responsibilities in Turkey more than a decade ago was to take “a lot of time and care to develop and communicate the ‘narrative’ to support the policy program that you want to succeed.”	华盛顿—十多年前我负责土耳其的政策制定，我所听到的最佳建议是“把大量时间和精力花在发展和传达一种‘故事’来支持你所想让其成功的政策计划上 。 ”
The more that economic policy is subject to public debate – that is, the more democracy there is – the more important such policy narratives are.	经济政策越是容易引起公共争论 — — 即民主成分越多 — — 政策故事的重要性就越大。
The crisis faced by the European Union and the eurozone is a telling example of the need for a narrative that explains public policy and generates political support for it.	欧盟和欧元区所面临的危机就是很好的例子，说明了能解释公共政策并激发对政策的政治支持的故事的重要性。
A successful narrative can be neither too complicated nor simplistic.	成功的故事既不能太复杂，也不能太简单。
It must capture the imagination, address the public’s anxieties, and generate realistic hope.	它必须抓住眼球、解决公众的焦虑并激发现实希望。
Voters often sense cheap populism.	选民通常会感冒于廉价的民粹主义。
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi provided such a narrative to the financial markets last July.	去年7月，欧洲中央银行行长德拉吉就为金融市场提供了这样一种故事。
He said that the ECB would do everything necessary to prevent the disintegration of the euro, adding simply: “Believe me, it will be enough.”	他说欧洲央行将做任何该做之事防止欧元解体，并且言简意赅地加了一句 ： “ 相信我，这就够了 。 ”
With that sentence, Draghi eliminated the perceived re-denomination tail risk that was highest in the case of Greece, but that was driving up borrowing costs in Spain, Italy, and Portugal as well.	德拉吉用这句话消除了人们所感到的重新计价尾部风险 — — 这一风险在希��最高，但也推高了西班牙、意大利和葡萄牙的借贷成本。
It was not a populist message, because the ECB does indeed have the firepower to buy enough sovereign bonds on the secondary market to put a ceiling on interest rates, at least for many months.	这不是民粹主义说辞，因为欧洲央行真有在二级市场购买足够多主权证券从而将利率限制在某个水平之下的实力，至少在若干个月内是如此。
Central bankers, more generally, are typically able to provide short- or medium-term narratives to financial markets.	更一般地说，央行行长通常都有能力向市场提供短期和中期故事。
US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke provided his own by pledging that US short-term interest rates would remain very low, and the Bank of Japan’s new chairman, Haruhiko Kuroda, has just provided another by saying that he will double the money supply so that inflation reaches 2%.	美联储主席伯南克也这么做了 — — 他承诺美国短期利率将维持极低水平；日本银行新行长黑田东彦最近也如法炮制了一次 — — 他宣布会将货币供应量扩大一倍，让通胀达到2 % 。
While central bankers can provide such narratives to financial markets, it is political leaders who must provide the overall socioeconomic messages that encourage long-term real investment, electoral support for reform, and hope for the future.	尽管央行行长可以向金融市场提供这类故事，但要鼓励长期真实投资、激发选民支持改革、点燃未来希望，还是要靠政治领袖给出总体社会经济承诺。
Central bank alchemy, to borrow a term from the US journalist Neil Irwin’s new book, has its limits.	央行炼金术 — — 借用美国记者尼尔·埃尔文（Neil Irwin）新著的用词 — — 总归有限。
Europe, in particular, needs a narrative of long-term hope that will trigger a real recovery.	特别是欧洲，它需要带来长期希望的故事，触发真正的复苏。
France is coming closer to the danger zone, and even Germany’s annual GDP growth is falling well below 1% per year.	法国正在接近危险区，甚至德国的年GDP增长也会大大低于每年1 % 。
In the meantime, the easing of sovereign interest-rate spreads provides little comfort to the growing army of unemployed in southern Europe, where youth unemployment has reached dramatic heights – close to 60% in Greece and Spain, and almost 40% in Italy.	与此同时，主权利差的放松并没有让南欧日渐庞大的失业大军更好过 — — 年轻人失业纷纷达到了极高的数字，希腊和西班牙接近60 % ， 意大利接近40 % 。
The narrative should address three essential questions.	故事要解决三大关键问题。
How can the European model of strong social solidarity and security be reformed, but endure?	欧洲强大的社会团结和安全模式如何改革并维系？
How can economic growth be revived and sustained throughout the EU?	如何重振经济增长并在整个欧盟维持？
And how can Europe’s institutions function with enhanced legitimacy to accommodate countries that share the euro and others that retain their national currencies?	如何增加欧洲机构的合法性以协调共用欧元和保有本国货币的国家？
For starters, a revolution is required in the organization of work, learning, and leisure.	首先，工作、学习和休闲的组织必须改变。
Social solidarity, essential to European identity, can and must include longer work lives, but also more work-sharing, adult learning, and shorter average work weeks (particularly close to retirement).	社会团结是欧洲身份认同的关键，它可以并必须包括更长的工作寿命，也可以并必须包括更大的工作共担、成人教育和更短的工作周（特别是在接近退休时 ） 。
Such flexibility requires the consent of all: employees must adjust to changing requirements; employers must re-organize their enterprises to allow more work-sharing, work from home, and learning intervals; and governments must overhaul taxes, income support, and regulation to promote a “flex-solidarity revolution” that encourages personal choice and responsibility, while remaining committed to social cohesion.	如此灵活度要求所有人的一致意见：雇员必须调整适应变化的要求；雇主必须重新组织企业允许更多的工作分担、在家办公和脱产学习；政府必须修正税收、收入支持和监管以促进鼓励个人选择和责任的“灵活团结革命 ” ， 同时继续致力于增进社会凝聚。
This can lead to a better future for all, with citizens gaining better access to adult education, having more free time to pursue personal interests, and remaining productive and occupationally engaged far longer into their healthy lives.	这能给所有人带来更加美好的未来，公民有更多的机会获得成人教育，拥有更多的自由时间追求个人兴趣，并大大延长健康岁月的生产率和就业时间。
Europe does not need Asia’s rates of economic growth.	欧洲不需要亚洲那样的经济增长率。
It can secure decent jobs and prosperity, with a sustained annual growth rate of around 2%.	2%左右的持续年增长率就可以让它保持体面的就业和繁荣。
To achieve that, German voters should be told not that their country’s resources will forever flow to Spain, but that their wages can rise at twice the rate of the recent past without risking inflation or a current-account deficit, because Germany has the world’s largest external surplus.	要达到这一点，德国选民应该明白该国的资源将永远流向西班牙，但他们的工资可以以两倍于当前的速度增长而不导致通货膨胀和经常项目赤字，因为德国拥有世界最大的外部盈余。
Service-sector industries throughout the EU must be opened up.	整个欧盟的服务行业必须开放。
The countries with stronger fiscal positions should take the lead in a major pan-European skill-upgrading program.	财政状况更好的国家应该率先推出大规模泛欧洲技能升级计划。
The number of pan-European scholarships should be doubled.	泛欧洲奖学金数量应该翻番。
School programs everywhere should aim to educate trilingual citizens.	各地学校项目应该定位于培养能说三种语言的公民。
Moreover, a full European banking union with shared resources for resolution should be created without further delay.	此外，应该成立清算资源共享的完全的欧洲银行联盟，这一点已不容再拖。
The European Investment Bank, which received a significant capital increase in 2012, should add a large investment-support program for medium-size enterprises to its current operations, with a subsidy financed from the European budget to encourage first-time job takers for a limited period.	2012年，欧洲投资银行的资本金获得了极大提升，它应该在现有业务的基础上增加一个面向中等企业的投资支持计划，由欧洲预算出资为初次就业者提供临时性津贴以示鼓励。
Jobs and training for young people must be the centerpiece for the new growth pact, and projects must move ahead in “crisis mode,” rather than according to business as usual.	新增长契约必须以年轻人就业和培训为核心，各项目必须对“危机模式”未雨绸缪，而不是根据正常情况的业务模式制定。
Finally, while monetary union obviously requires greater sharing of sovereignty, there should also be a “greater Europe” that includes the United Kingdom and others.	最后，货币联盟明确要求更大程度的主权共享，与此同时，也应该有一个包括英国和其他国家在内的“大欧洲 ” 。
This implies two-tier institutions that can accommodate both types of countries: the “euro-ins” and those that prefer to preserve their monetary sovereignty in a larger Europe built around a vibrant single market and common democratic values.	这意味着两套机构共存，以协调两种国家 ： “ 欧元国 ” （ euro-in）和更愿意在以强健的单一市场和共同民主价值为基础的大欧洲中保留货币主权的国家。
These interconnected visions can and must be realized if Europe is to thrive again.	这些相互交融的愿景可以也必须实现，如果欧洲意在重振雄风的话。
Together, they form a compelling narrative that European leaders must begin to articulate.	它们合在一起就形成了欧洲领导人必须现在就开始宣扬的故事。
	
Why Eurobonds are Un-American	为什么说欧元债券不是美国式的
BRUSSELS – The emerging consensus in Europe nowadays is that only “debt mutualization” in the form of Eurobonds can resolve the euro crisis, with advocates frequently citing the early United States, when Alexander Hamilton, President George Washington’s treasury secretary, successfully pressed the new federal government to assume the Revolutionary War debts of America’s states.	布鲁塞尔—目前，欧洲的新共识是只有通过欧元债券将“债务共同化”才能拯救欧元危机，该方案的鼓吹者频繁引用美国早期的历史，当时华盛顿政府的财政部长汉密尔顿成功地迫使新联邦政府揽下美国各州的独立战争债。
But a closer look reveals that this early US experience provides neither a useful analogy nor an encouraging precedent for Eurobonds.	但若更仔细地考察就能发现，美国建国之初的经验既算不上是有用的类比，也绝不是欧洲债券令人鼓舞的先例。
First, taking over a stock of existing state debt at the federal level is very different from allowing individual member states to issue bonds with “joint and several” liability underwritten by all member states collectively.	首先，揽下现存州债务转换为联邦债务与允许个别成员国发行所有成员国共同兜底的“连带”责任债券是截然不同的。
Hamilton did not have to worry about moral hazard, because the federal government did not guarantee any new debt incurred by the states.	汉密尔顿并不需要担心道德风险，因为联邦政府并不对任何州级新债提供担保。
Second, it is seldom mentioned that US federal debt at the time (around $40 million) was much larger than that of the states (about $18 million).	其次，很少被提及的是，当时美国联邦债务（约4000万美元）比各州债务（约1800万美元）多得多。
Thus, assuming state debt was not central to the success of post-war financial stabilization in the new country; rather, it was a natural corollary of the fact that most of the debt had been incurred fighting for a common cause.	因此，将州债务揽下并不是美国独立战争后实现金融稳定性的中心原因，相反，这只是大部分债务起源于为统统目标而战这一事实的自然结果。
Moreover, the most efficient sources of government revenues at the time were tariffs and taxes collected at the external border.	此外，当时，最高效的的政府收入之源是关税和取自外部边界的税收。
Even from an efficiency point of view, it made sense to have the federal government service public debt.	即使从有效性的角度看，让联邦政府来为公债买单也是有道理可循的。
Federal assumption of the states’ war debts also yielded an advantage in terms of economic development: once states no longer had any debt, they had no need to raise any revenues through direct taxation, which might have impeded the growth of America’s internal market.	联邦将各州战争债揽下还产生了经济发展的优势：各州卸下了战无负担，因此不必通过可能阻碍美国内部市场发展的直接税开源。
Indeed, after the federal government assumed the states’ debt (already a small part of the total), state revenues fell by 80-90%.	事实上，在联邦政府揽下各州债务（只是总债务的小头）后，各州岁入下降了80—90 % 。
The states then became for some time fiscally irrelevant.	各州也因此在一段时间内不必担心财政状况。
Finally, the key to the success of financial stabilization was a profound restructuring.	最后，金融稳定成功的关键是深化重组。
Hamilton estimated that the federal government could raise enough revenues to pay approximately 4% interest on the total amount of debt to be serviced – significantly less than the 6% yield on the existing obligations.	汉密尔顿估算，联邦政府能够征收足够的岁入承担的总债务4%的利率 — — 比当时债务存量6%的收益率低多了。
Holders of both state and federal bonds were thus offered a basket of long-dated bonds, some with an interest rate of 3%, and others with 6 % (with a ten-year grace period).	州债券和联邦债券持有者将获得一篮子长期债券，其中一些利率为3 % ， 另一些为6 % （ 但有10年宽限期 ） 。
The basket was designed in such a way as to result in an average debt-service cost of 4%.	这个债务篮子的平均债务利息成本的4 % 。
In modern terms, the “net present value” of the total debt (federal and state) was reduced by about one-half if one were to apply the usual exit yield of 9%.	从现代观点看，这样一来，与以当时常见的到期收益率9%相比，总债务（包括联邦债务和州债务）的“净现值”被削减了一半。
Moreover, the new federal bonds’ very long maturities meant that there was no rollover risk.	此外，新的联邦债券极长的到期期限意味着不存在展期风险。
It would have been very dangerous to expose the federal government to this danger, given that the operation was rightly perceived at the outset as extremely risky.	联邦政府暴露于这一风险之下是十分危险的，如果这一操作从一开始就被正确地意识到风险极高的话。
For the country’s first few years, debt service swallowed more than 80% of all federal revenues.	在美国建国的最初几年中，债务利息吞噬了80%的联邦总岁入。
The slightest negative shock could have bankrupted the new federal government.	只要发生一丝负面冲击，就能让新成立的联邦政府破产。
Fortunately, the opposite happened: federal revenues tripled under the impact of a rapid post-war reconstruction boom, and continued to grow rapidly, aided by the country’s ability to remain neutral while wars ravaged the European continent.	幸运的是，情况正好相反：受战后重建繁荣刺激，联邦岁入增长了三倍，并因为美国在斩获蹂躏欧洲大陆时保持中立而持续快速增长。
By contrast, growth prospects in Europe today are rather dim, and interest payments, even for Greece or Italy, account for less than 20% of total revenues.	与美国相反，如今欧洲的增长前景十分黯淡，而即使是意大利和希腊，利息支付也只占总岁入的20 % 。
The real problem is the rollover of existing debt in a stagnating economy.	真正的问题是在经济停滞的情况下展期现有债务。
For example, Italy will soon have a balanced budget in structural terms, but must still face the problem of refinancing old debt as it matures each year.	比如，从结构上说，意大利很快就会实现平衡预算，但它仍必须面对为每年到期的旧债再融资的问题。
Assuaging doubt about the sustainability of public debt in the eurozone would thus probably require a deep restructuring as well.	因此，要缓和关于欧元区公债可持续性的质疑，可能也需要深刻的结构重组。
The eurozone crisis could certainly be resolved if all existing public debt were transformed into 20-year Eurobonds with a yield of 3%, and a five-year grace period on debt service.	如果现有债务转换为20年期、收益率3%的欧元债券，并得到5年利息宽限期，那么欧元区危机肯定能够解决。
One can easily anticipate the impact that this would have on financial markets.	你一眼就能看出这个方案对金融市场会造成什么影响。
More interesting in view of the current situation in the eurozone is what followed roughly a half-century after Hamilton acted.	对于如何看待欧元区现状这个问题，更有意思的办法是看看汉密尔顿方案出台后五十年发生了什么。
In the 1830’s and 1840’s, a number of states had over-invested in the leading transport technology of the time – canals.	在19世纪20年代和30年代，很多州在当时领先的运输技术 — — 运河上投资过度。
When the canal-building boom ended, eight states and the Territory of Florida (accounting for about 10% of the entire US population at the time) were unable to service their debt and defaulted on their, mostly British, loans.	运河挖掘繁荣结束时，佛罗里达领地的八个州（当时占美国全国人口的10 % ） 无法支付债务利息，不得不违约（其中大部分是对英国的债务 ） 。
British bankers threatened that they would never again invest in these untrustworthy Americans.	英国银行家威胁说，他们绝不会再向这群没有信誉的美国佬投钱。
They could point to the precedent set by Hamilton, and had probably invested on the implicit understanding that, if necessary, the federal government would bail out the states again.	他们大概是受了汉密尔顿先例的误导，他们之所以投资，是因为他们认为联邦政府（如果必要的话）会再次出手拯救各州。
But, despite foreign creditors’ threats, the federal government did not come to the rescue.	但是，尽管有外国债权人的威胁，联邦政府仍拒绝出手援助。
The bailout request did not succeed because it could not muster a simple majority of the states (represented by the Senate) and the population (represented by the House of Representatives) under the normal decision-making procedure (the “Community method,” in European Union jargon).	援助要求没有成功，因为根据常规决策程序（用欧盟的话说，叫“共同体方法 ” ） ，这需要州（由参议院代表）和人口（由众议院代表）简单多数的批准，而援助要求没有获得简单多数。
The defaults proved to be costly.	违约的代价是沉重的。
The 1840’s were a period of slow growth, and continued pressure from foreign creditors forced most of the official debtors to resume payments after a while.	19世纪40年代，美国增长缓慢，来自外国债权人源源不断的压力迫使大部分官方债务人在一段时间后重新履行偿还义务。
Default was not an easy way out, and all US states (with the exception of Vermont) have since embraced balanced-budget amendments to their constitutions as a way to shore up their fiscal credibility.	违约不是简单的解决之道，此后，所有美国州（只有佛蒙特州是例外）都在州宪法中加入了平衡预算修正案，以此捍卫财政信誉。
Are EU members prepared to take a similar step?	欧盟成员国准备好采取类似动作了吗？
	
Europe’s Asian Pivot	欧洲的亚洲重心
CAMBRIDGE/OXFORD – The Obama administration’s so-called “pivot to Asia” is the most important strategic shift that the United States has undertaken since the end of the Cold War – and it has profound implications for Europe.	剑桥/牛津—奥巴马政府的“亚洲重心”是美国自冷战结束以来最重要的战略变化 — — 它对欧洲有着深远的影响。
But Europe’s leaders have largely ignored or misunderstood its significance, and thus have failed to seize the opportunity that it represents.	但欧洲领导人大多忽视或误解了它的重要性，因而没能抓住它所带来的机会。
For example, some in Europe believe that America’s interest in Asia is a recent development.	比如，一些欧洲人认为美国对亚洲的兴趣是最近才发展起来的。
But, as President Barack Obama put it in 2011, “The US has been, and always will be, a Pacific nation.”	但是，正如奥巴马在2011年所指出的 ， “ 美国已经是、未来也将一直是太平洋国家 。 ”
The shift is aimed at ensuring that the US plays “a larger and long-term role in shaping this region,” where it has long helped to maintain stability and contributed to unprecedented economic growth.	这一转变的目的是确保美国“在决定太平洋地区局势方面扮演更大、更长期的角色 ” ， 长期以来，美国帮助该地区实现了稳定和前所未有的经济增长。
Given this, America’s pivot should be viewed more as a consolidation of established policies than as an abrupt, short-term change.	基于此，美国的重心应该被视为对已有政策的整合，而不是突然的短期政策变化。
The policy’s scope is also widely misunderstood.	该政策的范围也往往被误解。
While the policy does include a rebalancing of America’s military posture in Asia – by 2020, the US Navy will deploy more of its forces, including six of its 11 carrier groups, to the Pacific Ocean – it covers the entire spectrum of diplomacy, economics, development, culture, and inter-societal relations.	它确实包括了美国亚洲军事部署的再平衡 — — 到2020年，美国海军将把主力部队（包括11个航母战斗群中的六个）部署在太平洋 — — 但也涵盖了外交、经济、发展、文化和跨社会关系的全方位内容。
This comprehensive approach is evident in Obama’s choice of destination for the first overseas trip of his second term.	这一套全面方案也体现在奥巴马第二任期的第一个出访对象的选择上。
By visiting Myanmar, Thailand, and Cambodia, Obama reinforced earlier efforts to strengthen diplomatic and economic engagement with the Asia-Pacific region.	他访问了缅甸、泰国和柬埔寨，进一步强化了早先加强亚太地区外交和经济参与的做法。
Furthermore, America officially joined the East Asia Summit in 2011, easing concerns in the region about China’s increasingly aggressive posture in the South China Sea.	此外，2011年美国正式加入了东亚峰会，缓解了东亚关于中国在南海越来越强硬的担忧。
Likewise, America’s proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership and offers of economic engagement to Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries are the latest initiatives underscoring its determination to strengthen its economic ties in the region.	类似地，美国提出的跨太平洋合作伙伴关系以及向东盟国家提供经济合作机会都是它强化与该地区经济合作决心的最新动作。
Such efforts to safeguard regional stability will ultimately benefit Europe, for which Asia has become an increasingly important trading partner.	这些捍卫地区稳定的动作最终将有利于欧洲。 对欧洲来说，亚洲已成为越来越重要的贸易伙伴。
Given the rising risk of conflict in Asia – owing to a toxic combination of rapid GDP growth, an arms race, historical resentments, rampant chauvinism, territorial disputes, and a lack of effective institutional arrangements for conflict resolution – Europe should welcome a stronger US presence in the region.	目前亚洲呈现出快速GDP增长、军备竞赛、历史仇恨、普遍的沙文主义、领土纠纷的危险组合，又缺少有效的制度性安排来解决冲突，因此发生冲突的风险很大，在这样的环境下，欧洲应该欢迎美国在该地区起到更大作用。
At the same time, Europe’s leaders must recognize that, by increasing its engagement in Asia, the US is not turning away from its European partners.	与此同时，欧洲领导人必须认识到，通过更多地参与亚洲，美国并没有与其欧洲伙伴国渐行渐远。
On the contrary, as US Vice President Joe Biden said in February, Europe remains “the cornerstone of [US] engagement with the rest of the world.”	相反，正如美国副总理拜登在2月所指出的，欧洲仍是“美国参与世界其他地区的基石 。 ”
US leaders are well aware of the geopolitical factors that make Europe their most important and reliable ally.	美国领导人非常明白让欧洲成为美国最重要、最可靠盟友的地缘政治因素。
Its proximity to the Middle East and Africa – where the European Union and its member countries are the most important aid donors, trading partners, and security actors – will ensure the partnership’s continued relevance, as will the common values and deep economic integration that underpin transatlantic relations.	欧洲靠近中东和非洲 — — 欧盟及其成员国是最重要的援助国、贸易伙伴和安全行动方 — — 这样的地理位置决定了美欧伙伴关系的重要性，除此之外，跨大西洋关系更有共同价值和深度经济一体化为基础。
But the rebalancing does have strategic implications for Europe.	但再平衡确实对欧洲形成了战略影响。
America’s military presence in Europe will be gradually reduced, as will its willingness to take the lead in international crises – even those affecting Europe’s interests.	美国在欧洲的军事部署将逐渐减弱，其领导国际危机干预的意愿亦然 — — 即使是对于影响欧洲利益的危机也是如此。
As a result, while the US will continue to provide intelligence, air support, and ammunition on a case-by-case basis, as it did recently in Libya and Mali, Europe will increasingly have to act first and alone.	因此，尽管美国将继续在危机发生时提供情报、空中支援和武器装备（如最近的利比亚和马里事件 ） ， 但欧洲将逐渐独立行动。
If Europe is to overcome its current financial constraints and acquire the military capacity and level of coordination needed to fulfill its new role, it must pool and share its resources more effectively.	如果欧洲要克服当前的金融约束、获得满足其新角色要求的军事能力和协作水平，就必须更有效地集中和共享它的资源。
Furthermore, whether on a bilateral basis, through NATO, or through the EU, France’s insistence on military sovereignty must be reconciled with Germany’s culture of excessive military restraint.	此外，不管是在双边基础上还是通过北约或欧盟，法国对军事主权的坚持必须与德国过度的军事克制协调���来。
Failure to share resources and coordinate policy would seriously undermine Europe’s security interests.	不能共享资源和协调政策将严重危害欧洲的安全利益。
The US rebalancing will also create an opportunity for Europe to play a greater role in an increasingly important region.	美国再平衡还为欧洲创造了在日渐重要地区扮演更大作用的机会。
By joining the US in the rebalancing process and supporting relations with China that are built on cooperation rather than containment, the EU would contribute to global stability, while spreading European values.	欧洲可以加入美国的再平衡过程，支持建立在合作而不是遏制基础上的对中国关系，以此有助于全球稳定，同时传播欧洲价值。
To this end, the EU can leverage its position as a leading trading partner, investor, and aid donor; it can also contribute at leaders’ summits, such as the Asia-Europe Meeting and the ASEAN Regional Forum.	在这方面，欧盟可以利用其领先贸易伙伴、投资者和援助出资者的地位；也可以通过领导人峰会起作用，比如亚欧峰会和东盟地区论坛。
The Obama administration seems to understand the potential benefits of such a “joint rebalancing,” with the EU-US statement on the Asia-Pacific region issued last July suggesting a move toward policy coordination.	奥巴马政府明白这一“联合再平衡”的潜在好处，去年7月欧盟-美国关于亚太地区的声明提出要迈向政策协作。
But, in pursuing such harmonization, Europeans should recognize that their Asia strategy – which has so far focused on commerce and, to a lesser degree, on the rule of law and human rights – will have to take on a security dimension.	但是，在追求融合的过程中，欧洲人应该认识到，他们的亚洲战略 — — 目前集中于商业，而对法治精神和人权的关注较少 — — 必须增加一个安全维度。
Indeed, if conflicts in Asia become more virulent, Europe cannot expect the US to shoulder the burden of maintaining regional stability alone.	事实上，如果亚洲冲突升级，欧洲不能期待美国独力承担维护地区稳定的责任。
While this does not necessarily imply a military role for Europe in Asia (although participation in peacekeeping missions should not be excluded), it does mean a more forceful diplomatic posture in support of mediation and multilateralism.	这并不一定意味着欧洲要在亚洲扮演军事角色（尽管参与维和任务的可能性不应该被排除 ） ， 但确实意味着欧洲应该采取更强硬的外交姿态支持调停和多边主义。
A joint rebalancing would help to fortify all facets of the EU-US relationship, possibly catalyzing progress on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.	联合再平衡将有利于增强欧盟-美国关系的各方面，并有望推进跨大西洋贸易和投资合作伙伴关系的前进。
It would also strengthen the largest economies’ rule-making capacity vis-à-vis the emerging economies, most notably China, in maintaining a liberal economic order.	这还可以加强两个最大经济体相对新兴经济体（特别是中国）在维持自由经济秩序方面的规则决定力。
In short, a common approach toward Asia would reinvigorate the transatlantic relationship at just the right time, and would guarantee that, despite having suffered from internal disagreements in the last decade, the EU-US partnership remains the cornerstone of a peaceful and prosperous world order.	简言之，一起偏向亚洲能够在正确的时间重振跨大西洋关系，并能够保证尽管过去十年内部分歧众多，但欧盟-美国伙伴关系仍是和平而繁荣的世界秩序的基石。
	
Why Fair Trade?	为何要有公平贸易？
LONDON – Historically, the term “fair trade” has meant many things.	发自伦敦 — — 在历史上 ， “ 公平贸易”这个词有着许许多多的含义。
The Fair Trade League was founded in Britain in 1881 to restrict imports from foreign countries.	公平贸易联盟于1881年在英国成立以限制来自外国进口商品。
In the United States, businesses and labor unions use “fair trade” laws to construct what economist Joseph Stiglitz calls “barbed-wire barriers to imports.”	在美国，商界以及工会都利用“公平贸易”法来构建经济学家约瑟夫•斯提格利茨（Joseph Stiglitz）所谓的“进口商品铁网屏障 ” 。
These so called “anti-dumping” laws allow a company that suspects a foreign rival of selling a product below cost to request that the government impose special tariffs to protect it from “unfair” competition.	一系列“反倾销”法允许那些怀疑国外对手以低于成本的价格销售商品的企业要求政府征收特别关税来保护其免遭“不公平”竞争的威胁。
Such dark protectionist thoughts are far from the minds of the benevolent organizers of the United Kingdom’s annual “Fairtrade Fortnight,” during which I just bought two bars of fair-trade chocolate and a jar of fair-trade chunky peanut butter.	当然，那些好心的英国年度“公平贸易双周”组织者们可没有这些阴暗的保护主义思想。 笔者也在活动中购买了两条公平贸易巧克力以及一罐公平贸易花生酱。
Their worthy aim is to raise the price paid to developing-country farmers for their produce by excluding the inflated profits of the middlemen on whom they depend for getting their goods to distant markets.	他们可敬的目标就是希望绕过那些将农产品销往远方赚取额外利润的中间人，向发展中国家农民支付更高的产品价格。
Fair-trade products like cocoa, coffee, tea, and bananas do not compete with domestic European production, and therefore do not have a protectionist motive.	类似可可、咖啡，茶叶和香蕉这样的公平贸易产品与欧洲本地产品并无竞争，因此也并不存在任何贸易保护主义动机。
This is how it works: In exchange for being paid a guaranteed price and meeting “agreed labor and environmental standards” (minimum wages, no pesticides), poor-country farming cooperatives receive a FAIRTRADE mark for their products, issued by the FAIRTRADE Labeling Organization.	整个规则是这样的：通过满足“约定的劳工以及环境标准（比如最低工资和不施农药 ） ” 并以保底价出售农产品，穷国的农业合作社可以从公平贸易标签发放机构获得一个公平贸易标签。
This certification enables supermarkets and other retailers to sell the products at a premium.	这一认证确保超级市场和其他零售商以额外溢价出售这些商品。
Third-world farmers get a boost to their income, while first-world consumers get to feel virtuous: a marriage made in heaven.	于是第三世界国家的农民获得了高收入，而第一世界的消费者们则自我感觉良好：简直是天作之合啊！
The fair-trade movement, launched in the 1980’s, has been growing rapidly.	发端于1980年代的公平贸易运动正在迅速发展。
In a notable breakthrough in 1997, the British House of Commons decided to serve only fair-trade coffee.	其中1997年的一次突破性进展则是英国下议院决定只提供公平贸易咖啡。
By the end of 2007, more than 600 producers’ organizations, representing 1.4 million farmers in 58 countries, were selling fair-trade products.	到2007年底为止已经有超过600个生产组织 — — 代表58个国家的140万农民 — — 在销售公平贸易产品。
Today, a quarter of all bananas in UK supermarkets are sold under a FAIRTRADE mark.	时至今日，全英超市中1/4的香蕉都拥有公平贸易标签。
But FAIRTRADE-labeled products still represent a very small share – typically less than 1% – of global sales of cocoa, tea, coffee, etc.	但这些贴着公平贸易标签的商品（可可，茶叶和咖啡等）依然只占全球市场的一小部分 — — 基本上少于1 % 。
The economic rationale for guaranteed prices is well known: stabilizing the prices of primary products, which are subject to sharp fluctuations, stabilizes their producers’ incomes.	设立保证收购价的经济逻辑众所周知：稳定这些基本产品的价格，避免出现大起大落，并因此稳定生产者的收入。
This argument inspired proposals – most famously by John Maynard Keynes in 1942 – to create “buffer stocks” for the main commodities, which would take supply off the market when prices fell, and add to supply when prices rose.	而这个引发众多争议的提议 — — 其中最著名的倡议者是约翰•凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes ） — —要求为初级商品建立一个“缓冲库存 ” ， 当价格下跌时吸纳产品，反之则增加供应量。
Keynes’s proposal never made it into the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944, and, while buffer-stock schemes re-surfaced in the 1970’s, they, too, went nowhere.	凯恩斯的提议最终没能被1944年的布雷顿森林体系采纳，而当缓冲库存方案在1970年代重新抬头之后也最终不了了之.
Left-wing economists like Raúl Prebisch, moreover, later advanced the theory of “declining terms of trade” for primary products: their prices’ long-run tendency to fall relative to the prices of manufactured goods.	此外，类似保罗•普雷维什（Raúl Prebisch）这样的左翼经济学家后来又进一步推广了初级商品的“贸易条件衰退”理论：这些产品的价格相对于制成品价格来说在长期趋势上是下跌的。
This tendency seemed to be at work from the mid-1980’s, as commodity producers experienced a persistent decline in prices.	这一趋势判断在1980年代中期开始似乎都适用，初级产品生产者都经历了价格的持续下跌。
In addition, price fluctuations throughout that decade were huge, with dire effects on sub-Saharan African and other developing countries that were largely dependent on commodities for export earnings.	此外，这段时期的价格波动极为剧烈，对撒哈拉以南非洲以及其他严重依赖初级产品来赚取外汇的发展中国家都造成了恶劣影响。
Since then, however, the price decline has been reversed.	但自那以后价格下跌的趋势却发生了逆转。
Food commodity prices have increased by 150% since 2001.	食品价格自2001年以来已经上涨了150 % 。
This has raised farm producers’ income independently of the fair-trade movement’s efforts.	这一状况也在排除公平贸易运动影响的情况下提升了农民的收入。
The “declining terms of trade” argument has collapsed.	“贸易条件衰退”理论也宣告破产。
But primary-product prices remain much more volatile than the prices of manufactured goods and services, causing large fluctuations in producers’ incomes.	但初级商品的价格依然比制成品和服务价格更加反复无常，导致生产者收入的极大波动。
This exaggerates the effects of booms and busts.	这也放大了兴衰周期的影响。
So the issue of price stabilization has not gone away.	因此价格稳定问题也依然存在。
It is difficult to see how the fair-trade movement can contribute much to solving this problem, because the only serious policy for stabilizing producers’ incomes is to control supply. But that is beyond the scope of fair trade.	目前依然无法得知公平贸易是否能为解决这个问题做出重大贡献，因为稳定生产者收入的唯一可靠方式就是控制供应，但这已经超出公平贸易的范畴之外了。
The target of all versions of fair trade is “free trade,” and the most damaging attacks on FAIRTRADE have come from free traders.	所有形式的公平贸易的目标就是“公平贸易 ” ， 而对公平贸易制度最有力的攻击则来自那些自由贸易者。
In Unfair Trade, a pamphlet published in 2008 by the Adam Smith Institute, Mark Sidwell argues that FAIRTRADE keeps uncompetitive farmers on the land, holding back diversification and mechanization.	在亚当•斯密研究所于2008年发布的一本名为《不公平贸易》的小册子中，马克•斯德维尔（Mark Sidwell）认为公平贸易制度保护了那些竞争力低下的农民，遏制了农产品多样化和机械化的推广。
According to Sidwell, the FAIRTRADE scheme turns developing countries into low-profit, labor-intensive agrarian ghettos, denying future generations the chance of a better life.	据斯德维尔所说，公平贸易方案将发展中国家转变成了低附加值劳动密集型的农业贫民区，剥夺了下一代人追求更优质生活的机会。
This is without considering the effect that FAIRTRADE has on the poorest people in these countries – not farmers but casual laborers – who are excluded from the scheme by its expensive regulations and labor standards.	这还没有考虑到公平贸易制度对那些国家中最贫穷的人民所带来的影响 — — 这些人连农民都不是，只能算是散工 — — 他们被公平贸易所设定的昂贵规章制度和劳工标准排斥在外。
In other words, FAIRTRADE protects farmers against their rivals and against agricultural laborers.	换句话说，公平贸易成为了农民对抗其他竞争者以及农业散工的保护伞。
Consumers, Sidwell argues, are also being duped.	斯德维尔还指出，消费者也遭到了愚弄。
Only a tiny proportion – as little as 1% – of the premium that we pay for a FAIRTRADE chocolate bar will ever make it to cocoa producers.	我们为一个公平贸易巧克力所支付的额外费用中只有极少比例 — — 1 % — —最终到了可可种植者手里。
Nor is FAIRTRADE necessarily a guarantee of quality: because producers get a minimum price for fair-trade goods, they sell the best of their crop on the open market.	此外公平贸易也不意味着优质：因为种植者可以以一个最低价来出售公平贸易产品，于是他们转而把最优质的产品拿到公开市场上销售。
But, despite its shaky economics, the fair-trade movement should not be despised.	但虽然在经济上站不住脚，公平贸易运动也不应遭到鄙视。
While cynics say that its only achievement is to make consumers feel better about their purchases – rather like buying indulgences in the old Catholic Church – this is to sell fair trade short.	即便批评者们说该运动的唯一成就就是让消费者们对自己感觉良好 — — 就像从前在天主教堂购买赎罪券那样，但这其实是低估了公平贸易。
In fact, the movement represents a spark of protest against mindless consumerism, grass-roots resistance against an impersonal logic, and an expression of communal activism.	事实上，这场运动代表了对愚蠢消费主义的某种抗议，对某些冷漠逻辑的草根反抗以及一种公共行动主义的表达方式。
That justification will not convince economists, who prefer a dryer sort of reasoning.	这一理由也许并不能说服那些喜欢枯燥推理的经济学家。
But it is not out of place to remind ourselves that economists and bureaucrats need not always have things their own way.	但这也提醒了我们：经济学家和政府官僚们不是永远都能按照自己的意愿行事的。
	
Is US Monetary Policy Made in China?	美国货币政策是中国制造吗？
AMSTERDAM – For much of the year, investors have been fixated on when the Fed will achieve “liftoff” – that is, when it will raise interest rates by 25 basis points, or 0.25%, as a first step toward normalizing monetary conditions.	阿姆斯特丹—在今年大部分时间里，投资者一直关注着美联储何时“升空 ” — —即何时将利率提高25个基点（或0.25 % ） ，作为迈向货币条件正常化的第一步。
Markets have soared and plummeted in response to small changes in Fed statements perceived as affecting the likelihood that liftoff is imminent.	市场因为美联储声明中的微小变化而波动，将这种措辞的变化视为即将“升空”的可能性的影响因素。
But, in seeking to gauge changes in US monetary conditions, investors have been looking in the wrong place.	但是，在寻找美国货币条件变化迹象方面，投资者们找错了目标。
Since mid-August, when Chinese policymakers startled the markets by devaluing the renminbi by 2%, China’s official intervention in foreign-exchange markets has continued, in order to prevent the currency from falling further.	自8月中旬以来，中国决策者让人民币贬值2 % ， 震惊了市场。 为了防止货币进一步贬值，中国官方外汇市场干预还在继续。
The Chinese authorities have been selling foreign securities, mainly United States Treasury bonds, and buying up renminbi.	中国当局一直在出售外汇储备（主要是美国国债 ） ， 买入人民币。
This is the opposite of what China did when the renminbi was strong.	这与中国在人民币强势期间的做法正好相反。
Back then, China bought US Treasury bonds to keep the currency from rising and eroding the competitiveness of Chinese exporters.	那时，中国买入美国国债，阻止人民币升值和影响其竞争力。
As a result, it accumulated an astounding $4 trillion of foreign reserves.	结果，中国积累了令人咋舌的4万亿美元外汇储备。
And what was true of China was also true of other emerging-market countries receiving capital inflows.	中国的情况也是其他得到资本流入的新兴市场国家的情况。
These countries’ foreign reserves, mainly held in US securities, topped $8 trillion at their peak last year.	这些国家的外汇储备（主要是美国债券 ） ， 在去年达到了8万亿美元以上的峰值。
The effects of these purchases attracted considerable attention.	这些买入美国国债的行为所造成的效果吸引了大量关注。
In 2005, US Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan pointed to the phenomenon as an explanation for his famous “conundrum”: interest rates on Treasury bonds were lower than market conditions appeared to warrant.	2005年，美联储主席艾伦·格林斯潘（Alan Greenspan）用这一现象解释他著名的“谜”论：美国国债利率比市场条件所隐含的水平还要低。
His successor, Ben Bernanke, similarly pointed to purchases of US debt by foreign central banks and governments as a reason why American interest rates were so low.	类似地，他的继任者本·伯南克（Ben Bernanke）也将外国央行购买国债描述为美国利率如此低的一个原因。
Now this process has gone into reverse.	如今，这一过程颠倒过来了。
Although no one outside official Chinese circles knows the exact magnitude of China’s foreign-exchange intervention, informed guesses suggest that it has been running at roughly $100 billion a month since mid-August.	尽管除了中国官方，其他人谁也不知道中国外汇干预的确切程度，但消息灵通人士猜测自8月中旬以来一直保持每个月1,000亿美元的规模。
Observers believe that roughly 60% of China’s liquid reserves are in US Treasury bills.	观察者认为，中国高流动性外汇储备中有60%是美国国债。
Given that reserve managers prefer to avoid unbalancing their carefully composed portfolios, they probably have been selling Treasuries at a rate of roughly $60 billion a month.	储备管理者更愿意避免让他们精心构筑的组合失衡，因此他们抛售美国国债的速度应该在每个月600亿美元。
The effects are analogous – but opposite – to those of quantitative easing.	其效果与量化宽松相当 — — 但方向相反。
Recall that the Fed began its third round of quantitative easing (QE3) by purchasing $40 billion of securities a month, before boosting the volume to $85 billion.	回忆一下，美联储开始其第三轮量化宽松（QE3）时，每个月买入证券量为400亿美元，后来增加到850亿美元。
Monthly sales of $60 billion by China’s government would lie squarely in the middle.	中国政府每月抛售600亿美元正好是其中间量。
Estimates of the effects of QE3 differ.	关于QE3效果的估计莫衷一是。
But the weight of the evidence is that QE3 had a modest but significant downward impact on Treasury yields and a positive effect on demand for riskier assets.	但大量证据表明，QE3对于美国国债收益率从存在温和但显著的抑制作用，对风险资产的需求存在积极影响。
Menzie Chinn of the University of Wisconsin has examined the impact of foreign purchases and sales of US government securities on ten-year Treasury yields.	威斯康辛大学的秦孟席（Menzie Chinn）估算了外国买卖美国政府债券对十年期国债收益率的影响。
His estimates imply that foreign sales at a rate of $60 billion per month raise yields by ten basis points.	他的估算表明，外国以每月600亿美元的速度抛售将让美国国债收益率升高10个基点。
Given that China has been at it for 2.5 months, this implies that the equivalent of a 25-basis-point increase in interest rates has already been injected into the market.	中国的抛售已经维持了2.5个月，因此其效果相当于市场利率已经提高了25个基点。
Some would object that the renminbi is weak because China is experiencing capital outflows by private investors, and that some of this private money also flows into US financial markets. This is technically correct, but it is already factored into the changes in interest rates described above.	有人会反对说，人民币疲软是因为中国遭遇私人投资者资本外流，其中一些私人资金还流入了美国金融市场。
Recall that capital also flowed out of the US when the Fed was engaged in QE, without vitiating the effects. That was what the earlier debate over “currency wars” – when emerging markets complained about being inundated by financial inflows from the US – was all about.	从技术上说，这是对的，但这一因素已经在上述利率变化中考虑到了。
Another objection is that QE operates not just through the so-called portfolio channel – by changing the mix of securities in the market – but also through the expectations channel.	另一个反对意见是量化宽松操作并不仅仅是通过所谓的投资组合渠道 — — 通过改变市场中的证券的组合 — — 进行的，也通过预期渠道进行。
It signals that the authorities are seriously committed to making the future different from the past.	这表明当局十分认真地想让未来不同于过去。
But if Chinese intervention is just a one-off event, and there are no expectations of it continuing, then this second channel shouldn’t be operative, and the impact will be smaller than that of QE.	但如果中国的干预只是暂时事件，无人预期会持续进行下去，那么第二渠道就没有操作性，其影响也将小于量化宽松。
The problem is that no one knows how long capital outflows from China will persist or how long the Chinese authorities will continue to intervene.	问题在于没人知道中国资本外流会持续多久，或中国当局会坚持干预多久。
From this standpoint, the Fed’s decision to wait to begin liftoff is eminently sensible.	从这一点看，美联储决定推迟升空非常明智。
And, given that China holds (and is therefore now selling) euros as well, the European Central Bank also should bear this in mind when it decides in December whether to ramp up its own program of quantitative easing.	此外，考虑到中国也持有（因此目前正在抛售）欧元，欧洲央行也应该在12月决定是否加码其本身的量化宽松计划是考虑到这一点。
	
Why Finance Can Save the Planet	为何金融能够拯救地球
PARIS – Most people hate finance, viewing it as the epitome of irresponsibility and greed.	巴黎—大部分人讨厌金融，把金融堪称不负责任和贪婪的同义词。
But, even after causing a once-in-a-century recession and unemployment for millions, finance looks indispensable for preventing an even worse catastrophe: climate change.	但是，即使金融引发了百年一遇的衰退和数百万人失业，但它仍是阻止更糟糕的灾难 — — 气候变化所不可或缺的工具。
Action is urgently needed to contain global warming and prevent a disaster for humanity; yet the global community is desperately short of tools.	急需采取行动遏制气候变暖、阻止人类灾难；但全球社会极度缺乏工具。
There is not much support for the most desirable solutions advocated by economists, such as a global cap on greenhouse-gas emissions, coupled with a trading system, or the enforcement of a worldwide carbon price through a global tax on CO2 emissions.	经济学家所宣扬的最合理的方案 — — 如全球温室气体排放限额和相关的交易制度，或通过全球二氧化碳排放税执行世界范围内的碳定价 — — 得不到多少支持。
Instead, negotiations for the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in December are being conducted on the basis of voluntary, unilateral pledges called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions.	相反，12月的巴黎联合国气候变化会议谈判基于被称之为各国自定贡献预案的自愿的单方面承诺。
Although the inclusion of voluntary targets has the merit of creating global momentum, this approach is unlikely to result in commitments that are both binding and commensurate to the challenge.	尽管纳入自愿目标有助于增加全球动力，但这一方针不可能产生具有约束力的、与挑战规模匹配的承诺。
That is why climate advocates are increasingly looking for other means of triggering action.	因此，气候支持者正在日益寻求其他方式促使人们采取行动。
Finance is at the top of their list.	金融在他们的工具清单上位居前茅。
For starters, finance provides an accurate yardstick to gauge if deeds are consistent with words.	首先，金融提供了衡量行动是否与言辞符合的准确准绳。
In 2011, “Unburnable Carbon,” a path-breaking report by the nongovernmental Carbon Tracker Initiative, showed that the proven fossil-fuel reserves owned by governments and private companies exceed by a factor of five the quantity of carbon that can be burned in the next 50 years if global warming is to be kept below two degrees Celsius.	2011年，非政府组织碳追踪计划（Carbon Tracker Initiative）发布了与一份突破性报告《不可燃碳 》 （ Unburnable Carbon ） ， 报告指出，政府和私人公司所拥有的已证实化石燃料储备是未来五十年将全球变暖幅度控制在二摄氏度以内所允许燃烧的碳量的五倍。
Reserves held just by the 200 top publicly listed fuel companies – thus excluding state-owned producers such as Saudi Arabia’s Aramco – exceed this carbon budget by one-third.	最大的200家上市燃料公司 — — 因此不包括沙特阿美石油（Aramco）等国有生产商 — — 所持有的储备就比这一碳预算多出三分之一。
And that means that these companies’ stock-market valuation is inconsistent with containing global warning.	这意味着这些公司的股市估值与遏制全球变暖不相符。
This realization prompted a campaign to convince investors to divest from carbon-rich assets.	这一现实激发了一场说服投资者撤回富碳资产投资的运动。
Individuals and institutions representing a $2.6 trillion portfolio have already joined the divestment movement.	个人和机构投资者加起来共有2.6万亿美元的投资组合加入了这场撤回投资运动。
Furthermore, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has highlighted the threat represented by potentially stranded carbon assets.	此外，英格兰银行行长卡尼（Mark Carney）强调了隐含碳资产所带来的风险。
Investors are being warned that, from the standpoint of financial stability, “brown” securities bear specific risk.	投资者被警告说，从金融稳定角度 ， “ 褐色”证券 （ ” brown” securities） 包含着特殊风险。
The amount of divestment may look big – and it is, particularly given that the campaign started recently.	撤回投资的规模看上去很大 — — 确实如此，特别是考虑到这场运动才刚刚开始。
Yet $2.6 trillion amounts to less than 5% of global private non-financial securities.	答案2.6万亿美元只占全球私有非金融证券总量的不到5 % 。
The trend is real, but it is still too little to trigger significant changes in fossil-fuel companies’ valuation and behavior.	趋势确实存在，但力度太小，不足以大幅改变化石燃料公司的估值和行为。
A second reason why finance matters is that the transition to a low-carbon economy requires huge investments.	金融很重要的第二个原因是向低碳经济的转型需要巨量投资。
According to the International Energy Agency, global investment in energy supply currently amounts to $1.6 trillion annually, and 70% of it is still based on oil, coal, or gas.	据国际能源署的数据，目前全球能源供给投资总量为每年1.6万亿美元，其中70%仍基于石油、煤炭或天然气。
Green investment amounts to only 15% of the total, and investment in energy efficiency – in buildings, transport, and industry – totals a meager $130 billion.	绿色投资只占总量的15 % ， 而能源效率投资 — — 建筑、交通和行业等 — — 总共还不到1,300亿美元。
Containing the increase in average surface temperature to two degrees requires developing clean technologies, and even more important, a four-fold increase in investment in energy efficiency over the next ten years.	将地表平均升温幅度控制在两度以内需要发展清洁技术，更重要的是，未来十年能源效率投资需要增加四倍。
Yet such investment will not be financed easily: its return depends on a still-elusive carbon price and will often materialize only in the long run, while improving energy efficiency implies replacing hundreds of millions of outdated vehicles and refitting hundreds of millions of energy-voracious buildings.	但这笔投资的融资绝不容易：投资回报取决于依然难以理解的碳定价，并且通常需要长期才能收回，而改进能源效率意味着淘汰数亿量陈旧车辆、修缮数亿栋耗能建筑。
Adequate financing instruments are required for the right purpose at the right place and at the right scale.	在正确的地方以正确的规模追求正确的目的需要充足的融资工具。
Development banks and green banks have a huge role to play.	开发银行和绿色银行可以起到巨大的作用。
For example, dedicated long-term loans, coupled with a tax break or a subsidy, would help households decide to modernize their homes.	比如，专用长期贷款与税收减免或补贴一道，有助于家庭对其房屋进行现代化改造。
But the real hope among climate specialists is that innovative finance could help provide the planning clarity that is currently missing.	但气候专家真正的希望是创新金融能有助于提供目前所不具备的计划明确性。
To elicit the investments that are necessary to mitigate climate change and green the economy, the elimination of fossil-fuel subsidies and a credible, fast-rising path for the price of carbon are vital.	为了引出减轻气候变化、绿化经济所必须的投资，至关重要的一点是取消化石燃料补贴并找到可靠、迅速的碳定价方法。
But, because high fuel prices are unpopular with consumers and raise competitiveness concerns among businesses, governments are reluctant to take action today – and may renege on their commitments to act tomorrow.	但是，由于高企的能源价格会引起消费者不满、引起企业关于竞争力的忧虑，政府不愿立刻采取行动 — — 而明天采取行动的承诺也有可能是一纸空文。
To overcome such trepidation, advocates for climate action are turning to incentives.	要克服这些忧虑，气候行动的支持者将目光投向了激励。
Some have recommended that governments issue CO2 performance bonds, whose yield would be reduced if companies exceed their carbon target.	一些人建议政府发行二氧化碳表现债券，这种债券的收益率将因为公司超过碳排目标而降低。
Another idea, put forward in a recent paper by Michel Aglietta and his colleagues, is to map out a path for an indicative price of carbon called its “social value” and provide green project developers a government-guaranteed carbon certificate representing the value of the corresponding emissions reduction.	米切尔·阿格列塔（Michel Aglietta）和他的同事在一篇最新文章中提出了另一个想法，即为碳制定一个参考定价，称之为碳的“社会价值 ” ， 并为绿色项目开发者颁发政府担保的、代表相应减排价值的碳证书。
Central banks, they suggest, would then refinance loans to such developers, up to the value of the carbon certificate.	他们建议，接着由中央银行对这些开发者提供再融资贷款，以碳证书的价值为限。
This would amount to a calculated bet.	这就构成了一个算计选择。
If the price of carbon in, say, ten years, actually corresponds to the announced social value, the project will be profitable and the developer will repay the loan.	如果十年后的碳定价果真与宣布的社会价值相符，这个项目就能盈利，开发者将偿还贷款。
But if the government reneges on its commitment, the developer will default, leaving the central bank with a claim on the government.	如果政府违背承诺，开发者将违约，中央银行获得对政府的索偿权。
Failure to increase the price of carbon would result either in higher public debt or, in the case of monetization, inflation.	不能提高碳定价要么导致公共债务负担增加，要么导致通货膨胀（如果货币化的话 ） 。
The idea is to force governments to have skin in the game, by balancing the risk of inaction on the carbon tax with the risk of insolvency or inflation.	这一想法的初衷是迫使政府通过权衡在碳税问题上不作为的风险和破产或通胀风险参与博弈。
There would be no procrastination.	这样不会有任何拖延。
Action against global warming would take place without delay.	遏制全球变暖的行动将毫不迟疑地开始。
But a decade or so later, governments – and societies more broadly – would need to choose between taxation, debt, and inflation.	但过十年左右，政府 — — 以及更广义的政府 — — 将需要在税收、债务和通胀之间做出选择。
Undertaking massive investment now and deciding only later how to finance it looks irresponsible – and so it is.	现在进行大量投资、日后在决定如何为投资融资看上去很不负责任 — — 确实如此。
But not acting at all would be even more irresponsible.	但一点都不行动更加不负责任。
	
Banking Reform’s Fear Factor	银行业改革的恐惧因素
WASHINGTON, DC – Nearly five years after the worst financial crisis since the 1930’s, and three years after the enactment of the Dodd-Frank financial reforms in the United States, one question is on everyone’s mind: Why have we made so little progress?	发自华盛顿特区 — — 20世纪30年代后最严重的经济危机过去五年后，也就是美国多德·弗兰克金融改革实施三年之后，有一个问题盘旋在每个人的心中:为什么过去几年我们几乎没什么进展?
New rules have been promised, but very few have actually been implemented.	政府承诺会出台新的规则，但实际上实施的却很少。
There is not yet a “Volcker Rule” (limiting proprietary trading by banks), the rules for derivatives are still a work-in-progress, and money-market funds remain unreformed. Even worse, our biggest banks have become even larger.	迄今仍没有“沃尔克法则 ” ( Volcker Rule，用以限制银行自营交易 ) ， 对衍生品的规定仍处于进展当中，货币市场基金仍未改革。
There is no sign that they have abandoned the incentive structure that encourages excessive risk-taking.	更糟糕的是，我们最大的银行变得更大了。
And the great distortions from being “too big to fail” loom large over many economies.	现在没有任何迹象表明银行放弃了那些鼓励过度冒险的激励机制。
There are three possible explanations for what has gone wrong.	对过去发生的问题有三种合理的解释。
One is that financial reform is inherently complicated.	一是金融改革本质上是复杂的。
But, though many technical details need to be fleshed out, some of the world’s smartest people work in the relevant regulatory agencies.	然而，虽然很多技术细节需要被具体化，我们有世界上最聪明的一群人正在相关的监管机构工作，所以这并不构成问题。
They are more than capable of writing and enforcing rules – that is, when this is what they are really asked to do.	他们不仅可以编写并实施法规 — — 也就是说，如果真的需要他们做得更多，他们也可以胜任。
The second explanation focuses on conflict among agencies with overlapping jurisdictions, both within and across countries.	第二种解释关注国家内及国家之间具有重叠权限的部门之间的矛盾。
Again, there is an element of truth to this; but we have also seen a great deal of coordination even on the most complex topics – such as how much equity big banks should have, or how the potential failure of such a firm should be handled.	再强调一次，这种观点有一定的道理; 但我们也看到了即使是在最复杂的问题上也有大量的协调 — — 比如大银行应该要有多少股本，或者应该怎样应对这样一所银行的破产可能性。
That leaves the final explanation: those in charge of financial reform really did not want to make rapid progress.	那么，这就只剩下了最后一种解释：那些负责金融改革的人并非真的想要取得迅速的进步。
In both the US and Europe, government leaders are gripped by one overriding fear: that their economies will slip back into recession – or worse.	在美国和欧洲，政府领导人都被一种压倒性的恐惧给抓住了：即害怕本国经济会退回经济衰退时期的水平 — — 甚至更糟。
The big banks play on this fear, arguing that financial reform will cause them to become unprofitable and make them unable to lend, or that there will be some other dire unintended consequence.	大银行则利用了他们的这种恐惧心理，提出金融改革会导致银行更加不能盈利并使得他们无法放贷，不然就是还有其它一些可怕的意外后果。
There has been a veritable avalanche of lobbying on this point, which has resulted in top officials moving slowly, for fear of damaging the economy.	对这一点进行游说已经构成了一个名副其实的雪崩效应，这导致了高层官员采取行动缓慢，因为他们害怕损害经济。
But this is a grave mistake – based on a failure to understand how big banks can damage the economy.	但这是一个重大的失误 — — 这个失误建立在无法理解大银行如何能破坏了经济的基础之上。
Higher equity-capital requirements, for example, require banks to fund themselves with relatively more equity and relatively less debt.	比如更高的股权资本要求，就需要银行用相对更多的股权和更少的债务来支持自己。
This makes them safer, because they are more able to absorb losses, and less likely to become zombie banks (which do not make sensible loans).	这让银行变得更加安全，因为它们更有能力承受损失，不那么可能变成僵尸银行(即那些不发放合理贷款的银行 ) 。
The banks claim that higher capital requirements and other regulations will drive up the cost of credit.	银行声称更高的资本要求和其它监管会抬高信贷成本。
But there is no sign of any such effect – a point made, rather belatedly, in the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy report to the US Congress last week.	但事实表明并没有这样的效应 — — 这是上周美联储给国会做的货币政策报告上一个姗姗来迟的观点。
On the contrary, the biggest US banks are reporting very healthy profits for the last quarter.	与银行所说相反，美国最大的银行对最后一个季度的报告却有着很可观的利润。
Unfortunately, a big part of these banks’ profits stems from trading securities – exactly the sort of high-risk activity that got them into trouble in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis.	不幸的是，这些银行的利润很大一部分来源于证券交易 — — 正是那种始于2008年的金融危机中让银行陷入麻烦的高风险活动。
These are highly leveraged businesses, typically funding their balance sheets with no more than 5% equity (and thus 95% debt).	这些都是高度杠杆化的交易活动，具有代表性的是银行仅仅用5%的股权(意味着95%的债务)来支撑它们的资产负债表。
To understand why this is a problem, consider what happens when you buy a house with just 5% down (or less than 3% down, which is a better analogy for some European banks).	要理解这为何会成为一个问题，想一想当你买一套房子时只付5 % ( 或少于3%的，这用来比喻一些欧洲银行更恰当)的首付会发生什么 。
If house prices go up, you make a good return on your equity (and a better return than if you had put 20% down).	如果房价上涨，那么相对你的投资资本就会有很好的回报(如果你的首付是20%那么回报会更高 ) 。
But if house prices go down, your equity may well be wiped out (which is what it means to be underwater on your mortgage).	但如果房价下跌，那么你的投资就相当于打了水漂(你的抵押贷款额也会高于实际房屋价格 ) 。
Higher equity-capital requirements for banks are good for the broader economy – they make financial crises (and the zombie-syndrome) less likely, less severe, or both.	要求银行要有更高的股本对大经济来说是有好处的 — — 这让金融危机(和停滞的经济状态)变得更不可能，不那么严重或者两者兼而有之。
US banks are currently funded with more equity than was the case before the financial crisis, and they are doing fine.	现在美国银行比金融危机爆发之前有更多的股本，它们的表现的确也良好。
Nonetheless, we should still worry about their ability to blow themselves up in a novel and creative fashion – hence the need for the Volcker Rule, derivatives reform, and new rules for money-market funds.	然而，我们仍然要担心银行可能会以一种异常且新颖的方式来毁掉自己 — — 因此我们需要沃尔克法则，对衍生产品进行改革并对货币市场基金实施新的规则。
And equity-capital requirements for large, systemically important financial institutions remain too low.	而当前对大型具有系统重要性的金融机构的股本要求仍然很低。
The latest indications are that US policymakers are finally starting to focus on this point.	最新的情况显示是美国政策制定者最终开始关注这一点。
Many European banks, however, have less equity than their US counterparts, which creates an important source of vulnerability going forward.	然而，很多欧洲银行跟它们的美国同行相比，持有更少的股本，这就成了其将来弱点的主要来源。
If there is to be a broad-based European recovery, the banks must raise more equity, thereby strengthening their ability to absorb potential losses.	如果说将来会有基础深厚的欧洲经济复苏，银行就必须提高其股本持有数量，从而加强它们承受潜在损失的能力。
Unfortunately, there is little sign that European policymakers understand this point.	不幸地是，几乎没有迹象表明欧洲政策制定者理明白这一点。
Instead, senior officials in Europe think and talk like US policymakers did three years ago.	相反，欧洲的高级官员的思维和言论跟他们美国同行三年前一样。
They are wary of rocking the financial boat, so they go easy on financial reform and refuse to insist on more equity capital for banks.	他们太害怕搞翻了金融这条船，所以他们温和地对待金融改革并拒绝坚持要求银行持有更多的股本。
This is a mistake that they – and possibly all of us – may come to regret.	这是一个错误，他们 — — 很有可能我们全部人 — — 将来都会后悔。
	
Models Behaving Badly	表现不佳的模型
LONDON – “Why did no one see the crisis coming?”	发自伦敦 — — “为何没人预料到危机降临 ？ ”
Queen Elizabeth II asked economists during a visit to the London School of Economics at the end of 2008.	2008年底，英女王伊丽莎白二世到访伦敦经济学院时曾向经济学家们提出这样一个问题。
Four years later, the repeated failure of economic forecasters to predict the depth and duration of the slump would have elicited a similar question from the queen: Why the overestimate of recovery?	时隔四年，经济预测者在衰退深度以及持续时间上的持续失准又让人们不禁跟女王一样发问：为何会高估了经济复苏？
Consider the facts. In its 2011 forecast, the International Monetary Fund predicted that the European economy would grow by 2.1% in 2012.	请参考以下事实：2011年，国际货币基金组织预测欧洲经济将在2012年实现2.1%的增长。
In fact, it looks certain to shrink this year by 0.2%.	但事实上，今年欧洲经济萎缩0.2%似乎已成定局。
In the United Kingdom, the 2010 forecast of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) projected 2.6% growth in 2011 and 2.8% growth in 2012; in fact, the UK economy grew by 0.9% in 2011 and will flat-line in 2012.	在英国，其预算责任办公室于2010年预测2011年经济会增长2.6 % ， 而2012年会增长2.8 % ； 而实际上英国经济在2011年只增长了0.9%而2012年将停滞不前。
The OECD’s latest forecast for eurozone GDP in 2012 is 2.3% lower than its projection in 2010.	此外世界经济合作与发展组织对欧元区2012年GDP的最新预测也比其2010的推测要低2.3 % 。
Likewise, the IMF now predicts that the European economy will be 7.8% smaller in 2015 than it thought just two years ago.	同样地，国际货币基金组织当前预测的2015年欧洲经济规模将比两年预测要小7.8 % 。
Some forecasters are more pessimistic than others (the OBR has a particularly sunny disposition), but no one, it seems, has been pessimistic enough.	其中一些预测者要比另外一些更为悲观（相比之下英国预算责任办公室算是尤其乐观的 ） ， 但似乎没有人能悲观到足够接近真相的程度。
Economic forecasting is necessarily imprecise: too many things happen for forecasters to be able to foresee all of them.	经济预测必然是不精确的：即将发生的事情如此之多，以致经济预测者们根本无法全部预见。
So judgment calls and best guesses are an inevitable part of “scientific” economic forecasts.	所以判断估计和最佳猜测就成为了“科学的”经济预测中不可分割的一部分。
But imprecision is one thing; the systematic overestimate of the economic recovery in Europe is quite another.	然而不精确是一回事；对欧洲经济复苏作出系统性高估又是另一回事。
Indeed, the figures have been repeatedly revised, even over quite short periods of time, casting strong doubt on the validity of the economic models being used.	事实上，数据一直被反复修改，有时甚至是在很短的时间内被修改，这就使人们不得不怀疑经济预测者们手中经济模型的有效性。
These models, and the institutions using them, rely on a built-in theory of the economy, which enables them to “assume” certain relationships.	这些模型以及其使用机构都依赖于经济中的固有理论，该理论使得他们能够“假定”某些事物之间的关联。
It is among these assumptions that the source of the errors must lie.	而错误的来源必然存在于这些设想之中。
Two key mistakes stand out.	其中有两个非常突出的关键错误。
The models used by all of the forecasting organizations dramatically underestimated the fiscal multiplier: the impact of changes in government spending on output.	各大预测机构所使用的模型都显著低估了财政乘数：政府支出变化对产出的影响。
Second, they overestimated the extent to which quantitative easing (QE) by the monetary authorities – that is, printing money – could counterbalance fiscal tightening.	第二，他们高估了金融当局实施的量化宽松政策 — — 也就是印钞票 — — 对财政紧缩的抵消程度。
Until recently, the OBR, broadly in line with the IMF, assumed a fiscal multiplier of 0.6: for every dollar cut from government spending, the economy would shrink by only 60 cents.	直到最近，预算责任办公室 — — 大致与国际货币基金组织一样 — — 都依然采用0.6的财政乘数：也就是政府每减少一美元的支出，经济只会收缩60美分。
This assumes “Ricardian equivalence”: debt-financed public spending at least partly crowds out private spending through its impact on expectations and confidence.	这就假定了“李嘉图等价定理 ” ： 举债融资的公共支出通过对预期和信心的影响至少会在某种程度上挤压私人消费。
If households and firms anticipate a tax increase in the future as a result of government borrowing today, they will reduce their consumption and investment accordingly.	如果家庭和公司预期到由于政府借款而导致未来增税的话，他们就将减少相应的消费和投资。
On this view, if fiscal austerity relieves households of the burden of future tax increases, they will increase their spending.	从这一观点来看，如果财政紧缩能减轻未来增税给家庭带来的负担，后者就将增加支出。
This may be true when the economy is operating at full employment – when state and market are in competition for every last resource.	这点或许在经济充分运行时是真实的 — — 当政府和市场都在争夺每一份资源时。
But when there is spare capacity in the economy, the resources “freed up” by public-sector retrenchment may simply be wasted.	但当经济体中出现富余产能时，由公共部门紧缩释放的资源就可能只会被浪费掉。
Forecasting organizations are finally admitting that they underestimated the fiscal multiplier.	预测机构最终承认他们低估了财政乘数。
The OBR, reviewing its recent mistakes, accepted that “the average [fiscal] multiplier over the two years would have needed to be 1.3 – more than double our estimate – to fully explain the weak level of GDP in 2011-12.”	预算责任办公室回顾了其近期的错误，承认“这两年的平均财政乘数应该是1.3 — — 比我们原来预测的两倍还要多 — — 这才能解释2011到2012年GDP的疲弱水平 。 ”
The IMF has conceded that “multipliers have actually been in the 0.9 and 1.7 range since the Great Recession.”	国际货币基金组织已经承认“自从大萧条以来财政乘数实际上已经处于0.9到1.7之间的水平 。 ”
The effect of underestimating the fiscal multiplier has been systematic misjudgment of the damage that “fiscal consolidation” does to the economy.	对财政乘数的低估已经导致了“财政巩固”对经济影响的系统性判断失误。
This leads us to the second mistake.	而这又导致我们犯下了第二个错误。
Forecasters assumed that monetary expansion would provide an effective antidote to fiscal contraction.	预测者假定货币扩张会有效地消除财政紧缩。
The Bank of England hoped that by printing £375 billion of new money, ($600 billion), it would stimulate total spending to the tune of £50 billion, or 3% of GDP.	英格兰银行过去希望通过加印3750亿英镑新钞（约合6000亿美元）可以刺激共计500亿英镑的支出（或等于3%的GDP ） 。
But the evidence emerging from successive rounds of QE in the UK and the US suggests that while it did lower bond yields, the extra money was largely retained within the banking system, and never reached the real economy.	然而在英美两国先后几轮量化宽松政策中展现出的事实表明虽然债券收益确实有所降低，但额外加印的货币很大程度上还滞留在银行系统，从未流入实体经济。
This implies that the problem has mainly been a lack of demand for credit – reluctance on the part of businesses and households to borrow on almost any terms in a flat market.	这意味着问题主要是缺乏信贷需求 — — 在这个萧条的市场，无论条件有多优惠，企业和家庭都不愿向银行贷款。
These two mistakes compounded each other: If the negative impact of austerity on economic growth is greater than was originally assumed, and the positive impact of quantitative easing is weaker, then the policy mix favored by practically all European governments has been hugely wrong.	这两种错误相互作用：如果紧缩对经济增长的负面影响比原先估计的要大，而量化宽松政策的积极影响比估计的要弱，那么几乎所有欧洲政府偏爱的政策组合就是一个巨大的错误。
There is much greater scope for fiscal stimulus to boost growth, and much smaller scope for monetary stimulus.	财政刺激促进经济增长的余地很大，而货币刺激就没那么有用。
This is all quite technical, but it matters a great deal for the welfare of populations.	这一切基本上都是些技术问题，但它在很大程度上影响着人们的福祉。
All of these models assume outcomes on the basis of existing policies.	所有的经济模型都在现行政策的基础上假定产出。
Their consistent over-optimism about these policies’ impact on economic growth validates pursuing them, and enables governments to claim that their remedies are “working,” when they clearly are not.	他们一直过于乐观地看待这些政策对经济增长的影响，因此为追求这些政策提供了正当性，并使政府能够声称自身的挽救经济措施正在“起作用 ” ， 但事实上却没有。
This is a cruel deception.	这是一个残忍的骗局。
Before they can do any good, the forecasters must go back to the drawing board, and ask themselves whether the theories of the economy underpinning their models are the right ones.	在这些预测者们起到任何作用之前，他们应该回到图表板前，抚心自问那些支撑他们模型的经济理论究竟是不是对的。
	
Hollande in Mali	奥朗德在马里
PARIS – While hundreds of thousands demonstrated in Paris against the right of homosexual couples to marry and adopt children, French troops were arriving in Mali to stop a coalition of Islamist and rebel forces from taking control of its capital, Bamako, and creating in the Sahel a sanctuary for terrorists.	巴黎—在数十万人在巴黎街头反对同性恋结婚和养育孩子的权利的同时，法军正在开赴马里，阻止伊斯兰武装和叛军组成的联军控制其首都巴马科，让萨赫勒草原成为恐怖分子的避难所。
These are trying times for French President François Hollande.	这些都是对法国总统奥朗德的试金石。
Besieged economically at home, where his popularity is at its lowest since his election last year, can he regain credibility, if not support, as supreme commander of French forces?	在国内，奥朗德饱受经济问题困扰，其支持度已降至去年当选以来最低。 在这样的情况下，他能从新赢得作为法军最高指挥官的信誉（姑且不论支持）吗？
Once upon a time, “I intervene, therefore I am” might as well have been a French motto, particularly in Africa.	曾几何时 ， “ 我与故我在”称得上是法国的座右铭，特别是在非洲。
But, while French national identity is intimately bound up with France’s international standing – how it is perceived in the world – enthusiasm for intervention has receded.	但是，尽管法兰西的民族认同与法国的国际地位 — — 即它在世界人民心目中的形象 — — 息息相关，干预的热情却在减退。
The benefits have become more dubious, while the costs and risks have grown increasingly evident.	干预的好处越来越受到质疑，而成本和风险越来越表露无遗。
If France has again become a regional gendarme by default, it is largely for three reasons.	如果法国自动重新成为地区警察，那么主要是出于三方面原因。
American enthusiasm for intervention in Africa has greatly diminished since the operation in Somalia in 1992-1993 – and more globally following the long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.	自1992—1993年的索马里以来，特别是在伊拉克和阿富汗打了两场旷日持久的战争之后，美国干预非洲的热情有所消退。
European interest in military intervention in Africa is as low as ever.	欧洲干预非洲的军事利益前所未有地低。
And, as for the region’s governments, it would be an understatement to say that they are not yet ready militarily to take their fate into their own hands.	此外，对该地区的政府来而言，说它们还不具备独立掌握命运的军事实力是站不住脚的。
While France is not alone – manifestations of support have come from its Western and African partners, as well as from the Middle East – it will bear the primary responsibility and the risks.	尽管法国并不孤独 — — 其西方和非洲甚至中东盟国纷纷表示支持 — — 但它将承担主要责任和风险。
For Islamic fundamentalists, France is now the “Great Satan.”	对伊斯兰原教旨主义者来说，法国现在是“大恶魔 。 ”
Indeed, the conflict in Mali is taking place geographically in Africa, but in many ways its causes and ramifications lie in the Middle East.	事实上，马里冲突虽然从地理上说发生在非洲，但从很多方面看，其根源和演化都是中东式的。
When France intervened in an African country in the past, there was no risk of terrorist attacks on its territory or on its citizens elsewhere in the world.	过去，法国在干预非洲国家时不会在当地或在世界其他地区遭到该国人策划的恐怖袭击。
That is no longer the case.	现在则非如此。
It is too early to say what will happen in Mali or the Sahel – or, for that matter, in France itself.	现在判断马里和萨赫勒 — — 或者就这个问题而言，在法国本土 — — 将发生什么还为时过早。
For the moment, the French are standing, overwhelmingly, behind Hollande.	现在，法国人一边倒地支持者奥朗德。
They would have criticized him had he remained passive while Bamako fell into the hands of terrorists.	若巴马科落入恐怖分子之手，则奥朗德将被千夫所指。
Yet this support may be fragile, and could collapse if something goes wrong on the ground – or, worse, in France.	但这一支持是脆弱的，如果形势转坏（特别是在法国国内 ） ， 奥朗德的支持就会轰然瓦解。
Before the intervention, Mali was not a French priority.	在出兵干预之前，马里并非法国日程上的重点。
Rising unemployment at home seemed to be a more urgent task than did addressing instability in Africa.	国内的失业上升之势是比解决非洲不稳定问题更紧迫的任务。
While the French public agrees that Mali cannot be allowed to become a haven for terrorists, the way Afghanistan did in the late 1990’s, attitudes toward intervention have evolved in recent decades.	尽管法国公众都同意不能让马里如同20世纪90年代末的阿富汗那样沦为恐怖分子的避风港，但关于干预的态度，几十年来发生了很大改变。
In the early 1980’s, after a particularly bloody terrorist attack on French and American forces in Lebanon, France’s tolerance for military casualties seemed much higher than that of the United States.	20世纪80年代初，黎巴嫩发生了针对法军和美军的严重流血恐怖袭击，此后法国对军事伤亡的厌恶程度便远远胜过了美国。
But this has changed.	但这已经发生了改变。
The French now find themselves on the front line at a time when they have much less appetite for it.	如今，在法国人对军事伤亡容忍度大大降低的时候，法国又站在了干预的前沿。
Moreover, budget restrictions have severely constrained French military capabilities.	此外，预算限制严重约束着法国的军事实力。
French and British military intervention was successful in Libya in 2011 at least in part as a result of US military procurement.	法国和英国之所以能够在2011年对利比亚成功实施军事干预，部分原因是因为有美国的军事采购支持。
Of course, from a French perspective, the US role is somewhat ironic.	当然，从法国角度看，美国的角色颇有些讽刺意味。
In the years after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Americans always had to be on the front line – battling the enemy abroad to avoid having to battle him at home, in the parlance of the time – while the European allies were perceived as the cleaning staff.	2001年9月11日恐怖袭击发生后的几年中，美国一直站在冲突前沿 — — 用当时的话说，就是在国外与敌人战斗以保本土安全 — — 而其欧洲盟国给人的感觉是清道夫。
But imperial fatigue after Iraq and Afghanistan has left its imprint.	但在伊拉克和阿富汗之后，美国疲态尽露。
Americans are starting to enjoy – probably too much for their allies – what President Barack Obama, describing the US role in Libya, called “leading from behind.”	美国人开始乐于接受总统奥巴马用来描述美国在利比亚扮演所边沿角色的话，即“从幕后领导 ” ， 或许对于其盟国而言，美国退得太多了。
For Hollande, war in Mali is both an opportunity and a risk.	对奥朗德来说，在马里开展既是机会，也是风险。
If Nicolas Sarkozy, whom he defeated, was widely regarded as “too” presidential, Hollande has given the impression of not being presidential “enough.”	如果被他击败的萨科齐被广泛认为“太”总统了，那么奥朗德给人的印象是“不够”总统。
His fall from public grace – too statist and fiscally intrusive for the right, but too moderate and social democratic for the true left – was more rapid than that of any president of the Fifth Republic.	作为第五共和国总统，奥朗德公众支持度下降之快首屈一指 — — 对右翼来说，他太执着于统计数字，在财政上太过激进；对于真正的左翼来说，他又太温和，太过于社会民主。
Of course, with unemployment rising every month, it is difficult to remain popular for long.	当然，随着失业率逐月升高，���保持公众支持是很困难的。
As the supreme commander of an army at war, Hollande can now try to reinvent himself.	作为战斗军队的最高指挥官，奥朗德现在可以重新树立自己的形象。
But, successive presidents since Jacques Chirac have failed to reconcile the French with politics.	但是，希拉克之后的法国总统都没有办法实现法国政坛的和谐。
France’s citizens have tended to expect too much from their state, and now they may be expecting too little from politics and politicians at a time when deep divisions on fundamental economic and social issues run not only between the traditional right and left, but also within both camps.	法国人民对国家期待太大，而如今，在基本经济和社会问题的深刻分歧不仅来自传统的左翼和右翼，也来自左右阵营内部的时候，他们对政治和政客的期待又太少。
Will foreign intervention reunite the French?	对外干预会让法国重新团结起来吗？
Will war in Africa be the defining moment of Hollande’s presidency?	在非洲作战会成为奥朗德总统生涯的转折点吗？
Will he be remembered as the French Harry Truman – a discreet, uncharismatic man who, when faced with urgent and dramatic circumstances, ended up doing the right things for lack of a better alternative?	奥朗德会因为成为法国的杜鲁门 — — 一个谨小慎微、毫无魅力可言，但在面临重大紧迫事务时在没有更佳方案时作出正确选择的人 — — 而被人铭记吗？
This is a portentous moment both for Mali and for security in the Sahel and Europe.	这是一个不详的时刻，不管对马里还是对萨赫勒和欧洲安全来说都是如此。
It is no less significant for Hollande and France.	对奥朗德和法国来说，这一时刻的意义也不可小觑。
	
France Alone?	孤独的法国？
PARIS – In less than two years, France has carried out three decisive foreign military interventions.	巴黎—在不到两年的时间里，法国做出了三次果断的出兵干预决策。
In March 2011, its airstrikes in Libya (alongside those of Great Britain) thwarted Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi’s troops as they prepared to retake the city of Benghazi.	2011年3月，法国（联合英国）对利比亚的空袭挫败了卡扎菲上校准备收复班加西的图谋。
A month later, French forces in Côte d’Ivoire arrested President Laurent Gbagbo, who had refused to recognize his rival’s election victory, putting the country at risk of civil war.	一个月后，法军在科特迪瓦捉拿拒绝承认对手赢得大选的总统巴博，消灭了内战之忧。
Now France has intervened in Mali.	如今，法国又出兵干预马里。
The latest intervention was initially planned as part of a European mission to support African forces, but France abruptly decided to act unilaterally to blunt the advance of Islamists who threatened to overrun Mopti, the last barrier before reaching the capital, Bamako.	这次最新的干预最初是作为欧洲支持非洲军队计划的一部分，但法国突然决定单方面行动，以挫败伊斯兰武装突破首都巴马科的最后屏障 — — 莫普提的图谋。
Beyond that objective, France seeks to protect its many nationals in the region; maintain stability in the Sahel, where states are very weak; and prevent Mali’s transformation into a base of Islamist terrorism directed at Europe.	除了这一目标，法国还想保护在该地区的众多侨民、维持萨赫勒的稳定（那里的国家大多非常孱弱）并阻止马里沦为伊斯兰恐怖主义向欧洲发动攻击的基地。
A lot is at stake – all the more so because French intervention is likely to be extensive.	兹事体大 — — 甚至会进一步加大，因为法国的干预程度可能会加深。
While the Islamists have been temporarily defeated, they are well armed and receive supplies from Libya via Algeria, which has suppressed Islamists at home but seems to turn a blind eye to their transit through its territory.	尽管伊斯兰武装暂时被击败了，但他们装备精良，并有利比亚通过阿尔及利亚予以供给上的支持。 阿尔及利亚在国内镇压伊斯兰武装，但对于取道其国土的转运则是睁只眼闭只眼。
Moreover, the capabilities of the Malian army and those of other West African countries that are supposed to join the operation are too weak to turn the tide.	此外，马里和其他准备加入行动的西非国家军队实力太弱，不足以成事。
The United States tried to train the Malian army, but failed miserably.	美国尝试训练马里军队，但惨遭失败。
So, with the security of Europe as a whole at stake, why is France the only country involved?	那么，既然整个欧洲的安全都系于马里，为何只有法国参与其中？
One explanation is to view the intervention as a neo-colonial bid to protect a French preserve.	一个解释是此次干预是新殖民主义，为的是保护法国领地。
This is a profound error.	这一说法大错特错。
France has no interest in protecting a Malian regime that it knows to be corrupt and incompetent; indeed, France recently refused to support a request from President François Bozizé’s regime in the neighboring Central African Republic for aid in dealing with rebels.	保护马里政权绝不符合法国的利益，其腐败和无能早已众人皆知；事实上，最近法国拒绝了邻国中非共和国总统博齐泽（François Bozizé）派兵打击叛军的要求。
France’s motivations are broader.	法国的着眼点更加宏大。
In particular, France has always considered Sub-Saharan Africa and the Arab world to be natural spheres of political and strategic influence that are necessary to maintaining its position as a global power.	特别是，法国向来将撒哈拉以南非洲和阿拉伯世界视为维持其全球强国地位不可或缺的天然政治和战略影响范围。
The second explanation is more credible: France, aside from Great Britain, is Europe’s only true military power.	第二个解释更加可信一些：除了英国以外，法国是欧洲唯一的真正军事强国。
It believes that operational military capability is a condition of power – a view that is not shared by the overwhelming majority of European states, which continue to display a collective aversion to war.	法国相信，展现胜任的军力是实力的表现 — — 对于这一看法，绝大部分欧洲国家都是不认同的，它们对战争持有集体厌恶。
To be sure, Europe has the means for joint action.	平心而论，欧洲具有采取联合行动的方法。
In 2003, following the start of the Iraq war, Europe embraced a strategy prepared by Javier Solana, then the European Union’s High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy.	2003年，伊拉克���争爆发后，欧洲采取了时任欧盟共同外交和安全政策高级代表索拉纳（Javier Solana）所提出的战略。
But, while a large number of Europeans naively believed that this was the prelude to a joint European strategy, the proposal was drafted in terms that were so vague as to allow any outcome – or none.	但是，尽管众多欧洲人天真地认为欧洲联合战略只是个序幕，但这一方案非常模糊，根本无法形成成果。
The EU’s Lisbon Treaty mentions “permanent structured cooperation” in security and defense policy, and an entire institutional apparatus of political and military committees exists to anticipate, prepare for, and implement military operations at the European level.	欧盟里斯本条约提到在安全和防务政策上实行“永久的结构性合作 ” ， 并设立了政治和军事委员会作为完整的制度性机构处理欧洲层面的预测、准备和实施军事行动事宜。
But this mechanism lacks the common political will needed to activate it; the less it is used, the less usable it will become.	但这一机制缺乏激活它所需要的共同政治意愿；而这一机制使用得越少，其可用性就越低。
During the Libyan crisis, Solana’s successor, Catherine Ashton, deliberately sought to limit the EU’s role to that of a super-NGO focused on humanitarian aid and economic development.	在利比亚危机期间，索拉纳的继任者阿什顿（Catherine Ashton）有意地将欧盟的角色限定在专注于人道主义援助和经济开发的超级非政府组织的范围内。
Recently, during the vote on Palestinian representation at the United Nations, the EU called for its members to abstain – an odd way to affirm Europe’s commitment to global leadership.	最近，在巴勒斯坦地位的联合国投票中，欧盟号召成员国弃权 — — 对于欧洲谋求全球领导权的目标来说，这一做法令人费解。
For Great Britain, Europe-wide defense is a nonstarter.	对英国来说，泛欧洲防务根本毫无意义。
Britain has deviated from this principle only once, when it agreed to participate in the Atalanta anti-piracy operation off the Horn of Africa – probably because it was placed in command.	对于这一原则，英国只偏离过一次，即同意加入非洲之角亚特兰特（Atlante）反海盗行动，这或许是因为它能占据行动指挥的地位。
As a result, those who want a common European defense capability lack the means to create it, while those who have the means to create it do not want it (with the possible exception of France).	于是，希望形成共同欧洲防务能力者缺少实施办法，而手握实施办法者又不愿实施（法国也许是个例外 ） 。
Britain’s bilateral cooperation with France – highlighted during the Libyan crisis – is sometimes very strong.	有时，英国会与法国实施强大的联合行动 — — 利比亚危机期间便是明证。
But, despite the two countries’ 2010 treaty on defense and security cooperation, the British have decided, for budgetary reasons, to acquire aircraft that will not be compatible with French aircraft carriers.	但是，尽管两国在2010年签订了防务和安全合作条约，英国人仍借口预算问题采购与法国航母不兼容的战斗机。
Even Spain and Italy, the two countries most affected by developments in the Mediterranean and the Sahel, have reduced their military expenditures significantly.	就连受地中海和萨赫勒形势最大的两个国家 — — 西班牙和意大利里都大幅削减了军事支出。
Unlike Germany, both participated in the Libyan intervention, but with highly limiting rules of engagement for their forces.	和德国不同，这两个国家都参与了利比亚干预，但军队介入的程度均非常浅。
For example, Italian naval forces were instructed to avoid the waters off the coast of Tripoli, and Spanish tanker aircraft were forbidden to refuel fighter jets.	比如，意大利海军接到的命令是防止海水倒灌的黎波里海岸，西班牙空中加油机则被禁止为战斗机加油。
Europe as a whole currently devotes only 1.6% of its GDP to defense, compared to 4.8% for the US.	欧洲作为一个整体，其防务支出只有GDP的1.6 % ， 而美国是4.8 % 。
It is the only world region where military expenditures are decreasing.	它也是世界上唯一一个军事支出下降的地区。
Its deployed forces are extremely small, accounting for 4% of all military personnel worldwide, versus 14% for the US.	其军队部署规模极小，只占世界军队总规模的4 % ， 而美国是14 % 。
Industrial cooperation, which could constitute an economic and military asset, is also weakening, as demonstrated by Germany’s successful opposition to the proposed EADS/BAE merger, which was officially canceled in October.	能形成经济和军事资产的产业合作也在弱化，德国成功地反对了EADS/BAE合并计划便是明证，10月，该计划被正式取消。
Germany had seemed to embark on a more robust policy since its participation in military operations in Afghanistan.	自参与阿富汗军事行动后，德国似乎打定主意要采取更稳健的政策。
Now, however, it recoils at any prospect of military intervention, even as it remains the world’s third-largest arms exporter.	但是，如今它在所有军事干预意向之前全面退缩，尽管它仍是世界第三大军备出口国。
Europe is reluctant to develop a substantial military force, because the European project was created in opposition to the idea of power.	欧洲无意发展庞大的军队，因为欧洲工程的基础思想反对实力为王。
Yet this stance has become untenable.	但这一立场已越来越站不住脚。
Europe faces real threats, which France alone cannot contain.	欧洲面临着实实在在的威胁，光靠法国是无法解决的。
Moreover, the international system is increasingly coalescing around national powers that consider military force to be an essential prerequisite of influence.	此外，国际体系正在让认为军事实力是影响力的先决条件的国家联合起来。
Europe does not face a choice between soft and hard power.	欧洲面临的不是软实力还是硬实力的选择。
It must combine both if it is to survive.	欧洲必须将两者联合起来才能生存。
	
The French Disconnection	法国的单飞
PARIS – Dire conditions can permit what was once unthinkable to push its way into public debate.	发自巴黎 — — 极端的情况可以让原本不可想象的事情变成公众议题。
In France, the idea that now dares to speak its name is that the country will sink into an ever-deeper economic malaise unless it regains its monetary sovereignty.	而在法国，一个大胆出格的说法就是除非恢复其货币主权，否则就将陷入比以往任何时候都更深层次的经济萎缩之中。
Two striking statements on economic policy by France’s leaders in the first weeks of this year have highlighted the force of this logic.	法国领导人在今年最初的那几周里发表的两个引人注目的经济政策声明突显了上述逻辑的力量。
First, President François Hollande, worried about the euro’s appreciation against other major world currencies, called for an exchange-rate target.	首先，总统弗朗索瓦·奥朗德（François Hollande）担心欧元会对其他世界主要货币升值，并呼吁设定汇率目标。
Then, Pierre Moscovici, the finance minister, said that Europe might grant France a delay in meeting the 3%-of-GDP budget-deficit target mandated from this year onward under the eurozone’s newly ratified fiscal compact.	然后财政部长皮埃尔·莫斯科维奇（Pierre Moscovici）说虽然欧元区最近通过的财政契约规定从今年开始各国预算赤字都不得超过GDP的 3 % ， 但欧洲也许会允许法国推迟兑现这一目标。
These positions imply a desire to exercise sovereign power over the Economic and Monetary Union’s rules and decisions.	这些声明意味着法国有意对经济与货币联盟的规则和决策行使主权权力。
Back in 1989-1991, exactly the same motive underlay President François Mitterrand’s imposition of the euro on Germany – that is, to harness the Bundesbank’s monetary power to a framework in which France could be confident of wielding decisive influence.	回顾1989~1991年间，时任法国总统的弗朗索·密特朗（François Mitterrand）基于同样的动机强行向德国推销欧元 — — 就是要用法国有信心发挥起决定性影响的框架来束缚住德国央行的货币实力。
Since the single currency was France’s condition for accepting German reunification, Germany played along.	由于单一货币是当年法国接受德国统一的条件，德国只好照办。
Two decades later, Germany may be in a different mood.	时隔二十年后，德国人的想法可能已经不一样了。
The sovereign-debt-and-banking crisis that has roiled the monetary union since 2010 has steadily exposed the realities at play here, as irrevocably fixed exchange rates lock in and deepen differences in eurozone members’ competitiveness.	自2010年以来一直困扰着货币联盟的主权债务及银行危机已经逐步暴露了当前的现实，这是由于无法取消的固定汇率锁定以及不断分化的欧元区成员国竞争力。
In France’s case, the loss of competitiveness and resulting sharp decline in export performance has been aggravated by relying on crushing taxation of labor to finance generous welfare programs and top-drawer public services (a practice exacerbated by stifling labor-market regulation).	就法国来说，竞争力流失并因此导致的出口急剧下降状况不断加重，因为政府对劳动者施加重税来资助慷慨的社会福利计划以及高端公共服务（这种作为又在极端死板的劳动力市场监管之下进一步恶化了 ） 。
In a monetary union, there are only two ways to close a competitiveness gap between countries: transfers from the more competitive to the less competitive, or internal devaluation, which means real wage cuts.	在一个货币联盟内部，只有两种方法来消除国家之间的竞争力差距：从比较有竞争力的地方转移财富到竞争力较低之处，或者实施内部贬值 — — 这意味着削减实际工资。
Not surprisingly, the preference has been for transfers, which, until the 2008 financial crash, took the form of cross-border private-sector lending to governments and banks.	不出所料，人们一直都倾向于实施转移支付，在2008年金融危机之前以跨国私人部门给政府和银行贷款的形式进行。
Following the credit-bubble burst in 2008, fiscal transfers replaced these private financial flows, causing budget deficits to balloon.	随着2008年信贷泡沫破灭，财政转移取代了这些私人资金流，这导致了预算赤字膨胀。
And now, with the German government, as chief creditor, calling the shots on cross-border transfers to weaker eurozone countries, all such transfers are conditional on austerity (that is, internal devaluation).	而今德国政府作为主要债权人操纵着对弱势欧元区国家的跨国转移支付，而所有这些转移都是以实施紧缩为条件的（也就是内部贬值 ） 。
Bailouts from the European Stability Mechanism represent the clearest example of this, with the fiscal compact now committing signatories to tight deficit targets and structural adjustment.	欧洲稳定机制的救助就是最具代表性的例子 — — 财政契约要求签署国制订严格的赤字目标和结构调整承诺。
And more austerity is a vital, if less well remarked on, condition of the European Central Bank’s declared willingness to buy unlimited quantities of troubled countries’ short-term government debt.	如果要欧洲央行无限量购买受困国家短期政府债务的话，条件就是要实施更多的紧缩（对这一点的讨论不多 ） 。
So far, the “bazooka” represented by the ECB’s “outright monetary transactions” program has had the desired effect – without having to be used.	迄今为止，以欧洲央行的“直接货币交易”项目为代表的“绝招”已经起到了预期效果 — — 根本不需要被使用。
Eurozone financial markets have stabilized, and the euro has appreciated against the dollar and the yen.	欧元区金融市场已经稳定了，且欧元对美元和日元实现了升值。
But, as Hollande’s recent declarations indicate, currency appreciation is the last thing that an uncompetitive country like France needs.	但是正如奥朗德最近的声明所指出的一样，货币升值是法国这样缺乏竞争力的国家最不想看到的。
Although the French government, unlike its Spanish and Italian counterparts, has not yet had any difficulty financing itself at low interest rates, currency appreciation as the economy slides into recession is like fuel poured onto an unlit bonfire.	尽管法国政府跟西班牙和意大利两国政府有所区别，可以毫无困难地以低利率为自身融资，但在国家经济进入衰退时货币升值就像向未点燃的篝火增加燃料一样。
Unless growth is restored, France’s already large public debt will expand unsustainably, heightening the risk that investors will shun French government bonds.	除非恢复增长，否则法国本已庞大的公共债务将会不可持续地扩大下去，这会增加投资者放弃购买法国政府债券的风险。
From this predicament stems the fashionable idea that the bond market would actually welcome less fiscal austerity, because this would boost economic growth, in turn making the level of public debt appear more sustainable in the long run.	在这种困境中催生出一种流行理念：债券市场实际上欢迎更少的财政紧缩，因为这样才能促进经济增长，从而使公共债务水平在长期上显得更可持续。
It is no surprise that Moscovici is beginning to push for a “collective European decision” to relax the fiscal treaty’s terms, given that French compliance would require massive new spending cuts.	所以莫斯科维奇开始努力争取“欧洲集体决策”以放宽财政条约条款的做法就并不奇怪，尤其是考虑到法国许下的承诺将需要新一轮的大规模开支削减。
Will Germany agree to such a relaxation – or, for that matter, to Hollande’s implicit demand that the ECB follow Japan’s example and loosen monetary policy to drive the exchange rate back down?	德国会同意这种的放宽行为吗 — — 或者就此而言，德国会同意奥朗德的隐性要求 — — 欧洲央行跟随日本的步伐放松货币政策让汇率再降回来吗？
Unlike Japan (and, of course, the United States), France, as a member of a monetary union, cannot pursue domestic goals unilaterally.	不似日本（显然也不似美国 ） ， 法国作为货币联盟的成员国无法单方面追求本国利益。
To avoid disaster, France has only two options: somehow force a change in German policy or go it alone.	为了避免灾难，法国只有两个选择：以某种方式促使德国改变主意，或者单干。
There are two reasons why, until now, the second option – leaving the monetary union – has been unthinkable.	有两种原因可以解释为什么迄今为止第二个选择 — — 脱离货币联盟 — — 是不可想象的。
The first has to do with economic and financial risks.	第一个原因与经济金融风险有关。
Ditching the euro might trigger a banking crisis, capital flight, inflation, and perhaps even sovereign default.	甩开欧元可能会引发银行业危机，资金外流，通货膨胀甚至有可能是主权违约。
On the other hand, higher competitiveness and erosion of the real value of debt would quickly outweigh these costs by restoring confidence in the French economy’s prospects.	但另一方面，更高的竞争力和债务实际价值的腐蚀将使人们对法国经济的前景恢复信心，其收益也会很快高于上述（脱离）所带来的成本。
This strategy’s success, starting with the speed of restored access to external financing, would depend on the credibility of government policies – monetary, fiscal, and, above all, the radical and indispensable supply-side reforms for which there would now be breathing space.	这种策略的成功，从重新获得外部融资的速度开始，将取决于政府政策的公信力 — — 货币的，财政的，尤其是激进且不可或缺的供应方面改革 — — 从而获得喘息的空间。
The specter of continuing economic stagnation and ever-rising unemployment (with the young and older workers being the worst hit) should remove the second, geopolitical obstacle to a French exit from the eurozone.	持续的经济停滞和不断上升的失业率（对年轻和年老的工人影响最大）阴影应该移除了第二个地缘障碍，使得法国可以从欧元区中退出来。
For French elites since World War II, alignment with Germany has been central to projecting French power and influence.	自从二战以后，对法国精英来说，与德国保持一致对突出法国权力和影响力一直很重要。
Such ambitions must now be sacrificed for the sake of the French public’s well-being.	而为了法国的公众利益必须牺牲这种野心。
France will not regain its economic strength without setting aside the euro.	除非退出欧元，否则法国将无法恢复其经济力量。
Even during that adjustment, there is no reason why relations with European partners should suffer in any fundamental sense.	即使是作出了这样的调整，也没有理由会让它与欧洲伙伴关系的基本面受到什么影响。
On the contrary, the sustainable prosperity that would result from that adjustment would create a much healthier long-term foundation for continuing the quest for an “ever closer union” in Europe.	相反，由于这种调整导致的可持续繁荣将会为继续在欧洲寻求一个“更紧密的联盟”创造一个更加健康的长期基础。
	
Why France Will Sink Europe’s Constitution	法国为何反对欧洲宪法
If public opinion polls are to be believed, on May 29 the French will reject the European Union’s draft constitutional treaty.	如果民意测验可信的话，那么法国人将在5月29号反对欧盟的宪法条约草案。
Because all EU member countries must ratify the constitution, a French “Non” will, in effect, kill it.	因为宪法必须得到所有欧盟成员国的批准，事实上法国的一句“不”将否决此草案。
Amazing as this turn of events seems, it has been long in the making.	尽管这件事情的转折颇让人诧异，但也并非空穴来风。
It is amazing because France is not just a founding member of the European Community, but also has been the main driving force behind all major steps toward “ever closer union.”	它之所以让人诧异是因为法国不仅仅是欧盟共同体的创建国之一，也是为实现“前所未有的紧密联邦”而实施的所有重大步骤背后的主要推动力。
But French opposition was also predictable because, for over a decade now, France has veered away from Europe and now finds itself increasingly isolated.	但是法国会投反对票也并非不可预见，十年多来，法国和欧盟渐行渐远，发现它自己越来越孤立。
Of course, Europe has also moved away from France through successive enlargements, but the main roots of the estrangement lie in France itself.	当然，欧洲也通过不断的扩张和法国越来越疏远。 但是导致这种疏远的主要根源还是在法国本身。
The French regard with great sadness their declining status and prestige – not only in world politics, but also in culture, science and, importantly, language.	法国人十分难过地意识到，他们不仅仅在世界政治，在文化、科学，尤其是语言方面的地位和权威性正在日益下滑。
Europe, in their view, was always a way of reclaiming world influence.	在他们看来，欧洲是一种重新找回世界影响力的方式。
For three decades, this worked.	这种方法三十多年来一直有效。
France and Germany had forged an alliance that called the shots in Europe.	法国和德国已经缔结成一个操纵欧洲的联盟。
Not interested in geopolitical power – a legacy of its Nazi past – Germany was content to back France’s ambitions as long as the Common Market allowed it to be Europe’s economic powerhouse.	德国对它的纳粹历史所留下的地理政治权力并不感兴趣，只要欧洲自由贸易联盟允许它成为欧洲经济强国，德国就会站在法国身后支持它的野心。
But that alliance is unraveling as Germany’s own status declines, owing to its mediocre economic performance and the loss of its prestigious Deutschemark.	但是，由于德国经济表现平平，久负盛名的德国马克又贬值，那个联盟随着德国的地位下降而开始变得清晰。
Moreover, Germany is increasingly interested in exercising political influence on its own; as a result, it is no longer happy with what it gets from the alliance with France.	此外，德国开始越来越有兴趣自己施加政治影响，结果，它再也不满足于那些从与法国的联盟中所获得的东西。
At the same time, successive EU enlargements over the decades have brought in other powerful contenders, chiefly Spain and the UK, as well as smaller countries who are unwilling to bow before French-German leadership.	与此同时，欧盟几十年来的不断扩张也吸引进了其他有力的竞争者，主要是西班牙和英国，以及那些不愿意在法-德领导下俯首称臣的小国家。
In short, France has lost control of Europe.	简而言之，法国已经失去了对欧洲的控制。
This is not new, but it has only recently started to sink in, and it hurts.	这并不新鲜，但是这却是最近才开始被了解，这对法国是个伤害。
France is also economically wounded.	法国在经济上也遭受了损失。
Here is a country that has long cherished its “exception” from the normal rules of market economics, a foggy view that rejects both central planning and free markets and claims to offer a well-balanced middle ground.	法国珍惜它能长期破例游离于市场经济的常规之外，模糊地保持着拒绝中央规划和自由市场的立场，并声称能够在两者之间找到一个更平衡的中立点。
The French do not care that they have never been able to articulate their vision of a “third way,” for they remain deeply convinced that the state has a key role to play in steering markets in order to defend “higher” values from the single-minded pursuit of materialism.	法国人不在乎他们从未能够清楚阐明他们对“第三种办法”的看法，因为他们坚信法国在驾驭市场中要扮演着重要的、在单纯追求物质主义中维护“更高的”价值观的角色。
This view, propagated since World War II by a quasi-Marxist intelligentsia, is so ingrained that the French do not even bother to understand how markets operate.	这个观点的宣扬始于二战期间的一群准马克思主义知识分子，现在这个观点根深蒂固，以至于法国人从来就未尝试去理解市场如何运作。
They look upon economics as an ideological battleground, where all views can be entertained without being confronted with logic, much less with facts.	他们把经济看作意识形态的战场，在那里所有的观点不需要直面逻辑就可得出，更不用说面对事实了。
Yet facts have been hitting hard.	然而，事实犹如一记重拳。
Growth has been lackluster for a quarter of a century and unemployment remains stubbornly high.	二十五年来经济增长毫无亮点，失业率居高不下。
Urban crime, once described as the wages of unfettered individualism, now resembles what is found in the United States, the French model’s bête noire.	曾一度被描写为解放个人主义浪潮代表的城市犯罪率，现在就和美国的差不多，令人深恶痛绝。
What has this to do with Europe?	这和欧洲有什么关系呢？
The EU, by design, increases economic competition, but France is ill equipped.	欧盟故意加强了经济竞争，但是法国毫无准备。
One after the other, most European countries have reformed their economies, shedding the cozy arrangements that used to protect every interest group from the pressure of competition.	欧洲国家一个接一个地进行了经济改革，揭走了原本用以保护每个利益集团免受竞争压力的温暖“外衣 ” 。
Even Germany, after even worse performance than France, has now taken decisive steps.	即使是德国，在经历了比法国更为糟糕的表现之后，现在也采取了决定性的措施。
Unable to reform their labor markets because of the fear of street protests, French governments of all political stripes seek to protect their ailing firms, only to face limits imposed by the rules of the Common Market.	由于害怕改革劳力市场会引发游街抗议，法国政府寻求方法以保护他们体制不全的公司，结果却发现不得不面对共同市场所强加的规定条例。
The bloated French public sector, which many see as the employer of last resort, cannot afford its expensive personnel.	人浮于事的公共部门，虽然被许多人视为最后希望，却难以承受如此昂贵的人员费用。
While many private French firms are thriving, they do so by economizing on manpower and, increasingly, by outsourcing production, often to new EU member countries where labor costs are considerably lower.	但是许多法国私人公司通过节约人力成本以及逐渐通过把生产外包给那些新加入欧盟的成员国（因为它们的劳力成本相对较低）而生意兴隆。
Public education is in shambles and France’s higher education system now faces competition from other European countries.	公共教育步履蹒跚，法国的高等教育体系现在正面临着来自于其他欧洲国家的竞争压力。
Humbled by economic malaise and loss of influence, the French are scared.	受到经济不振和影响力衰退的影响，法国人的恐惧油然而生。
They fear the future, because the future means either market-oriented reforms or further economic and political downgrading, both of which are seen as unacceptable, if only because they clash with French self-esteem.	他们害怕未来，因为未来意味着不是以市场为导向的改革就是经济和政治地位继续下降，只要它们严重挫伤了法国人的自尊，这两者看来都是难以接受的。
The European Constitution has little to do with any of these challenges, but a majority of French people has started questioning the strategy that has long masked France’s diminishing status.	欧洲宪法和这些挑战毫无关系，但是大部分法国人已经开始质疑那个长期以来掩饰着法国日益衰弱的地位的策略。
They are alarmed by what they see as the domination of Anglo-Saxon economic principles – the last nail in the coffin of France’s mythical “exception.”	被他们看作统治地位的盎格鲁-萨克逊的经济政策 — — 法国虚构的“例外”政策的致命一击 — — 向他们发出了警告。
So the EU is now seen as the Trojan horse that threatens the myriad of state-sanctioned benefits and handouts that every citizen enjoys.	因此，现在欧盟被看作一个木马，威胁着无数每个公民所享有的批准认可的利益和福利。
Of course, most French people would ultimately benefit from doing away with this inefficient web of big and small privileges, but most voters, depressed by poor economic prospects and unnerved by high unemployment, are simply unwilling to take the risk.	当然，大多数法国人将最终会从废除这个充斥着大小特权的低效网络中获利，但是由于对萧条的经济前景感到失望，对居高不下的失业率心存不安，多数投票者就是不愿意冒险。
They do not understand the roots of their economic troubles and are nostalgic for better times.	他们并不明白他们经济问题的根源所在，对昔日的繁荣无尽留恋。
They mistakenly see the European Constitution as one more challenge, at a time when they want to be nursed and protected.	在他们想要被照顾和保护的时候，他们错误地把欧洲宪法看作了一个更艰巨的挑战。
Scared people rarely make wise choices.	恐惧的人们很少会做出聪明的抉择。
	
Bismarck versus Bismarck	俾斯麦与俾斯麦
ATHENS – The centrality of Germany to Europe and, more widely, to world affairs has been amply, and often bloodily, demonstrated over many centuries.	雅典—欧洲，以及更广泛的世界事务德国中心论已经在几百年的历史中印证了多次，且往往是血淋淋的教训。
Indeed, Germany’s strategic position at the heart of Europe, as well as its huge economic and military potential, made it first a prize to be sought, and then, following Otto von Bismarck’s completion of German unification in 1871, a nation-state to be feared.	事实上，德国处于欧洲的战略中心，又具有巨大的经济和军事潜力，这使它成为列强垂涎的肥肉，继而在1871年俾斯麦完成德国统一后又成为可怕的民族国家。
Bismarck’s legacy was a Germany that dominated European politics until the end of World War II.	俾斯麦身后留下的德国一直主导着欧洲政治，直到二战结束。
That legacy is now reasserting itself.	俾斯麦的这一遗产正在卷土重来。
After the interlude of the Cold War, during which Germany served as the center of discord between East and West, reunification permitted the reassertion of German power within the context of the European Union and, most notably, the eurozone.	在冷战的插曲后 — — 此间德国一直是东西方对峙的中心 — — 重新统一让德国的实力在欧盟的环境中（以及更加令人瞩目地在欧元区的环境中）重新崛起。
Today, however, the question is whether Germany is ready and willing to provide leadership in the conduct of the EU’s affairs – and, if so, to what end.	但是，如今，问题变成德国是否做好准备也愿意在欧盟事务上起到领导作用，以及，如果答案是肯定的，它会走得多远。
Europe is currently facing its most challenging crisis of the postwar period.	当前，欧洲正面临战后时期最具挑战性的危机。
After six quarters of recession, the slump is spreading to the eurozone’s core countries.	在六个季度的衰退后，经济崩溃开始蔓延到核心国。
Unemployment, above 12% on average, is at a record high.	平均12%以上的失业率处于历史最高值。
In Spain and Greece, more than one-quarter of the labor force is jobless, while the unemployment rate hovers around 60% among young people.	在西班牙和希腊，四分之一以上劳动力找不到工作，年轻人失业率更是徘徊在60 % 。
Despite harsh austerity, large fiscal deficits persist, and banks remain undercapitalized and unable to support a sustained economic recovery.	尽管采取了严厉的紧缩，但巨额赤字依然存在，银行依然资金不足，无法支持持续经济复苏。
Social malaise is deepening as expectations – and actual prospects – for economic improvement are likely to remain poor for the foreseeable future.	在可预见的未来，经济改善的预期 — — 以及实际前景 — — 可能仍将萎靡不振，这深化了社会不安。
Faith in the European project is declining, and, given the eurozone’s lack of cohesion, stagnation and recession may lead to popular rejection of the EU, accompanied by serious challenges to democracy, including the rise of neo-fascist parties.	对欧洲工程的新年正在衰退，而由于欧元区缺少团结，停滞和衰退可能导致公众拒绝欧盟，并伴生对民主的严重挑战（比如新法西斯政党的崛起 ） 。
And yet, despite the risks, European leaders remain remarkably inactive, apparently reassured by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to protect the monetary union from collapse.	此外，尽管风险重重，但欧洲领导人令人惊讶地鲜有作为，这显然是吃了欧洲央行德拉吉的定心丸 — — 他承诺“竭尽全力”保护货币联盟不会崩溃。
But prolonged inaction, induced by relative calm in financial markets, will perpetuate stagnation and eventually lead to a breakup of one sort or another.	但金融市场的相对冷静所导致的长时间不作为会让停滞长久化，最终形成某种形式的崩溃。
Either gradual attrition, with weaker countries defaulting, will lead to a more restricted German-led club of “virtuous” countries, or Germany itself will choose to pursue a policy of narrow fiscal advantage by seceding from the eurozone.	要么逐渐深化的摩擦以及疲软国的违约导致形成德国领导的“优等”国家俱乐部；要么德国本身选择通过脱离欧元区缩小财政优势的政策。
The political and economic weakness of France and Italy, together with Britain’s gradual withdrawal from EU affairs, highlight Germany’s key role in rescuing the eurozone from the current crisis.	意大利和法国的政治和经济弱势，以及英国的逐渐从欧盟事务中抽身凸显出德国在当前危机中捍卫欧元区的关键作用。
But true leadership requires a sense of direction and a willingness to pay up, and, here, Germany has lately been found wanting.	但真正的领导力要求方向感以及花血本的意愿，而在这方面，德国不能令人信服。
Despite German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s evident political skills and high domestic standing, her government lacks a concrete design for “ever closer Union” in Europe.	尽管德国总理默克尔拥有令人信服的政治技巧和高度的国内支持，但她的政府缺少关于欧洲“更紧密联盟”的具体设计。
As a result, it, too, is in a weak position to mobilize the resources and competences required to restore Europe.	结果，德国自身在动员重塑欧洲的资源和能力方面所处的位置也相当不利。
Instead, Merkel’s Germany has been doing as little as possible, as late as possible, to prevent the euro’s collapse.	在防止欧元崩溃方面，默克尔的德国能拖则拖，能少做则少做。
This policy cannot endure for long.	这一政策无法长时间持续。
Either stagnation will lead to the eurozone’s breakup, or circumstances will force a policy change.	要么停滞导致欧元区崩溃，要么环境迫使政策变化。
So, in which areas must Germany lead?	那么，在哪些领域德国必须担起领导之责？
First, European public debt should be partly and gradually mutualized.	首先，欧洲公共债务必须部分地、逐渐地共同化。
National banking systems should be unified, in order to separate private losses from sovereign debt, with centralized supervision and resolution authorities, as well as a deposit-insurance scheme, forming the core of a European banking union.	国家银行体系应该统一起来，从而将私人损失与主权债务隔离，并以集中监督和清算当局（以及一个存款保险制度）形成欧洲银行联盟的核心。
Strong central institutions, responsible to a directly elected parliament, are needed to coordinate fiscal and economic policies.	必须由对直选议院负责的强大的中央机构负责协调财政和经济政策。
In the shorter term, the single market should be extended to services, and free-trade arrangements should be promoted either multilaterally or bilaterally with major trading partners such as the United States.	子短期，单一市场应该扩大至服务业，与美国等主要贸易伙伴的自由贸易协定应该在多边和双边维度上都得到促进。
Austerity should be eased, particularly in the fiscally stronger core economies, and substantial resources should be devoted to boosting youth employment and investment in small and medium-size firms in the over-indebted countries.	紧缩应该放松特别是在财政较坚挺的核心经济体，应该将大量资源用于提振过度负债国年轻人就业和中小企业投资上。
Germany’s reluctance to lead on these issues partly reflects historical inhibitions, which are always difficult to overcome.	德国不愿在这些问题上带头，这部分反映了历史性的抑制，很难克服。
The persistence of pre-Keynesian orthodoxy in German economic thought, with its moral abhorrence of the “sin of borrowing” (and thus its neglect of aggregate demand), does not help, either.	德国经济思想以前凯恩斯时代的思想为正统，德国人从道德上讨厌“借贷的罪恶 ” （ 而因此忽视总需求 ） ， 这也起不了促进作用。
The federalist structure of Germany’s political system, moreover, favors parochial approaches over grander designs.	此外，德国政治制度的联邦型结构有利于各自为政，不利于顶层设计。
Nonetheless, Germany must accept that the alternative to a democratically unified currency union is German economic hegemony.	尽管如此，德国必须接受民主统一的货币联盟的替代方案是德国经济霸权。
In the longer run, that outcome would destroy the common European project, in turn undermining Germany’s own economic prosperity and strategic security – a Bismarckian scenario from which Bismarck would have recoiled in horror.	从长期看，这一结果将摧毁共同的欧洲工程，并反过来破坏德国自身的经济繁荣和战略安全 — — 这是俾斯麦都要不寒而栗的俾斯麦式情景。
	
Why Germany Should Lead or Leave	德国为什么应该负起领导责任或者离开欧盟
NEW YORK – Europe has been in a financial crisis since 2007.	纽约 — — 2007年以来欧洲一直身处金融危机。
When the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers endangered the credit of financial institutions, private credit was replaced by the credit of the state, revealing an unrecognized flaw in the euro.	雷曼兄弟破产危及金融机构信贷导致国家信贷挤出私人信贷，进而彰显了欧元不为人知的问题。
By transferring their right to print money to the European Central Bank (ECB), member countries exposed themselves to the risk of default, like Third World countries heavily indebted in a foreign currency.	因为将印钞权交给欧洲央行（ECB ） ， 欧盟成员国像背负巨额外币债的第三世界国家一样承担着债务违约的风险。
Commercial banks loaded with weaker countries’ government bonds became potentially insolvent.	大量持有弱国政府债的商业银行随时可能破产。
There is a parallel between the ongoing euro crisis and the international banking crisis of 1982.	持续不断的欧元危机和1982年的国际金融危机有共通之处。
Back then, the International Monetary Fund saved the global banking system by lending just enough money to heavily indebted countries; default was avoided, but at the cost of a lasting depression.	当时国际货币基金组织借钱给负债累累的国家，将将能够挽救全球银行体系；债务违约得以避免，但代价却是旷日持久的经���低迷。
Latin America suffered a lost decade.	拉美国家失去了宝贵的十年时光。
Germany is playing the same role today as the IMF did then.	今天的德国扮演了当时国际货币基金组织的角色。
The setting differs, but the effect is the same.	当然环境不同，但效果一致。
Creditors are shifting the entire burden of adjustment on to the debtor countries and avoiding their own responsibility.	债权国把调整的一切负担一股脑推卸给债务国，逃避自己应该承担的责任。
The euro crisis is a complex mixture of banking and sovereign-debt problems, as well as divergences in economic performance that have given rise to balance-of-payments imbalances within the eurozone.	欧元危机综合了银行及主权债务问题，还有因经济表现落差造成的欧元区国际收支失衡。
The authorities did not understand the complexity of the crisis, let alone see a solution.	当局根本不了解这场危机的复杂性，更诓论拿出解决方案。
So they tried to buy time.	因此他们试图争取时间。
Usually, that works.	这种方法往往能够奏效。
Financial panics subside, and the authorities realize a profit on their intervention.	一旦金融恐慌消退，当局的干预行为就可以实现利润。
But not this time, because the financial problems were combined with a process of political disintegration.	可这次不同，因为财政问题还伴随着政治解体的过程。
When the European Union was created, it was the embodiment of an open society – a voluntary association of equal states that surrendered part of their sovereignty for the common good.	欧盟创立时曾是开放社会的化身 — — 平等的国家自愿加入，为了实现共同的利益而放弃部分主权。
The euro crisis is now turning the EU into something fundamentally different, dividing member countries into two classes – creditors and debtors – with the creditors in charge.	但欧元危机彻底改变了欧盟的性质，将成员国区隔为两大类 — — 债权人和债务人 — — 而且由债权人说了算。
As the strongest creditor country, Germany has emerged as the hegemon.	身为最强债权国的德国已经掌握了霸权。
Debtor countries pay substantial risk premiums for financing their government debt.	债务国被迫为政府融资支付巨额的风险溢价。
This is reflected in their cost of financing in general.	这在它们的融资成本中得到充分的体现。
To make matters worse, the Bundesbank remains committed to an outmoded monetary doctrine rooted in Germany’s traumatic experience with inflation.	更有甚者，德国央行（Bundesbank）仍然死抱住从德国惨痛的通胀经历中总结出来的过时的货币学说。
As a result, it recognizes only inflation as a threat to stability, and ignores deflation, which is the real threat today.	因此它只承认通胀会威胁稳定，但却忽视今天造成现实威胁的通货紧缩。
Moreover, Germany’s insistence on austerity for debtor countries can easily become counterproductive by increasing the debt ratio as GDP falls.	此外，德国坚持要求债务国紧缩很容易适得其反，导致国内生产总值下降的同时负债率飙升。
There is a real danger that a two-tier Europe will become permanent.	二元化欧洲永久化的危险是切实存在的。
Both human and financial resources will be attracted to the center, leaving the periphery permanently depressed. But the periphery is seething with discontent.	人力和财力资源都将被吸引到核心国家，导致外围国家经济长期低迷，引发了外围国家的强烈不满。
Europe’s tragedy is not the result of an evil plot, but stems, rather, from a lack of coherent policies.	欧洲的悲剧不是因为邪恶的阴谋，而是缺乏一以贯之的政策。
As in ancient Greek tragedies, misconceptions and a sheer lack of understanding have had unintended but fateful consequences.	这就好比古希腊悲剧，误解和纯粹的理解缺失造成了始料未及但却非常致命的后果。
Germany, as the largest creditor country, is in charge, but refuses to take on additional liabilities; as a result, every opportunity to resolve the crisis has been missed.	最大的债权国德国掌握话语权，但却拒绝负担额外的债务；结果是解决危机的每一次机会都被白白地错过。
The crisis spread from Greece to other deficit countries, eventually calling into question the euro’s very survival.	危机已经从希腊蔓延到其他赤字国家，最终就连欧元的生存都受到了威胁。
Since a breakup of the euro would cause immense damage, Germany always does the minimum necessary to hold it together.	因为欧元解体会造成巨额损失，德国总是采取最低限度的措施防止欧元垮掉。
Most recently, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has backed ECB President Mario Draghi, leaving Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann isolated.	最近，德国总理安格拉·默克尔（Angela Merkel）表态支持了欧洲央行行长马里奥·德拉吉，从而孤立了德意志联邦银行行长基恩斯·魏德曼。
This will enable the ECB to put a lid on the borrowing costs of countries that submit to an austerity program under the supervision of the Troika (the IMF, the ECB, and the European Commission).	这意味着欧洲央行能为提交由国际货币基金组织、欧洲央行和欧洲委员会这三驾马车共同监管的财政紧缩计划的国家设定借贷成本上限。
That will save the euro, but it is also a step toward the permanent division of Europe into debtors and creditors.	这种做法可以挽救欧元，但同时也朝着将欧洲永久划分为债权国和债务国的情境迈近了一步。
The debtors are bound to reject a two-tier Europe sooner or later.	债务国一方迟早会拒绝接受两元化的欧洲。
If the euro breaks up in disarray, the common market and the EU will be destroyed, leaving Europe worse off than it was when the effort to unite it began, owing to a legacy of mutual mistrust and hostility.	欧元分崩离析会彻底破坏欧盟共同市场，只剩下两大阵营的相互敌视和不信任，从而致使欧洲比欧盟成立以前的情况还要糟糕。
The later the breakup, the worse the ultimate outcome.	分崩离析的时间越长，最终的结果就愈糟。
So it is time to consider alternatives that until recently would have been inconceivable.	因此现在是时候考虑就在不久前还根本无法想象的选择。
In my judgment, the best course of action is to persuade Germany to choose between either leading the creation of a political union with genuine burden-sharing, or leaving the euro.	依我判断，最好的方法莫过于说服德国在带头创建切实分担责任的政治联盟和离开欧元区之间做出选择。
Since all of the accumulated debt is denominated in euros, it makes all the difference who remains in charge of the monetary union.If Germany left, the euro would depreciate.	因为所有累积债务无一例外地采用欧元计价，所以货币联盟由谁来领导效果会截然不同。
Debtor countries would regain their competitiveness; their debt would diminish in real terms; and, with the ECB under their control, the threat of default would disappear and their borrowing costs would fall to levels comparable to that in the United Kingdom.	德国离开会造成欧元贬值，债务国的竞争力就会逐渐恢复；它们的实际债务将会减少，而且因为控制着欧洲央行，它们违约的风险将会解除，而且它们的借贷成本将下降到和英国差不多。
The creditor countries, by contrast, would incur losses on their claims and investments denominated in euros and encounter stiffer competition at home from other eurozone members.	反之，债权国以欧元计价的投资和债权将会遭受亏损，同时还要面对来自欧元区其他成员国的激烈竞争。
The extent of creditor countries’ losses would depend on the extent of the depreciation, giving them an interest in keeping the depreciation within bounds.	债权国损失的大小将取决于欧元贬值的程度，它们的切身利益会促使它们限制欧元的贬值。
After initial dislocations, the eventual outcome would fulfill John Maynard Keynes’ dream of an international currency system in which both creditors and debtors share responsibility for maintaining stability.	经过最初的错位之后，最终的结果将会实现约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯的梦想，建立债权和债务国共担维稳责任的国际货币制度。
And Europe would avert the looming depression.	这样欧洲就能躲过迫在眉睫的经济衰退。
The same result could be achieved, with less cost to Germany, if Germany chose to behave as a benevolent hegemon.	如果德国选择充当一位仁慈的霸主，那么它可以付出较小的代价取得相同的结果。
That would mean implementing the proposed European banking union; establishing a more or less level playing field between debtor and creditor countries by establishing a Debt Reduction Fund, and eventually converting all debt into Eurobonds; and aiming at nominal GDP growth of up to 5%, so that Europe could grow its way out of excessive indebtedness.	其中应当包括落实拟议中的欧洲银行联盟；成立减债基金为债权国和债务国创造相对公平的竞争环境，以及最终将所有债务转换成欧元债券的形式。 此外还要设定名义国内生产总值5%的增长目标，这样欧洲就可以通过经济增长摆脱过度负债的困境。
Whether Germany decides to lead or leave, either alternative would be better than creating an unsustainable two-tier Europe.	无论德国最终决定领导还是离开，这两种选择都强过造成一个不可持续的二元化的欧洲。
	
Why Greece Declined a Euro Holiday	为何希腊拒绝欧元节日
BRUSSELS – For the entire first half of this year, since the far-left, anti-austerity Syriza party came to power in January, the Greek saga virtually monopolized the attention of European policymakers.	布鲁塞尔—在今年整个上半年，自极左翼的反紧缩政党左翼联盟（Syriza）在1月份开始掌权以来，希腊神话几乎垄断了欧洲决策者的注意力。
Even as their country’s economy crashed, Greece’s new government remained adamant in demanding debt relief without austerity – that is, until mid-July, when they suddenly agreed to the creditors’ terms.	虽然希腊经济崩盘，但新政府仍固执地要求不以紧缩为条件的债务纾困 — — 直到7月中旬突然同意债权人的条件。
Indeed, as of July 13, Greece’s staunchly anti-austerity government has been obliged to impose even tougher austerity and pursue painful structural reforms, under its creditors’ close supervision.	事实上，在7月13日，希腊坚定的反紧缩政府被迫在债权人的严密监督下实施更加严厉的紧缩措施、追求痛苦的结构改革。
Why did the Greek government concede to terms that not only controverted its own promises, but also closely resembled those that voters had overwhelmingly rejected in a popular referendum barely a week earlier?	为何希腊政府要屈服于这些条件？ 它们不但有悖于希腊政府自身的承诺，也与选民们在不到一周前的全民公决中一边倒地拒绝了的条件别无二致。
Many believe that Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was responding to an ultimatum from his European partners: Accept our demands or leave the euro.	许多人认为这是希腊总理齐普拉斯对其欧洲伙伴国最后通牒的反应：要么接受条件，要么离开欧元区。
The question is why a Greek exit from the euro (“Grexit”) amounted to such a potent threat.	问题是为何希腊退出欧元区 （ “ 希腊退出 ” ） 构成了如此有力的威胁。
In fact, from an economic perspective, Grexit no longer represents the potential catastrophe that it once did.	事实上，从经济角度讲，希腊退出已不再像从前那样是一场潜在的灾难。
After all, the main short-term cost – financial-system disruption – has already materialized in Greece: banks and the stock market have been shut down, and capital controls have been imposed.	毕竟，主要短期成本 — — 金融体系动荡 — — 在希腊已是既成事实：银行和股市关门大吉，资本管制也开始实施。
While those actions were needed to stem large-scale capital flight and prevent the banking system’s collapse, they also caused the Greek economy to contract sharply.	这些动作是阻止大规模资本外逃、防止银行体系崩溃的必要措施，但也导致希腊经济急剧衰退。
In this context, Greek negotiators might have considered another proposal, circulated informally by the German finance ministry, recommending that Greece receive immediate debt forgiveness, in exchange for leaving the euro temporarily.	在这一背景下，希腊谈判者也许想到了由德国财政部长提出的另一个方案，即建议希腊立刻获得债务豁免，条件是它暂时退出欧元区。
If Greece remained in the euro, no relief would be granted – a proviso consistent with the German position that debt restructuring for eurozone countries would be illegal.	如果希腊留在欧元区，就不会有债务纾困 — — 这一附带条件与德国所持的欧元区国家债务重组不合法的立场相符。
While the legal argument is probably spurious, an outright debt reduction for a eurozone country remains politically impossible.	也许法律争议只是借口，但直接减免欧元区国家的债务在政治上仍不可行。
The German proposal, spearheaded by Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble, highlights the fundamental change that has occurred in Greece’s relationship with its European partners since its last bailout package three years ago.	由其财政部长朔伊布勒（Wolfgang Schäuble）提出的德国方案凸显出三年前上一次援助方案实施以来希腊与其欧洲伙伴国关系所发生的根本性变化。
In 2012, Greece was offered hundreds of billions of euros in financial support, and its creditors, including Greek commercial banks, were pushed to accept substantial “voluntary” haircuts.	2012年，希腊获得了数千亿美元的金融支持，其包括希腊商业银行在内的债权人被迫接受巨额“自愿”剃头（haircuts ） 。
Tellingly, when George Papandreou, Greece’s prime minister at the time, proposed a referendum on the existing adjustment program and his country’s continued eurozone membership in 2011, he was warned off in no uncertain terms by France’s then-President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.	最能说明问题的是，当时任希腊总理帕潘德里欧（George Papandreou）在2011年提出就现有调整计划以及希腊欧元区成员资格进行全民公投的时候，时任法国总统萨科齐（Nicolas Sarkozy）和德国总理默克尔断然警告他不要这样做。
Though Papandreou would have campaigned for the adjustment program and the euro, a referendum was a risk that his European partners were unwilling to take.	尽管帕潘德里欧支持调整计划和欧元，但公投是其欧洲伙伴国不愿承担的风险。
Tsipras’s government, by contrast, was able to hold its referendum, and even campaign against the creditors’ proposed adjustment program (which, it should be noted, was no longer on the table).	相反，齐普拉斯政府能够举行公投，甚至反对债权人提出的调整计划（应该指出，调整计划已不再是谈判内容 ） 。
Even the resounding “no” delivered by Greek voters could not strengthen the government’s negotiating position, for a simple reason: Grexit is no longer considered a threat to the euro’s stability.	而即使是希腊选民掷地有声的“不 ” ， 也无法增强希腊政府的谈判立场。 原因很简单：希腊退出已不再被认为是欧元稳定性的威胁。
That is why German officials – especially Schäuble – have been encouraging Greece to leave.	正因如此，德国官员 — — 特别是朔伊布勒 — — 一直在鼓励希腊退出。
One can only speculate about Schäuble’s motivation in pushing for Grexit.	我们只能猜测朔伊布勒鼓动希腊退出的动机。
He seems to believe that a more integrated eurozone, though certainly desirable, is not feasible with a country that cannot be trusted to abide by the terms to which its government has agreed.	他似乎认为，尽管更加一体化的欧元区毫无疑问令人渴望，但如果无法相信其中一个国家会遵守其政府所同意的条件，欧元区就无从实现进一步一体化。
Whatever Schäuble’s reasons, his proposal could have represented a way out for Greece, whose economy had been squeezed dry by austerity and whose banking system was already closed.	不管朔伊布勒的理由为何，他的方案代表了希腊的一条出路。 希腊经济已经被紧缩榨干，其银行体系也已经关门。
Immediate debt reduction and the recovery of economic sovereignty – even at the expense of exiting the euro, at least temporarily – would seem to have offered significant long-term benefits.	立刻获得债务减免和重获经济主权 — — 即使以至少是暂时性地退出欧元区为代价 — — 似乎提供了巨大的长期好处。
In a sense, it amounted to a golden opportunity, with Germany offering to pay for something that many believe Greece should be doing anyway.	从某种程度上讲，这是一个黄金机会，德国提出为某些许多人认为希腊无论如何应该做的事买单。
Nonetheless, the Greek government rejected an exit, and instead accepted the creditors’ tough terms.	尽管如此，希腊政府拒绝退出欧元区，而是接受了债权人的苛刻条件。
This suggests that, during the negotiations, Greece’s leaders were driven by more than economics.	这表明，在谈判期间，希腊领导人并不仅仅受到经济因素的推动。
Perhaps, contrary to popular belief, countries’ political attachment to Europe via the euro remains very strong, even where, as in Greece, people have endured unprecedented hardship since joining the monetary union.	也许与流行的观念相反，各国通过欧元实现欧洲归属的政治愿望仍十分强烈，即使希腊等国家的人民经历了加入货币联盟以来前所未有的困难。
The monetary union’s rationale, as many have noted, was always more political than economic.	如许多人所注意到的，货币联盟存在的理由永远是政治多于经济。
For precisely that reason, it may well be too early to write off the single currency.	正因如此，勾销单一货币还为时过早。
	
Why Host the World Cup?	为什么要承办世界杯？
NORTHAMPTON, MASSACHUSETTS – Whom would you trust more, Russian President Vladimir Putin or Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel?	发自马萨诸塞州北安普顿 — — 如果要在俄罗斯总统普京还是芝加哥市长拉姆·伊曼纽尔（Rahm Emanuel）选择一个人，你会更信任谁？
Whereas Putin is reveling in the attention that Russia is receiving as host of the 2018 World Cup, Emanuel has informed the US Soccer Federation and FIFA that Chicago has no interest in serving as a host city when the event comes to North America in 2026.	在普京对俄罗斯作为2018年世界杯主办国所受到的关注感到振奋之时，伊曼纽尔却通知美国足球联合会和国际足联说芝加哥无意在2026年世界杯在北美举办时担任主办城市。
Canada and Mexico will each host ten matches, and the United States will host another 60.	届时加拿大墨西哥将分别承办10场比赛，美国则会承办另外60场。
So why is the third-largest US city taking a pass?	那为何这个美国第三大城市却选择了置身事外？
To understand what it means to host a global sporting event, consider the fact that Putin’s government spent $51-70 billion to stage the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, and is projected to spend at least $14 billion hosting the current World Cup, which runs through July 15.	如果想了解举办全球体育赛事究竟意味着什么，请参考普京政府花费510~700亿美元在索契举办2014年冬奥会，另外还要花费至少140亿美元举办本届世界杯的事实。
Russia’s budget provided for the construction of seven new stadiums – including one in St. Petersburg that cost around $1.7 billion – and renovations to five other venues. And that does not even account for the additional expenses for training facilities, lodging, expanded infrastructure, and security.	俄罗斯的预算被用于建造七座新体育场 — — 其中在圣彼得堡的那座花费约17亿美元 — — 并翻新到其他五个场馆，还不包括培训设施、住宿，配套基础设施和安保等额外费用。
Chicago, having already hosted the opening ceremony and first match of the 1994 World Cup, has adopted quite a different mindset.	曾经举办过1994年世界杯开幕式以及首场比赛的芝加哥则采用了相当不同的思维模式。
Emanuel’s spokesperson, Matt McGrath, recently issued a statement explaining that, “FIFA could not provide a basic level of certainty on some major unknowns that put our city and taxpayers at risk.”	伊曼纽尔的发言人马特·麦克格拉斯（Matt McGrath）最近发表了一份声明，解释说 ： “ 国际足联不能就一些主要未知事项给出一个基本的定数，这可能会使我们的城市和纳税人受到某种损害 。 ”
FIFA, McGrath alleges, was demanding something tantamount to a “blank check,” including an “open-ended ability to modify the agreement … at any time and at their discretion.”	麦格拉斯声称，国际足联要求的东西无异于一张“无限额支票 ” ， 包括”随时随意修改协议的无限制能力 ” 。
Moreover, FIFA would have required that Soldier Field – home to the Chicago Bears football team – be taken out of use for two months prior to the tournament.	此外，国际足联还要求芝加哥熊足球队的主场Soldier Field体育馆在世界杯比赛开始前两个月内停止使用。
In the end, Emanuel’s office concluded that, “The uncertainty for taxpayers, coupled with FIFA’s inflexibility and unwillingness to negotiate, were clear indications that further pursuit of the bid wasn’t in Chicago’s best interests.”	最后伊曼纽尔的办公室得出结论 ： “ 纳税人所面对的不确定性，加上国际足联僵化以及拒绝谈判的态度，明确表明进一步投标承办比赛并不符合芝加哥的最佳利益 。 ”
In addition to holding anywhere from two to six games – potentially over the course of a number of weeks – World Cup host cities are expected to throw a “fan fest,” furnish training facilities for the teams, and provide extensive tax exemptions for a range of activities.	除了在几周的时间内承办两到六场比赛，世界杯主办城市还得举办一场“粉丝盛会 ” ， 为球队翻新训练设施，并为一系列活动提供广泛的税务豁免。
In fact, FIFA prohibits both direct and indirect taxation on all income from the event, exempting continental soccer confederations, host-country broadcasters, and FIFA member associations, service providers, and contractors.	实际上国际足联禁止直接和间接对该赛事的所有收入进行征税，涵盖所有大陆足球联盟，东道国广播公司，国际足联成员协会，服务提供商和承包商。
It is little wonder, then, that Minneapolis and Vancouver have joined Chicago in declining the hosting honor.	这也解释了明尼阿波利斯和温哥华为何会加入芝加哥的行列，婉拒了成为主办城市的殊荣。
To justify its imperious behavior, FIFA points out that, “[the] World Cup is a major sporting event that attracts global attention to the Host Country/Host Countries and provides the opportunity for significant financial investment in sporting and public infrastructure.”	为了说明其傲慢行为的正当性，国际足联指出“世界杯是一个重要的体育赛事，吸引了全球对东道国的关注，并为体育和公共基础设施方面的大规模财政投资提供了机会 。 ”
And that added attention and investment, FIFA claims, “may contribute to significant mid- and long-term socioeconomic benefits … as well as economic growth.”	国际足联称，这种额外的关注和投资“可带来显著的中长期社会经济效益 . . . . . . 以及经济增长 。 ”
But note the carefully qualified language.	但请注意这些仔细拿捏过的言辞。
FIFA only goes so far as to promise an “opportunity for significant financial investment” in infrastructure, as well as attention and investment that “may contribute” to growth.	国际足联只承诺提供在基础设施方面进行大规模财政投资的“机会”以及这些额外关注和投资“可带来”增长。
In reality, scholarly evidence shows that the World Cup rarely benefits host countries and cities as much as FIFA would like the public, and public officials, to think.	事实上有学术研究证据表明世界杯很少会像国际足联希望令公众和公职人员以为的那样对东道国和承办城市有利。
For example, consider what Russia gets in exchange for its $14 billion-plus investment in this year’s event.	以俄罗斯在本届世界杯身上140亿美元投资的回报为例。
While all of the revenue from ticket sales, international broadcasting rights, and sponsorships will go directly to FIFA, Russia will be left with seven new stadiums and five refurbished facilities that it does not need.	门票销售，国际广播权和赞助的所有收入都直接进了国际足联的口袋，而留给俄罗斯的则是七个新的和五个翻新过的体育馆 — — 对于该国来说都没什么用。
And unless it demolishes these venues, it will have to spend tens of millions of dollars every year to maintain them. Meanwhile, hundreds of acres of scarce urban real estate will have been forfeited as sites for white elephants.	除非拆除这些场馆，否则每年还得必须花费数千万美元来进行维护，同时还要征收数百英亩的稀缺城市地块来兴建这些华而不实的建筑。
To be sure, images of sleek new facilities are being disseminated worldwide.	诚然这些新设施都展现在了世界各地的荧幕上。
But the optics are not necessarily working in Russia’s favor.	但这些镜头也不一定对俄罗斯有利。
Apparently, there was no hiding the 6,000 empty seats at the Uruguay-Egypt match on June 15.	比如6月15日的乌拉圭对埃及比赛中就有6000多个空座位赤裸裸地暴露在了观众面前。
If history is any guide, it is highly unlikely that the 2018 World Cup will increase Russia’s international investment or trade, boost its tourism industry, or strengthen its people’s commitment to physical fitness.	如果历史有指导意义的话，那么2018年世界杯很可能对俄罗斯毫无裨益，无论是对其国际投资或贸易，推动其旅游业，或是强化其国民体育锻炼等方面。
What it will do is instill a fleeting sense of national pride among a significant portion of Russians, while offering an ephemeral distraction from the country’s mounting problems.	它能做的是在相当一部分俄罗斯人当中灌输民族自豪感，同时让人们暂时忘记该国日益恶化的各类问题。
With or without the World Cup, oil-price volatility and international sanctions imposed in response to Putin’s 2014 annexation of Crimea will continue to darken Russia’s economic prospects and diminish ordinary Russians’ standard of living.	无论是否承办世界杯，国际油价波动以及针对普京2014年吞并克里米亚所施加的国际制裁将继续使俄罗斯的经济前景变得黯淡，并拉低普通俄罗斯人的生活水平。
So, whom should you trust?	那么在这个事情上你该信任谁？
I’m going with Emanuel.	我就会选择站在芝加哥市长那边。
	
Why India is Riskier than China	为什么印度风险高于中国
NEW HAVEN – Today, fears are growing that China and India are about to be the next victims of the ongoing global economic carnage.	纽黑文 — — 今天，中印两国将成为当前全球经济大屠杀下一个受害者的担忧正越来越强。
This would have enormous consequences.	这将产生严重的后果。
Asia’s developing and newly industrialized economies grew at an 8.5% average annual rate over 2010-11 – nearly triple the 3% growth elsewhere in the world.	亚洲发展中国家及新兴工业化经济体2010－2011年度经济平均年增长速度为8.5 % — —接近世界其他地方3%的三倍之多。
If China and India are next to fall, Asia would be at risk, and it would be hard to avoid a global recession.	如果中印两国经济下滑，亚洲将会陷入危险之中，而且全球经济衰退也将很难避免。
In one important sense, these concerns are understandable: both economies depend heavily on the broader global climate.	从中印经济严重依赖于总体全球环境这个重要意义上，这样的担心是可以理解的。
China is sensitive to downside risks to external demand – more relevant than ever since crisis-torn Europe and the United States collectively accounted for 38% of total exports in 2010.	中国对外部需求的下行风险十分敏感 — — 受危机蹂躏的欧洲和美国共同占据了2010年度出口总额的38 % 。
But India, with its large current-account deficit and external funding needs, is more exposed to tough conditions in global financial markets.	而印度则因其庞大的经常账户赤字和外部资金需求而更多地受到全球金融市场的影响。
Yet fears of hard landings for both economies are overblown, especially regarding China.	但是两国经济硬着陆的担忧被过分夸大，特别是关于中国。
Yes, China is paying a price for aggressive economic stimulus undertaken in the depths of the subprime crisis.	的确，中国正在为其在次贷危机中激进的经济刺激政策而付出代价。
The banking system funded the bulk of the additional spending, and thus is exposed to any deterioration in credit quality that may have arisen from such efforts.	大部分额外支出来自于银行系统，银行因此可能出现由上述措施所导致的信贷质量恶化。
There are also concerns about frothy property markets and mounting inflation.	此外还存在有关房地产市场泡沫化和通胀持续攀升的担忧。
While none of these problems should be minimized, they are unlikely to trigger a hard landing.	尽管上述任何问题都不容小觑，但它们引发经济硬着陆的可能性不大。
Long fixated on stability, Chinese policymakers have been quick to take preemptive action.	一直极端关注稳定的中国决策者已经迅速采取了预防性的行动。
That is particularly evident in Chinese officials’ successful campaign against inflation.	最明显的一点是中国官员已经成功将通胀控制住。
Administrative measures in the agricultural sector, aimed at alleviating supply bottlenecks for pork, cooking oil, fresh vegetables, and fertilizer, have pushed food-price inflation lower.	政府在农业部门采取了旨在缓解猪肉、食用油、蔬菜和化肥等供应瓶颈的行政措施，并成功控制了食品价格的上涨。
This is the main reason why the headline consumer inflation rate receded from 6.5% in July 2011 to 4.2% in November.	整体消费通胀率也因此从2011年7月的6.5%下降到2011年11月的4.2 % 。
Meanwhile, the People’s Bank of China, which hiked benchmark one-year lending rates five times in the 12 months ending this October, to 6.5%, now has plenty of scope for monetary easing should economic conditions deteriorate.	此外，中国人民银行在截止今年十月的12个月内将一年期贷款基准利率上调五倍至6.5 % ， 现在如果经济状况恶化，央行拥有足够的空间放松货币政策。
The same is true with mandatory reserves in the banking sector, where the government has already pruned 50 basis points off the record 21.5% required-reserve ratio.	银行业强制储备金率也是如此。
Relatively small fiscal deficits – only around 2% of GDP in 2010 – leave China with an added dimension of policy flexibility should circumstances dictate.	政府已将处于创纪录高点的21.5%的强制准备金率调降了50个基点 — — 如果情况需要，中国还拥有更大的政策灵活度。
Nor has China been passive with respect to mounting speculative excesses in residential property.	中国也对房地产愈演愈烈的过度投机采取了积极的对策。
In April 2010, it implemented tough new regulations, raising down-payments from 20% to 30% for a first home, to 50% for a second residence, and to 100% for purchases of three or more units.	2010年4月，中国实施了严厉的新政，将首次置业的首付比例从20%调高至30 % ， 二次置业提高至50 % ， 三次或更多次置业更是提高至100 % 。
This strategy appears to be working.	这项政策似乎收到了效果。
In November, house prices declined in 49 of the 70 cities that China monitors monthly.	11月，中国实行月度监控的70座城市中有49座出现了房价下降。
Moreover, it is a serious exaggeration to claim, as many do today, that the Chinese economy is one massive real-estate bubble.	此外，今年很多人宣称中国经济是一个巨大的房地产泡沫，这是一种严重夸张的说法。
Yes, total fixed investment is approaching an unprecedented 50% of GDP, but residential and nonresidential real estate, combined, accounts for only 15-20% of that – no more than 10% of the overall economy.	的确，全社会固定投资已前所未有地接近国内生产总值的50 % ， 但住宅及非住宅投资合计仅占其中15－20%的份额 — — 不超过经济总量的10 % 。
In terms of floor space, residential construction accounts for half of China’s real-estate investment.	具体到楼面面积，住宅建设占据了中国房地产投资的半壁江山。
Identifying the share of residential real estate that goes to private developers in the dozen or so first-tier cities (which account for most of the Chinese property market’s fizz) suggests that less than 1% of GDP would be at risk in the event of a housing-market collapse – not exactly a recipe for a hard landing.	清理十几座一线城市（占中国房地产市场泡沫的绝大部分）私营开发商开发的住宅地产表明，如果房地产市场陷入崩溃，仅有GDP的百分之一将会受到威胁 — — 这并不会切实导致经济硬着陆。
As for Chinese banks, the main problem appears to be exposure to ballooning local-government debt, which, according to the government, totaled $1.7 trillion (roughly 30% of GDP) at the end of 2010.	至于中国的银行，主要问题似乎是地方政府债务膨胀带来的，根据政府数据，截止2010年底的地方政府债务总值达1.7万亿美元（约占GDP30%的份额 ） 。
Approximately half of this debt was on their books prior to the crisis.	大概近半数的政府债务是危机前遗留下来的。
Some of the new debt that resulted from the stimulus could well end up being impaired, but ongoing urbanization – around 15-20 million people per year move to cities – provides enormous support on the demand side for investment in infrastructure development and residential and commercial construction.	刺激政策导致的一些新增债务可能出现问题，但每年约1500－2000万人进城的持续城市化进程为基础设施开发和住宅及商业建设投资提供了需求方面的支撑。
That tempers the risks to credit quality and, along with relatively low loan-to-deposit ratios of around 65%, should cushion the Chinese banking system.	这些因素缓和了信贷质量的风险，加之65%左右的存贷比相对较低，应该可以为中国的银行系统提供必要的缓冲。
India is more problematic.	印度的问题相对严重。
As the only economy in Asia with a current-account deficit, its external funding problems can hardly be taken lightly.	作为亚洲唯一一个经常账户赤字的经济体，人们很难对它的外部融资问题掉以轻心。
Like China, India’s economic-growth momentum is ebbing.	和中国一样，印度的经济增长势头正在减弱。
But unlike China, the downshift is more pronounced – GDP growth fell through the 7% threshold in the third calendar-year quarter of 2011, and annual industrial output actually fell by 5.1% in October.	但和中国不同的是，印度的下降势头更为显著 — — 2011年第三季度GDP增速低于7%的临界点，而10月年度工业总产值实际下降了5.1 % 。
But the real problem is that, in contrast to China, Indian authorities have far less policy leeway.	但真正的问题是和中国相比，印度政府的政策回旋余地远没有那么大。
For starters, the rupee is in near free-fall.	首先，卢比几乎陷入了自由落体。
That means that the Reserve Bank of India – which has hiked its benchmark policy rate 13 times since the start of 2010 to deal with a still-serious inflation problem – can ill afford to ease monetary policy.	这意味着从2010年伊始就开始上调基准政策利率13倍以应对依然严重的通胀局面的印度储备银行很难切实放松货币政策。
Moreover, an outsize consolidated government budget deficit of around 9% of GDP limits India’s fiscal-policy discretion.	���外，政府综合大规模预算赤字占到GDP的9%左右，这严重限制了印度财政政策的自由。
While China is in better shape than India, neither economy is likely to implode on its own.	虽然中国的经济状况好于印度，但中印两国出现经济崩溃的可能性都不大。
It would take another shock to trigger a hard landing in Asia.	如果没有进一步的经济冲击，亚洲地区不太可能出现经济硬着陆。
One obvious possibility today would be a disruptive breakup of the European Monetary Union.	今天，欧洲货币联盟破坏性解体的可能性是切实存在的。
In that case, both China and India, like most of the world’s economies, could find themselves in serious difficulty – with an outright contraction of Chinese exports, as in late 2008 and early 2009, and heightened external funding pressures for India.	如果这种情况真的发生，中印两国和绝大多数世界经济体可能将面临严重的困难 — — 像2008年末及2009年初那样导致中国出口骤然减少和印度外部融资压力骤然增加。
While I remain a euro-skeptic, I believe that the political will to advance European integration will prevail.	虽然我仍对欧元持怀疑态度，但我相信推动欧洲融合的政治意愿将会占据上风。
Consequently, I attach a low probability to the currency union’s disintegration.	因此，我认为货币联盟解体的可能性不大。
Barring such a worst-case outcome for Europe, the odds of a hard landing in either India or China should remain low.	如果欧洲不出现这种最坏结果，那么印度或中国经济硬着陆的几率应该不大。
Seduced by the political economy of false prosperity, the West has squandered its might.	在政治经济虚假繁荣的引诱下，西方国家白白浪费了自己的力量。
Driven by strategy and stability, Asia has built on its newfound strength.	而在战略及稳定的驱动下，亚洲国家的力量却得到了加强。
But now it must reinvent itself.	但现在亚洲必须实现自我重塑。
Japanese-like stagnation in the developed world is challenging externally dependent Asia to shift its focus to internal demand.	发达国家出现的日本式停滞正在挑战依赖外部需求的亚洲转向依赖内部需求。
Downside pressures currently squeezing China and India underscore that challenge.	正在挤压中国和印度的下行压力凸显了这一挑战。
Asia’s defining moment could be hand.	亚洲正面临决定性的时刻。
	
Why is China Booming?	中国为什么会经历繁荣？
Providence, R.I. – China is now celebrating the 30th anniversary of the period officially known as “reform and opening.”	普罗维登斯，罗得岛 — — 中国正在庆祝被官方称之为“改革开放”的30周年纪念日。
Labeling time in this way echoes China’s imperial history.	以这种方式来标注时间映射出中国的帝国历史。
During moments of political transition – a military victory, for example – the emperor might designate a special “era name” to help celebrate the good news.	在政治转型期 — — 比如一场军事胜利 — — 皇帝也许会指定一个特殊的“年号”来帮助庆祝这个好消息。
Or the court might test out a new era name after a political debacle, in an effort to wipe the slate clean.	一次政治崩溃后，朝廷也可能会尝试使用新的年号，以便把过去所犯下的错误一笔勾销。
The last emperor of the Tang Dynasty proclaimed seven era names in fourteen years, as he sought in vain to “re-brand” his reign and avoid his regime’s demise.	唐朝最后一位皇帝在14年中公布了7个年号，徒劳无益地试图重新评价自己的统治，避免政权走向衰亡。
Deng Xiaoping began to champion “reform and opening” in 1978.	1978年，邓小平开始了“改革开放 ” 。
“Reform” suggested a loosening of central controls on economic life, undertaken in a spirit of pragmatism and gradualism, as an antidote to Mao Zedong’s ideology of “revolution.”	“改革”是指本着实事求是、按部就班的原则，放松中央对经济生活的管制，以矫正毛泽东的“革命”理念。
Similarly, “opening” heralded the PRC’s integration into the world community – especially the capitalist West.	与此相似 ， “ 开放”则预示着中华人民共和国与国际社会 — — 特别是西方资本主义社会融为一体。
Deng’s principles still guide policy today.	邓的原则直到今天还在发挥着政策指导作用。
One must go back to the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) and its 60-year era of “heavenly flourishing” ( Qianlong ) in the eighteenth century to find a comparable period of coherent political and economic policy.	必须回顾满清王朝（1644-1912）及其在18世纪长达60年的“天朝繁荣 ” （ 乾隆）才能找到与之相媲美的连贯的政治和经济政策。
The era of “reform and opening” has outlived its “emperor” by more than a decade, and has been the common thread running through transfers of political authority from Deng to Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao.	“改革开放”年代在“始作俑者”逝世后的10多年仍然生机勃勃，而且在从邓到江泽民再到胡锦涛的政治权力更替中成为一根贯穿始终的主线。
Even the largest popular challenge the Chinese Communist Party ever faced, the demonstrations of 1989, now looks like a blip that helped Deng consolidate support for his model of development.	即便是中国共产党有史以来面对的最大的民意挑战 — — 1989年游行，现在看起来也更像是帮助邓巩固对其发展模式支持的一个标记。
If one factor undergirds China’s commitment to “reform and opening,” it is the extraordinary macroeconomic changes of the past 30 years.	如果有一种因素巩固了中国“改革开放”的决心，那就是过去30年来所发生的异乎寻常的宏观经济变化。
In China, people call it fazhan , or “development,” but in much of rest of the world, it is more commonly described simply as the “China Boom,” or the “China Miracle.”	中国人把它叫做发展，也就是“development ” ， 但世界其他国家更普遍地称之为“中国繁荣 ” ， 也有人称之为“中国奇迹 ” 。
The boom began in the countryside in the late 1970’s and 1980’s, and was followed by today’s urban, industrial-led growth.	繁荣于20世纪70年代末到80年代始于乡下，随之而来的就是今天以工业为主导的城市发展。
Indeed, there have been many smaller “booms” – in consumption, foreign direct investment, domestic stock markets, trade, travel, overseas study, military modernization, and international diplomacy.	事实上，在消费、国外直接投资、国内股票市场、贸易、旅游、海外留学、军事现代化和国际外交等领域，同样经历了许多小规模的“繁荣 ” 。
There is also a boom in pollution and toxic waste, and booming interest in religion – from Buddhism to Pentecostal Christianity – and in Confucian philosophy.	污染和有毒废物排放也大为增长，同样大涨的还有人们对宗教的兴趣 — — 从佛教到基督教 — — 还有孔子的儒家哲学。
Little in China today speaks of moderation.	今天的中国很少谈及“克制”二字。
A leading fashion industry executive argues that a key engine driving the economic boom has been the influx of women into the workforce, particularly in the manufacturing zones of the south.	一位影响颇大的时尚业主管声称：驱动经济繁荣的关键因素是妇女涌入劳动大军，特别是南方的制造业领域。
Another compelling explanation comes from a venture capitalist who credits Chinese society with copious reserves of entrepreneurial energy that derives, he believes, from the fact that Chinese culture attaches very little shame to failing in a business enterprise.	另外一个有说服力的解释来自一位冒险资本家，他认为中国社会充满了创业能量的丰富储备，而在他看来，这些能量储备都源自于中国文化对创业失败几乎不加任何羞辱的事实。
High tolerance for failure keeps everybody striving to succeed.	对失败的高度包容使得所有人都为成功而拼命努力。
Whatever the cause, the boom seems an unlikely capstone to a century of war, ferment, and revolution, and only adds to the sense of discontinuity that characterizes modern China.	无论原因如何，繁荣都似乎是一个世纪战争、动乱和革命之后难以达到的顶点，因此只会加重现代中国留给人们的缺乏连贯性的印象。
Certainly, few observers looking in 1978 at the smoldering embers of the Cultural Revolution, or at the seeming ruination of the post-1989 years, thought China would emerge as the lightning rod of the world’s developmental hopes.	勿庸置疑，几乎没有研究1978年文革余烬、以及1989年后表面上看去是一片废墟的观察人士认为中国将擎起世界发展希望的火炬。
Paradoxically, the apparently discontinuous and contradictory nature of the “era of reform and opening” may actually help explain how China’s boom came about.	自相矛盾的是 ， “ 改革开放时代”看上去充满矛盾且缺乏持续性的特色实际上却有助于解释中国的繁荣从何而来。
The tumult of the Maoist period instilled in a broad cross-section of people a profound appreciation for stability, and a yearning to be left alone.	动荡的毛泽东时代使得许多人对稳定有着深刻的渴望，对自由有着异乎寻常的向往。
Deng capitalized on this revolution-weariness by diminishing the role of politics and the state in people’s private lives and freeing them to release their pent-up energy to pursue their own goals.	邓利用了人们这种厌恶革命的情绪，限制了政治和国家在人们私生活中所发挥的作用，释放了人们压抑已久的能量，鼓励他们追求自己的目标。
Revolutionary communism may well have cleared the path for the boom in other ways as well, suggesting that the shift from socialist utopianism to capitalist pragmatism was less a U-turn than a sequential process of “creative destruction.”	革命共产主义很可能也以其他的方式为繁荣铺平了道路，表明从社会乌托邦主义到资本实用主义的转变与其说是反向逆转还不如说是“扼杀创造力”的后续进程。
After all, Mao’s Cultural Revolution against “feudal society” did raze much of the cultural landscape, denuding it not only of traditional values and institutions, but also of failed socialist efforts, leaving China ready for the seeds of capitalist development.	归根结底，毛针对“封建社会”的文化大革命的确将传统文化夷为平地，不仅毁灭了传统的价值观和制度，也抹去了失败的社会努力，为资本主义发展的种子播撒进中国这片沃土做好了准备。
Mao’s revolution fueled countless rectification movements and campaigns that inverted the once-inviolate primacy of ruler over ruled, scholar over worker, husband over wife, father over son, and family over individual.	毛的革命催生了无数修正运动，逆转了从前从未受到过侵犯的统治者对被统治者、学者对工人、丈夫对妻子、父亲对儿子和家庭对个人的主导地位。
By the time of the reforms of the 1980’s and 1990’s, bonds tying individuals to culture, the state, the work unit, and household-registration systems, for example, had largely unraveled.	到20世纪八九十年代改革之时，将个人捆绑在文化、国家、单位和户口登记制度上的束缚在很大程度上已经不复存在。
The path had been cleared for a vast new population of atomized entrepreneurs and laborers, freed from fealty to family and Party, to storm the marketplace with newly liberated individual energy.	摆在大量新增个人企业主和劳工面前的障碍已经扫清，摆脱了家庭和政党责任的束缚，中国民众以刚刚解放出来的个人力量横扫市场。
Of course, the boom’s costs should not be discounted.	当然，繁荣所付出的代价也不能忽略不计。
Environmental damage has been staggering, the gap between rich and poor has been growing, and urbanization – with all its attendant problems – has surged.	对环境的损害一直如影随形，富人和穷人之间的差距也越拉越大，而与城市化相伴而生的问题 — — 也变得日益严重。
And, at least so far, the boom has not induced the systemic political changes for which many hoped.	而且，至少到目前为止，繁荣还未能带来许多人所期盼的系统性政治变革。
But still, a key question remains unanswered: why did China’s boom happen?	即便如此，一个关键性的问题仍然需要解答：那就是为什么会出现中国的繁荣？
This is one of the great questions of our time, relevant not only to China’s future, but to scores of other developing countries enthralled by China’s extraordinary, but still largely unexplained, success.	这是我们这个时代的一个伟大的疑问，它不仅关系到中国的未来，而且也关系到为中国异乎寻常、但仍然在很大程度上难以解释的成功所着迷的几十个发展中国家的未来。
	
Why is China Lashing Out?	中国为何发飙？
NEW YORK – It must be galling for the Chinese government to keep seeing Nobel Prizes go to the wrong Chinese.	发自纽约 - - -眼看着诺贝尔奖一次次落入错误的中国人之手，中国政府一定感到怒不可遏吧。
The first wrong Chinese was Gao Xingjian, a critical playwright, artist, and novelist, who received the Nobel Prize for literature in 2000, while living in exile in Paris.	翻开诺贝尔奖的历史，第一位获奖的错误中国人是著名剧作家，艺术家和小说家高行健，他在2000年获得了诺贝尔文学奖，当时他正在巴黎过着流亡的日子。
The latest is Liu Xiaobo, a literary critic and political writer, who was awarded this year’s Nobel Prize for Peace while serving a prison sentence for “subversion” of the Communist regime.	最近的一位则是政治评论家和作家刘晓波，他是今年的和平奖得主，因被判“颠覆”国家政权罪而身陷牢狱。
Since the Dalai Lama is not a Chinese citizen, I will leave out his Nobel Peace Prize, though to China’s rulers it was perhaps the most irritating of all.	鉴于达赖喇嘛不是中国公民，尽管他的得奖是最让中国政府不可容忍的，但我还是没有把他计算在内。
Yet the Chinese government’s response to Liu’s Nobel Prize has been extraordinary.	不过，对刘晓波的获奖，中国政府这回的反应还是有点不同寻常。
Instead of a show of lofty disdain, or official silence, it made a colossal fuss, protesting fiercely about plots to undermine China, and putting dozens of prominent Chinese intellectuals, including Liu’s wife, Liu Xia, under house arrest.	有别于以往蔑视或保持官方沉默的态度，它这回显得极度震惊，强烈抗议这一破坏中国的阴谋，并悍然软禁了数十名国内著名知识分子，其中包括刘晓波的妻子刘霞。
As a result, the utterly powerless, hitherto quite obscure Liu Xiaobo, has become not only world famous, but much better known inside China, too.	结果名不经传又没什么影响力的刘晓波不仅蜚声国际，也为中国国内所家喻户晓了。
Combine this with China’s bullying of Japan, by blocking the export of rare-earth metals vital for Japanese industry, over a few uninhabited islands between Taiwan and Okinawa, and its refusal to let the renminbi appreciate, and one must wonder why China is being so heavy-handed in its foreign relations.	把这件事与在台湾和冲绳之间几个无人小岛的主权问题上以禁止作为日本工业命脉的稀土出口来要挟日本，以及拒绝人民币升值等事件放在一起来看，人们一定会疑惑中国为什么突然采取如此笨拙的外交手段。
These strong-arm tactics stand out even more against the deftness of Chinese diplomacy over the last few decades.	这种铁腕策略明显地违背了中国在过去几十年里一直坚守的灵活外交。
Japan, the old wartime enemy, has been outmaneuvered repeatedly, and a soft touch made South Koreans and Southeast Asians feel relatively comfortable with China’s increasing power.	正是凭借这种灵活的外交手法，中国才使得日本这个战争年代的对手一直处于外交下风，也让韩国和东南亚各国接受了其崛起。
But China’s recent thuggish behavior is changing Asian opinions.	但是，中国现在这种来势汹汹的态度正引起亚洲的警觉。
As the warm welcome given to Hillary Clinton on her recent swing through Asia – even in communist Vietnam – appears to show, Southeast Asians are more than happy to hang on to Pax Americana for a bit longer, out of fear of China.	正如希拉里新近在亚洲（甚至在越南）巡回访问所受到的热烈欢迎所显示，出于对中国崛起的恐惧，东南亚乐于在美国治下的和平待久一点。
Other Asian countries might even be drawn closer to Japan, the only alternative to the US as a counterbalance to the Middle Kingdom.	其他亚洲国家则只能别无选择地更亲近日本，因为它是除美国之外唯一能与中土王朝抗衡的国家。
This cannot be what China wants.	这些当然都不是中国所愿看到的。
So why is China being so severe?	至此，我们不禁要问，为什么中国要如此强势？
One possible explanation is that China is a little drunk on its new great-power status.	一种解释是中国面对其新获得的大国地位有点昏了头。
For the first time in almost 200 years, China can really throw its weight around, and it will do what it wants, regardless of what other countries may think.	在差不多200多年的时间里，中国第一次尝到能够真正地展现它影响力的甜头，它将无视他国的看法而为所欲为。
A few decades ago, it was Japan that thought it was going to be Number One, and its businessmen, politicians, and bureaucrats were not shy about letting the rest of the world know.	几十年前，那时的日本也认为自己是世界第一，它的商人，政治家和官员也禁不住向世界各国耀武扬威。
Call China’s recent actions revenge for a century of humiliation by stronger powers.	同理，我们也可以把中国最近的蛮横看作是用强权对百年屈辱的报复。
But this may not be the best explanation for China’s behavior.	不过，我觉得这不是对中国最近行为最好的解释。
In fact, the reason may be just the opposite: a sense among China’s rulers of weakness at home.	事实上，真正的原因可能正好是这个解释的反面：中国统治者感到在国内统治的衰弱。
At least since 1989, the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party’s monopoly on power has been fragile.	至少从1989年开始，中国共产党独裁的合法性就已经变得很脆弱了。
Communist ideology is a spent force.	共产主义意识形态已是明日黄花。
Using the People’s Liberation Army to murder civilian protesters, not only in Beijing, but all over China in June 1989, further undermined the one-party system’s legitimacy.	1989年6月，人民解放军在北京及去全国各地残杀异见人士的恶劣行径进一步削弱了一党专制的基础。
The way to regain the support of the burgeoning Chinese middle class was to promise a quick leap to greater prosperity through high-speed economic growth.	为了挽回新兴中产阶级的支持，共产党许诺将通过高速经济发展向集体富裕大步迈进。
The ideological vacuum left by the death of Marxist orthodoxy was filled with nationalism.	由于对马克思主义信仰的幻灭而带来的意识形态真空被民族主义所填补。
And nationalism in China, promoted through schools, mass media, and “patriotic” monuments and museums, means one thing: only the firm rule of the CCP will prevent foreigners, especially Westerners and the Japanese, from humiliating Chinese ever again.	而中国通过学校，大众媒体以及“爱国”纪念碑和博物馆所宣扬的民族主义，其核心只有一条：只有在中国共产的领导下，才能避免外国，特别是西方和日本，羞辱中国的历史重演。
This is why anyone, even a relatively unknown intellectual like Liu Xiaobo, who challenges the legitimacy of Communist Party rule by demanding multi-party elections, must be crushed.	这就是为什么任何挑战共产党统治的合法性，提倡多党制的人，即便如刘晓波这样鲜为人知的学者，都必须被打倒。
It is why the government does not dare to let the renminbi appreciate too fast, lest economic growth slow, causing the Party loses face and legitimacy.	这也是为什么中国政府不敢让人民币升值太快的原因，避免经济衰退，导致共产党没面子和丧失统治地位。
And it is why bullying Japan is always a good option: China’s rulers do not necessarily hate Japan, but they are afraid to look weak in the eyes of their citizens, who are taught from kindergarten that foreign powers want to humiliate China.	这也是为什么欺负日本总是外交手段的一个好选择：中国的统治者不一定恨日本，但他们不能接受被国人视为软弱无能，因为国人从小就被教导国外势力都企图欺负中国。
This suggests that if Liu Xiaobo and like-minded dissidents ever got their wish, and democracy came to China, the problem of Chinese nationalism would not go away.	这就意味着，即便刘晓波和类似的异见人士得偿所愿，民主真的降临中国，但中国民族主义的问题仍将如影随形地存在。
After all, if the people feel persecuted by Japan or the United States, then the people will demand chauvinistic policies.	毕竟，如果人们感到遭受了日本或美国的迫害，那么他们就会强烈要求国家采取大国沙文主义政策。
Democracy has not tempered South Korean chauvinism much, either, since the demise of the military dictatorship in the 1980’s.	20世纪80年代，虽然韩国推翻了国内的军事独裁，但民主并没有缓和其沙文主义政策。
But nationalism may not be a political constant.	不过，民族主义不是一个政治常态。
Nationalism is often fed by a sense of impotence.	民族主义通常都由软弱无力的感受所激发。
When citizens feel disempowered by an authoritarian government, the next best thing is to feel empowered by national prowess.	当公民感到被权威政府剥夺了权利时，为避免民族主义抬头，接下来最好还是让他们为国家强大的实力而自豪。
In a multi-party democracy, on the other hand, citizens are concerned with other interests, material, social, even cultural ones, and thus less likely to be drawn into aggressive chauvinism.	另一方面，在一个多党制民主国家里，民众可以选择关注其他别的利益，物质的，社会的，甚或是文化的，因此很少会投入侵略性的沙文主义怀抱之中。
Or so we must hope.	或者说，我们希望是这样的。
The state of many democracies today is not the best advertisement for political freedom. But the Chinese should have the right to decide about that themselves.	尽管当今世界许多民主国家的情况并不能最好地体现政治自由的好处，但中国人应该有选择的权利。
And Liu Xiaobo should be honored for saying so.	从这个角度讲，刘晓波获得诺奖，当之无愧。
	
Why is France Burning?	法国为何在燃烧？
The urban disturbances in France have been called the most severe since the riots by students and workers in 1968.	法国的城市骚乱被称为1968年学潮和工潮以来最为严重的事件。
The analogy is misleading.	这个比喻是不恰当的。
While the 1968 protests challenged the French Republican model to live up to its finest aspirations, today’s crisis challenges the French Revolution’s model of citizenship and integration itself.	1968年的抗议要求法兰西共和国实现其最高的理想，而今天的危机则挑战法国大革命的公民资格和融入模式本身。
The French Republican model asserts that all French citizens have the same cultural identity.	法兰西共和国模式宣扬所有的法国公民都有相同的文化特征。
Indeed, this is the only acceptable identity.	实际上，这是唯一可以接受的特征。
To achieve this shared identity, all citizens have to speak the one official language and be educated according to a common curriculum.	为了实现这一共同特征，所有的公民都必须讲唯一的官方语言并按照相同的课程接受教育。
But they also enjoy equal rights, and have the same duties, in the public arena.	但是在公共场合，他们也享有平等的权利和同样的义务。
All this is not only fostered by the state, but also requires the kind of uniformity that only a centralized state can impose.	这一切不仅由国家予以扶持，而且要求一种只有中央集权国家才能施行的统一。
Indeed, the French Revolution’s ideological commitment to unity was so strong that during parts of the nineteenth century, advocating federalism was a capital offense.	实际上，法国大革命对于团结的意识形态上的承诺十分严肃，以致于在十九世纪的某些时候，鼓吹联邦主义是死罪。
Three components of this model incited today’s crisis and make it difficult for the French Republic to address it effectively.	这一模式的三个要素引发了今天的危机，并且使得法兰西共和国难以有效地加以解决。
The first component is the classic French Republican prohibition on gathering data in the official census – or by government agencies or public or private enterprises – on ethnicity, religion, and even social class.	第一个要素是，法兰西共和国素来禁止在官方人口普查中，或者由政府机构或私营企业收集有关种族、宗教甚至是社会阶层的数据。
Collecting these data would, it is argued, violate the Republican tenet that France is “one and indivisible.”	法国认为，收集这些数据会违反共和国的信条，也就是，法兰西是“统一不可分割的 ” 。
But the absence of a secondary breakdown of such data, like the UK-style, four-fold class analysis (plus examination of patterns of unemployment by ethnicity or religion), makes it hard for social workers, public heath officials, and economic planners to diagnose new problems.	但是，如果没有像英国模式那样对此类数据进行第二层分析以及四层社会阶层分析（加上按照种族或宗教区分进行的失业模式分析 ） ， 使得社会工作者、政府卫生官员以及经济规划者很难诊断新的问题。
Without the necessary data for analysis, public health policies, for example, cannot be directed toward groups that are especially disadvantaged or otherwise at risk.	举例说，没有进行分析所必要的数据，就难以针对特别弱势或有危险的群体制定公共卫生政策。
The second factor is the classic French Republican rejection of, and legal norms against, any form of “affirmative action,” or positive discrimination, even of the most inoffensive kind.	第二个因素是，法兰西共和国一向拒绝任何形式的、哪怕是最无伤害的“肯定行动”或积极性区别对待，并且在法律上予以禁止。
Like the prohibition of fine-tuned data – without which positive discrimination is in any case impossible – affirmative action is seen as damaging to the Republican model because it is based on recognition of ethnic differences.	没有对数据的精确分析就不可能有积极性区别对待。 肯定行动和精确分析一样基于承认种族区别而被视为有害于共和国模式。
The third component is the post-welfare state, which is now part of the French model of citizenship and guarantees all full-time employees one of the highest minimum wages in the world and high employer-paid benefits.	第三个因素是后福利国家。 这是法国公民资格模式的一部分，并且保证给所有全职雇员全世界最高的最低工资和很高的雇主支付的福利。
This makes it extremely difficult to let workers go, which makes employers reluctant to hire new people in the first place.	这样就很难解雇工人，而且使得雇主不愿意招募新的雇员。
Many of the social-democratic countries of Europe, like Sweden, Holland, and Denmark, created similar norms in their full-employment eras.	瑞典、荷兰和丹麦等众多欧洲社会民主主义国家在它们全面就业时期建立了类似的规定。
Unlike France, however, they also used census data to identify pockets of new unemployment, and to invest socially and politically, not only in excellent job-training programs, but in job creation, and, just as importantly, in job-placement schemes.	但是，和法国不同的是，它们也使用人口普查数据来确定新的失业人口的经济状况，在社会福利和政治上不仅建立良好的职业培训项目，而且也创造就业机会，同时更为重要的是，建立职业介绍规划。
France is now very bad at creating new jobs.	法国目前在创造就业机会上无所作为。
It has few training programs, but high benefits for the unemployed and strong restrictions against firing workers.	基本上没有培训项目，而失业福利很高，解雇限制重重。
Put all of this together, and it is like slamming a door in the face of young minority men looking for work.	凡此种种，就如同在找工作的少数族裔年轻人面前关上大门一样。
This is the primary cause of the 30-50% unemployment rates among minorities aged 16-24 in many French “urban zones of sensitivity.”	法国的许多“敏感城市地带”中16岁至24岁少数族裔人口失业率达到30％到50 ％ ， 这是首要原因。
Thus, the riots that France is now seeing emerge from French policies, not from instigations by Islamists.	因此，法国现在看到的骚乱源于法国的政策，而不是穆斯林煽动。
France has simply failed to incorporate minority citizens – many of them third-generation immigrants who have been educated for twenty years in assimilationist public schools.	法国根本上没有融合少数族裔公民，他们中的许多人都是第三代移民，在同化主义的公共学校中接受了二十年的教育。
But few political leaders accept that the crisis has anything to do with the French model of citizenship.	但是，很少有政治领导人承认这场危机和法国的公民资格模式有关。
Indeed, they confidently wait for assimilation to kick in.	实际上，他们都充满信心，等待同化奏效。
But in today’s high unemployment, low job-creation, and now multicultural France, assimilation will not occur without big changes.	但是，在当今高失业率、低就业机会以及多元文化的法国，没有巨大的变革就不会有同化。
France is only now beginning to come to grips with the crisis of its Republican model of equal citizenship.	法国目前刚刚开始应付共和国平等公民资格模式的危机。
A newly created Minister of Social Cohesion has begun to commission studies documenting discrimination.	新近成立的社会凝聚部已经开始委托进行有关歧视的研究。
One study showed that for similarly qualified job applicants, those with an Islamic-sounding name, and an address in an ethnically segmented suburb, had only one-fifth the chance of even getting an interview as people with a French-sounding name and a “safe” address.	其中一项研究发现，对于大体同样合格的求职者，那些听起来像伊斯兰的名字和种族分离郊区的地址的人得到哪怕是面试的机会只有那些听起来像法国人的名字和“安全的”地址的人的五分之一。
Two hundred and fifty of the largest private and public enterprises have created an organization aimed at working with the government to allow them, for the first time ever, to document, and then redress, their discriminatory employment practices.	二百五十家最大的私营和公营企业建立了一个组织，旨在和政府合作让它们第一次记述歧视性的雇用做法并加以矫正。
Fortunately, organized Muslim leaders so far have not aggravated the rioting.	所幸的是，有组织的穆斯林领导人目前为止并没有加重骚乱。
Of course, the government’s reduction of community policing in favor of paramilitary forces stationed in quasi-military barracks, and the Minister of Interior’s description of the young rioters as “scum” who should be washed away with an industrial power hose, has not helped.	当然，政府减少社区警力而将半军事化部队驻扎在半军事化营房内、内政部长将年轻的骚乱份子称为应当用强力工业水笼冲刷掉的“人渣”则于事无补。
The French Republican model enshrines the laudable abstract principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity.	法兰西共和国崇仰值得称赞的、���象的自由、平等和博爱的原则。
However, so long as second- and third-generation minority citizens are taught that the only acceptable cultural identity is French, but are not in fact accepted as French – indeed, are blocked from enjoying the full rights of French citizenship – the Republican model will fuel alienation rather than democratic integration.	但是，只要第二和第三代少数裔公民被教化说唯一可以接受的文化特征是法国式的，而实际上并不被接纳为法国人，却无法享受作为法国公民所理应享受的完整的权利，那么，这一共和国模式将会激起分离，而非民主化融合。
	
Why ISIS Persists	为何ISIS能持久存在
NEW YORK – Deadly terrorist attacks in Istanbul, Dhaka, and Baghdad demonstrate the murderous reach of the Islamic State (ISIS) in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.	纽约—伊斯坦布尔、达卡和巴格达的致命恐怖袭击表明伊斯兰国（ISIS）的魔爪已经触及欧洲、北非、中东和亚洲多部。
The longer ISIS maintains its strongholds in Syria and Iraq, the longer its terrorist network will create such carnage.	ISIS在叙利亚和伊拉克保持强势越久，其恐怖网络炮制此类大屠杀的日子也越久。
Yet ISIS is not especially difficult to defeat.	但ISIS并不特别难以根除。
The problem is that none of the states involved in Iraq and Syria, including the United States and its allies, has so far treated ISIS as its primary foe.	问题在于牵涉伊拉克和叙利亚的各国，包括美国及其盟国，都没有将ISIS作为主要敌人。
It’s time they do.	这一点应该改变了。
ISIS has a small fighting force, which the US puts at 20,000 to 25,000 in Iraq and Syria, and another 5,000 or so in Libya.	ISIS有一支小规模战斗力量，美国预测其在伊拉克和叙利亚有20,000到25,000人，在利比亚还有5,000人左右。
Compared to the number of active military personnel in Syria (125,000), Iraq (271,500), Saudi Arabia (233,500), Turkey (510,600), or Iran (523,000), ISIS is minuscule.	与叙利亚（125,000 ） 、 伊拉克（271,500 ） 、 沙特阿拉伯（233,500 ） 、 土耳其（510,600）和伊朗（523,000）现役军队人数相比，ISIS根本不值一提。
Despite US President Barack Obama’s pledge in September 2014 to “degrade and ultimately destroy” ISIS, the US and its allies, including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Israel (behind the scenes), have been focusing instead on toppling Syria’s Bashar al-Assad.	2014年9月，美国总统奥巴马承诺“打击并最终消灭”ISIS，但美国及其盟国，包括沙特阿拉伯、土耳其和以色列（在幕后 ） ， 一直专注于颠覆叙利亚的巴沙尔·阿萨德。
Consider a recent candid statement by Israeli Major General Herzi Halevy (quoted to me by a journalist who attended the speech where Halevy made it): “Israel does not want to see the situation in Syria end with [ISIS] defeated, the superpowers gone from the region, and [Israel] left with a Hezbollah and Iran that have greater capabilities.”	最近，以色列陆军少将赫尔齐·哈勒威（Herzi Halevy）直言不讳地声称（由一位哈勒威讲话现场的记者向我转述 ） ： “以色列不想看到叙利亚局势以（ISIS）被击败、超级大国退出该地区 、 （ 以色列）面对实力更强的真主党和伊朗结束 。 ”
Israel opposes ISIS, but Israel’s greater concern is Assad’s Iranian backing.	以色列反对ISIS，但以色列更大的担忧是阿萨德背后的伊朗。
Assad enables Iran to support two paramilitary foes of Israel, Hezbollah and Hamas.	阿萨德让伊朗得以支持以色列的两大准军事对手 — — 真主党和哈马斯。
Israel therefore prioritizes the removal of Assad over the defeat of ISIS.	因此，以色列的重点是推翻阿萨德，而不是击败ISIS。
For the US, steered by neoconservatives, the war in Syria is a continuation of the plan for global US hegemony launched by Defense Secretary Richard Cheney and Under Secretary Paul Wolfowitz at the Cold War’s end.	受新保守主义影响，对美国来说，叙利亚战争是国防部长切尼（Richard Cheney）和副国务卿保罗·沃尔福威茨（Paul Wolfowitz）在冷战结束时所提出的全球美国霸权计划的延续。
In 1991, Wolfowitz told US General Wesley Clark:	1991年，沃尔福威茨对美国将军韦斯利·克拉克（Wesley Clark）说：
“But one thing we did learn [from the Persian Gulf War] is that we can use our military in the region – in the Middle East – and the Soviets won’t stop us.	“但我们（从海湾战争中）确实学到了一件事，那就是我们可以在该地区 — — 在中东 — — 使用武力，而苏联人不会阻止我们。
And we’ve got about 5 or 10 years to clean up those old Soviet regimes – Syria, Iran (sic), Iraq – before the next great superpower comes on to challenge us.”	在下一个超级大国出现挑战我们之前，我们有大约5到10年时间清理旧苏联政权 — — 叙利亚、伊朗（原文如此 ） 、 伊拉克 。 ”
The multiple US wars in the Middle East – Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and others – have sought to remove the Soviet Union, and then Russia, from the scene and to give the US hegemonic sway.	美国在中东的多场战争 — — 阿富汗、伊拉克、叙利亚、利比亚，等等 — — 是为了让苏联以及随后的俄罗斯退出竞争，让美国独树霸权。
These efforts have failed miserably.	这些“努力”遭到了惨败。
For Saudi Arabia, as for Israel, the main goal is to oust Assad in order to weaken Iran.	对沙特阿拉伯，以及对以色列来说，主要目标是颠覆阿萨德以削弱伊朗。
Syria is part of the extensive proxy war between Shia Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia that plays out in the battlefields of Syria and Yemen and in bitter Shia-Sunni confrontations in Bahrain and other divided countries in the region (including Saudi Arabia itself).	叙利亚是什叶派伊朗和逊尼派沙特阿拉伯之间规模浩大的代理战争的一部分，这场战争在叙利亚和也门等��场展开，也在巴林和其他该地区有分裂倾向的国家（包括沙特阿拉伯本身）更加激烈的什叶派-逊尼派对峙前沿展开。
For Turkey, the overthrow of Assad would bolster its regional standing.	对土耳其来说，推翻阿萨德将加强它的地区地位。
Yet Turkey now faces three foes on its southern border: Assad, ISIS, and nationalist Kurds.	但土耳其现在在其南部边境面临三个对手：阿萨德、ISIS以及民族主义库尔德人。
ISIS has so far taken a back seat to Turkey’s concerns about Assad and the Kurds.	到目前为止，ISIS对土耳其来说不如阿萨德和库尔德人重要。
But ISIS-directed terrorist attacks in Turkey may be changing that.	但ISIS炮制的土耳其恐怖袭击可能改变这一局面。
Russia and Iran, too, have pursued their own regional interests, including through proxy wars and support for paramilitary operations.	俄罗斯和伊朗也追求自身的地区利益，通过代理战争和支持准军事行动实现。
Yet both have signaled their readiness to cooperate with the US to defeat ISIS, and perhaps to solve other problems as well.	但两国都表态准备与美国合作打击ISIS，并且可以在解决其他问题方面也进行合作。
The US has so far spurned these offers, because of its focus on toppling Assad.	到目前为止，美国一直无动于衷，因为它的关注点是颠覆阿萨德。
The US foreign-policy establishment blames Russian President Vladimir Putin for defending Assad, while Russia blames the US for trying to overthrow him.	美国外交政策界谴责俄罗斯总统普京袒护阿萨德，而俄罗斯谴责美国试图推翻阿萨德。
These complaints might seem symmetrical, but they’re not.	这些抱怨看上去针锋相对，实则不然。
The attempt by the US and its allies to overthrow Assad violates the UN Charter, while Russia’s support of Assad is consistent with Syria’s right of self-defense under that charter.	美国及其盟国颠覆阿萨德的尝试违反了联合国宪章，而俄罗斯支持阿萨德符合宪章规定的叙利亚的自卫权。
Yes, Assad is a despot, but the UN Charter does not give license to any country to choose which despots to depose.	诚然，阿萨德是一位暴君，但联合国宪章并没有授予任何国家选择推翻哪位暴君的权力。
The persistence of ISIS underscores three strategic flaws in US foreign policy, along with a fatal tactical flaw.	ISIS的持久存在彰显出美国外交政策的三大战略缺陷，以及一个致命战术缺陷。
First, the neocon quest for US hegemony through regime change is not only bloody-minded arrogance; it is classic imperial overreach.	首先，新保守主义要求通过颠覆政权实现美国霸权不但是血腥思维的无知；更是经典的帝国主义不自量力。
It has failed everywhere the US has tried it.	凡是美国如此尝试的地方，无一不以失败告终。
Syria and Libya are the latest examples.	叙利亚和利比亚是最新的例子。
Second, the CIA has long armed and trained Sunni jihadists through covert operations funded by Saudi Arabia.	其次，中央情报局长期以来通过沙特阿拉伯出资的秘密行动武装和培训逊尼派圣战者。
In turn, these jihadists gave birth to ISIS, which is a direct, if unanticipated, consequence of the policies pursued by the CIA and its Saudi partners.	反过来，这些圣战者催生了ISIS，这是中央情报局及其沙特合作者所追求的政策的同一个直接（或许是意料外的）后果。
Third, the US perception of Iran and Russia as implacable foes of America is in many ways outdated and a self-fulfilling prophecy.	第三，美国将伊朗和俄罗斯视为美国不可和解的敌人在很大程度上是一个自我实现的过时预言。
A rapprochement with both countries is possible.	与两国重塑关系是可能的。
Fourth, on the tactical side, the US attempt to fight a two-front war against both Assad and ISIS has failed.	第四，在战术层面，美国试图打赢对阿萨德和ISIS的双线战争已经失败。
Whenever Assad has been weakened, Sunni jihadists, including ISIS and al-Nusra Front, have filled the vacuum.	凡是阿萨德被削弱时候，逊尼派圣战者，包括ISIS和努斯拉阵线（al-Nusira Front）就会填补真空。
Assad and his Iraqi counterparts can defeat ISIS if the US, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Iran provide air cover and logistical support.	如果美国、俄罗斯、沙特阿拉伯和伊朗提供空中掩护和物流支持，阿萨德及其伊拉克同道能够击败ISIS。
Yes, Assad would remain in power; yes, Russia would retain an ally in Syria; and yes, Iran would have influence there.	诚然，阿萨德将继续掌权；诚然，俄罗斯将继续是叙利亚的盟国；诚然，伊朗将在那里获得影响力。
Terrorist attacks would no doubt continue, perhaps even in the name of ISIS for a while; but the group would be denied its base of operations in Syria and Iraq.	恐怖袭击毫无疑问将继续存在，也许在一段时间里仍将打着ISIS的旗号；但该组织将被驱逐出其在叙利亚和伊拉克的行动基地。
Such an outcome would not only end ISIS on the ground in the Middle East; it could lay the groundwork for reducing regional tensions more generally.	这一结果不但可以在中东大地上根除ISIS；还能为更加全面地缓解地区紧张打下基础。
The US and Russia could begin to reverse their recent new cold war through shared efforts to stamp out jihadist terrorism.	美国和俄罗斯可以通过共同驱逐圣战恐怖主义开始扭转最近的新冷战。
(A pledge that NATO will not offer admission to Ukraine or escalate missile defenses in Eastern Europe would also help.)	（北约承诺不让乌克兰入盟或不升级东欧弹道导弹防御也能有所裨益。 ）
There’s more.	还有其他好处。
A cooperative approach to defeating ISIS would give Saudi Arabia and Turkey reason and opportunity to find a new modus vivendi with Iran.	采取合作方针打击ISIS将给沙特阿拉伯和土耳其理由和机会寻找与伊朗的新权宜之计。
Israel’s security could be enhanced by bringing Iran into a cooperative economic and geopolitical relationship with the West, in turn enhancing the chances for a long-overdue two-state settlement with Palestine.	以色列的安全可以通过让伊朗构建与西方的合作性经济和地缘政治关系、反过来增加一拖再拖的以巴两国和解的机会而得到强化。
The rise of ISIS is a symptom of the shortcomings of current Western – particularly US – strategy.	ISIS的崛起是当前西方 — — 尤其是美国 — — 战略缺陷的表征。
The West can defeat ISIS.	西方能够击败ISIS。
The question is whether the US will undertake the strategic reassessment needed to accomplish that end.	问题在于美国是否会进行实现这一目标所需要的战略重估。
	
Why Is Physics Beautiful?	物理学为何是美？
CAMBRIDGE – The nineteenth-century physicist Heinrich Hertz once described his feeling that James Clerk Maxwell’s equations, which depict the fundamentals of electricity and magnetism, “have an independent existence and an intelligence of their own, that they are wiser…even than their discoverers, that we get more out of them than was originally put into them.”	纽约剑桥—十九世纪物理学家赫兹曾经描述道，他觉得构成电磁学基础的麦克斯韦方程组“拥有独立存在和自己的智能，它们甚至比其他发现者 … … 都跟聪明，我们从它们身上得到的比我们最初投入它们身上的更多 。 ”
Not long after, Albert Einstein called Niels Bohr’s atomic model “the highest form of musicality in the sphere of thought.”	此后不久，爱因斯坦将玻尔的原子模型称为“思想界最高的音乐形式 。 ”
More recently, the late Nobel laureate Richard Feynman, describing his discovery of new laws of physics, declared, “You can recognize truth by its beauty and simplicity.”	更晚近一些，已故诺贝尔物理学奖获得者费曼这样描述他所发现的物理学新定律 ： “ 你可以从它的美和简单中认识真理 。 ”
Similar sentiments are all but universal among modern physicists.	类似的感觉在现代物理学家中间无处不在。
Wishful thinking could never produce working iPhones, photographs of Pluto, or atomic bombs.	想当然永远无法创造出能用的iPhone、冥王星照片和原子弹。
Physics, as summarized in a handful of mathematically precise laws, indisputably works.	被总结为一小撮数学上精确的定律的物理学毫无争议是有效的。
Yet many things that “work” do not inspire the kind of admiration that the fundamental laws of nature do.	但许多“有效”的东西并没有激起类似于对自然基本定律的崇拜的情感。
Their beauty is rooted, first, in the laws’ symmetry, here meaning the possibility of change without change – a precise yet almost mystical concept.	物理学定律的美首先植根于它们的对称性（symmetry ） — —这里意味着不变之变的可能性 — — 一个精确的，但几乎是神秘的概念。
Just as a circle can be rotated about its center at any angle, changing the position of each of its points without changing its form, symmetric laws apply to changed situations without changing or losing validity.	正如圆可以绕其圆心旋转任意角度，让圆上所有的点改变位置而不改变圆本身的形状，对称定律适用于变化的情况而不必作出变化或失去有效性。
For example, special relativity asserts that the fundamental laws of physics remain the same when we view the world from a platform moving at constant velocity.	比如，狭义相对论认为，当我们从匀速运动的平台看世界时，物理学基本定律不会发生改变。
Similarly, so-called time translation symmetry encodes the uniformity of physical law in time: Even as the universe ages, the laws remain the same.	类似地，所谓的时间平移对称性描述了物理学定律在时间上的一致性：就算天荒地老，定律依然不变。
The second source of beauty in the laws of physics is their productivity – what I call their exuberance.	物理学定律之美的第二个来源是其生产力（productivity ） — —我称之为繁茂（exuberance ） 。
Just a handful of basic principles generates an astonishing wealth of consequences – everything in the physical world!	少数几个基本原理就能衍生出令人震惊的大量结果 — — 物理学世界的一切！
You can write the equations of the core theories of physics – known as the standard model – quite comfortably on a T-shirt.	你可以轻松地在一件T恤衫上写下物理学核心理论的方程组 — — 所谓的标准模型。
To paraphrase Hertz, they give back far more than we put in.	用赫兹的话说，它们给我们的东西比我们投入它们的东西更多。
It is important to note that the laws of physics need not necessarily have such marvelous properties.	物理学定律不一定具有如此非凡的性质，认识到这一点很重要。
Consider this hypothetical situation: Developments in computer power, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence enable the creation of self-aware beings whose “world” is, from our perspective, a programmed simulation.	考虑以下假想情形：计算机能力、虚拟现实和人工智能的发展让我们得以创造出一种有自我意识的物种，它们的“世界”在我们看来是一种编程仿真。
If a self-aware Super Mario began to analyze the laws of his world, he would find very little symmetry or productivity.	如果有自我意识的超级马里奥开始分析他的世界的定律，他不会发现多少对称性和生产力。
Instead, he would find a vast collection of loosely connected, quirky rules, reflecting the whims of the programmer.	相反，我们会发现大量联系松散的古怪规则，它们反映出编程者的奇思妙想。
The beauty of physical law is too impressive to be accidental.	物理定律之美实在太炫目，它不可能是偶然的。
It has led people throughout history to believe that some tasteful higher being created us, and that we inhabit a consciously designed world, like our notional Super Mario.	这让历史上的人们相信，是一些情趣高雅的高等生物创造了我们，我们定居在一个刻意设计的世界中，就像我们的抽象的超级马里奥。
But this is an extravagant hypothesis, which goes far beyond the facts it is meant to explain.	但这是一个夸张的假说，远远超过了它意在解释的事实。
Before adopting it, we should explore more economical alternatives.	在接受它以前，我们应该考察一下，更划算的替代方案。
The answer likely lies within us.	答案可能在我们中间。
Beautiful things are those in which we find pleasure and seek out.	美丽的东西是我们可以从中找到并获得愉悦的东西。
They are, in neurobiological terms, things that stimulate our reward system.	用神经生物学的术语讲，它们是刺激我们的犒赏系统的东西。
That explains why parents tend to find their young children beautiful, and adults are attracted to nubile models and their images.	这解释了为何父母亲总是认为他们的小孩很美，成年人总是被性感模特和他们的照片吸引。
It makes evolutionary sense to reward such feelings.	犒赏这些感觉具有进化意义。
The evolutionary utility of the beauty of physical laws is somewhat less obvious, but no less real.	物理学之美的进化效用也许不那么明显，但也是实实在在的。
Given the usefulness of accurately assessing the consequences of our actions, our reward system has evolved so that we derive joy from making successful predictions.	准确评估我们的行为的后果十分有用，因此，我们的犒赏系统进化出一种能力，让我们从做出成功的预测中感到乐趣。
Understanding the forces and patterns defining our world, and especially principles that apply (without changing) to a wide variety of situations, can help to improve our predictions.	理解决定我们的世界的力量和模式，特别是（无需变化）适用于各种情况的原理，有助于改善我们的预测。
The fact that we can often infer the behavior of complex objects or systems from knowledge of their parts – that we get back more than we put in – can help us to hone our predictions further.	我们常常可以从关于复杂对象或系统的某些部分的知识中推断它们的行为 — — 获得比我们的投入更多的东西 — — 这一事实有助于我们进一步精炼我们的预测。
In short, because evolution predisposes us to find beautiful those things that help us understand the world correctly, it is no accident that we find the correct laws of nature beautiful.	简言之，由于进化让我们倾向于认为有助于我们正确理解世界的东西是美丽的，因此，我们发现自然定律之美并非偶然。
Viewed from this perspective, the apparent beauty of the laws of physics – our attraction to their symmetry and exuberance – is not surprising.	从这个角度看，物理学定律的显而易见的美 — — 我们被它们的对称性和繁茂所吸引 — — 并不令人奇怪。
What remains mysterious is why they are comprehensible.	依然神秘的是为何它们可以被理解。
A profound link between beauty and comprehensibility is an increasingly important source of scientific progress.	美和可理解性之间的意义深远的联系是科学进步日益重要的源泉。
Today’s frontiers of fundamental physics are far removed from everyday experience.	今天的基础物理学前沿早已不是来自日常生活。
They are difficult and expensive to access experimentally, and we cannot rely on our intuition to fill in the blanks.	要想用实验接近它们困难又昂贵，我们也不可能依靠直觉填补空白。
The patient accumulation of fact recommended by Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton, and Sherlock Holmes is thus no longer practical.	因此，培根、牛顿和福尔摩斯所建议的耐心地积累事实已不再具有实践意义。
Instead, we reverse the process, using guesswork to motivate experiment.	相反，我们倒转了这一过程，用猜测驱动实验。
We first construct beautiful equations, then derive their consequences, and, finally, craft experiments to test them.	我们首先构造美妙的方程组，然后导出结果，最后设计实验验证它们。
In recent decades, that strategy has proved remarkably successful.	近几十年来，这一战略取得了令人瞩目的成功。
It has given us quantum chromodynamics, which resolves the central problem of nuclear physics, as well as predicting the Higgs particle and much else.	它给我们带来了量子色动力学，该学科解决了核物理学的核���问题，并预言了希格斯粒子和其他许多成果。
Rather than recognizing the beauty of laws otherwise discovered, we use principles of beauty – vast symmetry and a high ratio of output to input – to enable discovery.	我们不是去认识发现的定律的美，而是用美的原理 — — 高度对称和高投入产出比 — — 来促成发现。
When this works, we have an “anthropic” explanation of the laws’ beauty: If they were not beautiful, we would not have found them.	当这起作用时，我们就有了关于美的定律的“人类”解释：如果它们不美，我们就不会发现它们。
	
Why is the US Presidential Race So Close?	美国总统竞争为何如此接近？
WASHINGTON, DC – Many people around the world are probably wondering why Hillary Clinton – who is obviously more prepared and better suited for the American presidency than her opponent, Donald Trump – isn’t waltzing to victory.	华盛顿—全世界很多人可能正在奇怪为何希拉里·克林顿 — — 她显然比她的对手唐纳德·特朗普准备更充分，也更适合当美国总统 — — 没有势如破竹。
Many Americans share the world’s bewilderment.	许多美国人也有这样的疑惑。
National opinion polls may well continue to fluctuate until the election on November 8.	在11月8日的大选开始前，全国民调很可能将继续摇摆。
But Trump has been closing in on Clinton in recent weeks, even threatening to catch up with her in the Electoral College vote, where the Democrats’ control of some of the most populous states (New York and California) give Clinton an advantage.	但最近几周，特朗普一直在追近希拉里，甚至有望在选举人团（Electoral College）投票中追上她。 民主党控制着一些人口最多的州（纽约州和加利福尼亚州 ） ， 这给了克林顿优势。
Why is this happening?	为什么会这样？
For starters, Trump, despite knowing almost nothing about governance or public policy, has managed to consolidate most Republicans behind him.	首先，特朗普尽管对于治国和公共政策几乎一无所知，但他成功地将大部分共和党人团结在自己背后。
One motivation is Republicans’ long-held hatred of Clinton.	一个动机是共和党对克林顿由来已久的恨意。
Another is the Supreme Court; the court already has one vacant seat for the next president to fill and is likely to have more over the next four years.	另一个动机是最高法院；最高法院已经空出了一个席位，将由下任总统来填补，并且在未来四年中可能还有更多空位。
Trump has also exploited many Americans’ economic anxieties, tapping the same anti-immigrant, anti-elite rage that is sweeping across European countries.	特朗普还利用了许多美国人的经济焦虑，煽动与横扫欧洲诸国类似的反移民、反精英愤怒。
But Trump cannot win by appealing only to white men without a college degree.	但特朗普不可能只凭借诉诸没有大学文凭的白人男性赢得选举。
So he has been clumsily trying to suggest that he also cares about African Americans and Latinos – not by talking to African-American and Latino voters, but by speaking in exaggerated stereotypes about them to white audiences.	因此他一直在笨拙地试图证明他也顾及非洲裔美国人和拉丁裔 — — 不仅仅通过与非洲裔美国人和拉丁裔选民对话，也通过以夸张的语调在白人听众前谈及他们。
Not surprisingly, African-Americans and Latinos consider his comments insensitive and patronizing; white women – his real target audience – haven’t yet been persuaded, either.	毫不奇怪，非洲裔美国人和拉丁裔认为他的评论愚蠢又傲慢；白人女性 — — 他的真正目标听众 — — 也没有被说服。
Meanwhile, Clinton is having her own difficulties reconstructing President Barack Obama’s coalition of women, African Americans, Latinos, and millennials.	与此同时，克林顿在重建奥巴马总统的女性、非洲裔美国人、拉丁裔和千禧一代联盟方面也遇到了困难。
Many young people who passionately supported Clinton’s Democratic primary opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, have ignored Sanders’s own admonitions to support Clinton, and are saying that they’ll vote for third-party candidates, which would help Trump.	许多年轻人热烈支持克林顿的民主党初选对手、参议员伯尼·桑德斯（Bernie Sanders ） ， 现在他们忽视桑德斯本人支持克林顿的劝诫，称他们将投票给其他党派候选人，这将有助于特朗普。
Since the two major parties’ national conventions in July, each candidate has alternately made gains and suffered losses.	自7月份两党召开全国大会以来，两位候选人彼此有得有失。
This month, just as Trump was rising in the polls, he attempted to separate himself from the racist “birther” movement, which falsely claims that Obama – America’s first black president – wasn’t born in the United States, and thus was ineligible for the presidency.	本月，在特朗普在民调中得势的同时，他试图将自己与种族主义“出身论”运动划清界线，后者子虚乌有地宣称美国首任黑人总统奥巴马并非出生在美国，因此没有资格当美国总统。
Trump’s remarks, terse and grudging, reminded everyone that he himself was one of the loudest “birthers” of all.	特朗普简短而勉强的声明提醒所有人，他本人便是最顽固的“出身论”者之一。
His damage-control effort further backfired, because he falsely claimed that Clinton and her 2008 presidential campaign had started the birther rumor.	他的止损举动带来了更多的副作用，因为他错误地宣称克林顿及其2008年总统选战是从出身论流言开始的。
Many news outlets finally used the word “lie” in their coverage of Trump, who had gone essentially unchallenged on past fabrications.	许多新闻媒体最后都用“说谎”一词来报道特朗普，他过去的诸多信口开河基本上都没有受到过挑战。
Trump’s recent polling gains say less about his improvement as a candidate than they do about Clinton’s own weaknesses and bad luck.	特朗普最近在民调中得势与其说是因为他作为候选人有所进步，不如说是因为克林顿自己的弱势和倒霉。
Outside her base of passionate loyalists, Clinton has always had a voter-enthusiasm problem.	除了她的基本盘，克林顿一直面临着选民热情问题。
She comes across to many as a packaged know-it-all, the super-smart girl who put off the boys in school.	对许多人来说，她的形象是万事通，就像学校里令男生汗颜的“学霸 ” 。
And she confronts a fair amount of sexism, even among her supporters.	她还面临着相当大的性别歧视，即使在她的支持者中也是如此。
(A former Democratic governor recently declared that she should smile more.	（一位前民主党州长最近宣称她应该更多地微笑。
Would he have said that about a man?)	他会这样评论男候选人吗？ ）
But Clinton has also created some of her own problems.	但克林顿自己也给自己制造了一些麻烦。
Her poor judgment in using a private email server as Secretary of State, thereby risking the disclosure of classified material, has become a chronic burden for her campaign.	她在担任国务卿期间使用私人邮件服务器，从而导致保密材料有可能泄露，这表明她判断力糟糕，也是她选战中的一个永远的污点。
She compounded the problem when she claimed, falsely, that her predecessors had done the same thing, and that State Department security officials had cleared it.	她错误地宣称她的前任也这么做过，并且国务院安全官员已经清理了邮件，这让问题更加复杂化了。
And, unlike Trump, she received no deference from the press on this issue.	此外，与特朗普不同，在这个问题上，她没有获得媒体的尊重。
The email saga added to voters’ long-held impression that Clinton isn’t “honest and trustworthy,” and it exposed her to attacks from adversaries on the right.	“邮件门”加强了选民由来已久的克林顿不“诚实可信”的印象，也让她饱受右翼对手的攻讦。
The highly conservative advocacy group Judicial Watch has continually called attention to the issue, forcing the disclosure of emails that Clinton hadn’t turned over to the State Department.	高度保守的游说团体司法观察（Judicial Watch）一直在鼓吹关注这一问题，施压披露克林顿没有转交国务院的邮件。
(The FBI found nearly 15,000 emails on Clinton’s server that she hadn’t provided.)	（联邦调查局在克林顿的服务器上找到了近1,500封她没有提供的邮件。
Numerous as-yet-undisclosed emails with the potential to damage Clinton may well be released before the election.	）为数巨大的尚未披露邮件可能在选举前公之于众，危及克林顿的选情。
While FBI Director James Comey decided not to recommend prosecution of Clinton for the email issue, he hurt her campaign by commenting that she’d been “extremely careless.”	尽管联邦调查局局长詹姆斯·科梅（James Comey）决定不建议就邮件问题起诉克林顿，但仍评论说她“非常不谨慎 ” ， 这将危及克林顿的选情。
In any case, the choice not to prosecute had Republicans and conservative commentators howling that she’d received preferential treatment from the Democratic administration.	无论如何，不起诉的选择让共和党和保守派评论家猛烈评级她从民主党政府中获得特殊优待。
Polls showed that 56% of respondents agreed that Clinton should have been prosecuted.	民调显示56%的受访者同意克林顿应该被起诉。
A new issue for Clinton arose in August, when the Associated Press reported that numerous donors to the Clinton Foundation had received special treatment by the State Department during Clinton’s tenure there, mainly by winning an appointment with her.	8月份，克林顿又有了一个新问题。 美联社报道众多克林顿基金会捐赠者在克林顿任职国务卿期间获得了国务院的特殊对待，主要形式是通过她获得任命。
But many of these people would have received an appointment anyway; and there is no evidence that State Department policies were changed as a result.	但这些人中有许多本来就可以获得任命；并无证据表明国务院政策因此被改变。
Meanwhile, the Washington Post has begun to report on questionable – possibly illegal – expenditures by Trump’s own charitable foundation.	与此同时 ， 《 华盛顿邮报》开始报道特朗普本人的慈善基金会的可疑 — — 有可能非法 — — 支出。
Trump, who hadn’t donated to his foundation since 2008, subsequently used its funds to buy personal items (including a six-foot portrait of himself) and to pay legal settlements.	特朗普自2008年以来便再未向基金会捐资，但使用基金会资金购买个人物品（包括衣服他本人的六英尺画像）和支付法律和解费用。
Previously, it had also been disclosed that funds from the Trump Foundation had been used to contribute to the election campaigns of attorneys-general in Florida and Texas, which would also be illegal.	此前，据披露特朗普基金会资金还被用于佛罗里达州和德克萨斯州检察长的竞选活动，这也是非法的。
Finally, Clinton had the bad luck of falling ill, with cellphone video showing her nearly collapsing as she left early a ceremony in New York City commemorating the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack.	最后，克林顿不幸生病，手机视频显示，在9月11日出席纽约市恐怖袭击纪念仪式时她在离开时险些跌倒。
This added further fuel to right-wing media speculation that she is in poor health; Trump added the sexist charge that she lacks the “stamina” to be president.	这进一步助长了右翼媒体猜测她健康有问题；特朗普更是发动性别攻击，说她缺少当总统的“耐力 ” 。
The press covering Clinton were furious to learn that twodays earlier she had been diagnosed with pneumonia and had kept it to herself.	克林顿团队先是说她太疲劳了，后来又披露她两天前被诊断为肺炎。 许多媒体对她不早点披露这一信心感到愤怒。
But American presidential elections are brutal marathons, and it’s understandable that she did not want to cancel planned events.	但美国总统选战是一场残酷的马拉松，她不想取消计划行程完全可以理解。
A later poll showed that the majority of the public agreed.	随后的民调显示大部分公众也同意这一点。
Clinton’s four-day convalescence came just as she was preparing to make the case for why people should vote for her, rather than why they shouldn’t vote for Trump.	克林顿为期四天的康复期正逢她准备向人们解释为什么要投票给她，而不是不投票给特朗普。
Just as she resumed campaigning, there were bombings in New York and New Jersey, and two more police shootings of unarmed African Americans, which spurred demonstrations in North Carolina, a swing state.	她一回归选战，纽约和新泽西就爆发了爆炸事件，更有两起警察枪击未携带武器的非洲裔美国人事件，导致摇摆州加利福尼亚北部爆发游行示威。
The events took over the national dialogue, with Trump, as usual, playing on racial divisions and blaming Obama and Clinton.	这些事件占据了全国对话的焦点，而特朗普像往常一样利用种族分歧并指责奥巴马和克林顿。
This is the background against which the candidates will head into face-to-face debates, which tend to play a large (even excessive) role in shaping US elections.	在这样的背景下，两位候选人将进行面对面辩论，而辩论将给美国选情造成巨大（甚至过度）的影响。
It would be unwise to call this election over before it is.	在此之前就宣布选举结束是不明智的。
	
Pulling the OMT Trigger	扳下OMT扳机
CHICAGO – Europe has been experiencing a period of calm after the storm since European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s “whatever it takes” speech in July and the ECB’s decision in September to proceed with its “outright monetary transactions” (OMT) program to purchase distressed eurozone members’ government bonds.	芝加哥—自欧洲央行行长德拉吉7月“竭尽所能”演讲以及欧洲央行9月决定采取“直接货币交易 ” （ OMT）买入受困欧元区成员国政府债券后，欧洲经历着稳定期。
The interest-rate spreads for Italian and Spanish government bonds have dropped dramatically, corporate-bond issues have resumed, and a sense of normalcy is slowly pervading the continent.	意大利和西班牙政府的利差大幅下降，公司债券发行重现江湖，欧洲大陆也开始逐渐弥漫恢复正常的感觉。
But it would be foolish to conclude that the euro’s problems have been solved.	但这样就认为欧元问题已被解决是愚蠢的。
The economic fundamentals are far from stable, while the reduced financial tension is the fortunate outcome of an expectation game.	经济基本面远远称不上稳定，尽管预期游戏产生了财政压力纾解的幸运效果。
As long as investors believe that Italy and Spain will eventually be rescued by the OMT, these countries’ borrowing costs will be low, and the rescue will not be needed.	只要投资者认为意大利和西班牙最终能够被OMT所救，这些国家的借贷成本就将保持低位，救援也就没有必要实施。
If, however, the slightest doubt about the OMT’s effectiveness arises, the expectation game will shift into reverse, and both countries’ bonds will quickly come under attack.	不过，如果人们对OMT的作用产生哪怕是最轻微的质疑，预期游戏就将向相反的地方发展，两国债券将马上受到攻击。
One such source of doubt may be the OMT’s safety catch.	质疑原因之一的OMT的安全阀装置。
To become operational, all European governments must approve it.	为了使其可操作，所有欧洲国家政府都必须批准它。
The rules vary among EU countries, but, in Germany, “government approval” implies parliamentary approval.	各个欧盟国家的规则各不相同，但在德国 ， “ 政府批准”意味着议会批准。
In an emergency situation, it is difficult to imagine that Germany will not prefer approval to the disaster of an Italian or Spanish default.	在紧急情况下，很难想象德国会放任意大利或西班牙违约而不批准OMT。
Still, any delay could be enough to trigger a bank run in either country.	但是，任何拖延都有可能足以出发意大利或西班牙的银行挤兑。
By the time the German Bundestag decided, it could be too late.	到德国议会作出决定的时候，说不定一切都太晚了。
To eliminate this uncertainty, Italy and Spain should ask for the OMT intervention before it is desperately needed – a request that the Bundestag would most likely approve, viewing it as an insurance scheme rather than a pure transfer.	为了消除这一不确定性，意大利和西班牙应该要求OMT在不得不出手之前就进行干预 — — 这一要求德国议会很可能会批准，将其视为一种保险机制，而不仅仅是转移支付。
Doing so would also eliminate the uncertainty surrounding the program itself and its implementation mechanisms.	如此还能消除围绕在OMT计划本身及其实施机制的不确定性。
Identifying and addressing problems when intervention is not urgently needed is much easier than working them out under the threat of a pending sovereign default.	在干预并非迫切需要的时候识别并纠正问题要比受到迫在眉睫的主权违约的威胁时才动手更容易。
Finally, an early request for OMT intervention would not only reduce the Italian and Spanish governments’ borrowing costs (and thus their fiscal deficits), but would also lower the cost of capital for local firms, which currently find it difficult to borrow and invest.	最后，早早要求OMT干预不但可以降低意大利和西班牙政府的借贷成本（从而降低它们的财政赤字 ） ， 还可以降低本地企业的资本成本，后者目前陷入了借贷和投资困境。
Thus, it would provide a much-needed boost to these countries’ struggling economies.	如此，OMT可以对这些深陷麻烦的国家提供急需的提振。
So, if triggering OMT intervention would be so beneficial, why are the Spanish and Italian governments so reluctant to do so?	那么，既然触发OMT干预的好处是如此之大，为何西班牙和意大利政府不愿这样做？
The main reason is political.	主要原因在于政治。
In the 1930’s, all European governments feared that breaking from the gold standard would be perceived as a sign of weakness.	20世纪30年代，所有欧洲政府都害怕与金本位脱钩将被视为疲软的信号。
As a result, they waited too long.	结果，它们等待了太长时间。
The same is true of the OMT program: elected politicians fear that triggering it would be perceived as a sign of weakness, implying a cost that they have a strong incentive to delay paying.	OMT也是如此：当选政客害怕触发OMT被视为示弱，这就构成了一种成本，他们有强烈的激励推迟该成本的发生。
But why is Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti, who is not an elected politician (and has promised not to run for election), so hesitant?	但为何作为非当选（并承诺不参加竞选）的政客的意大利总理蒙蒂也如此犹豫？
Given that he does not have to fear electoral defeat, he could help Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy by filing first, which would weaken the political stigma for Rajoy’s government were it to file subsequently.	他不用担心在选举中被击败，可以成为第一个要求OMT干预者，从而助西班牙首相拉霍伊一臂之力 — — 如果拉霍伊政府在意大利之后才要求OMT干预，则它就不会面临多少政治难堪。
Triggering OMT now would also be a safe play for Italy in the face of an imminent general election with a highly uncertain outcome.	到现在，触发OMT也是意大利在面临即将到来的结果极不确定的大选时的安全之选。
What is not uncertain is that an anti-euro party, run by a professional comedian, Beppe Grillo, will gain at least 20% of the Italian vote.	确定的是，以职业喜剧演员格里洛（Beppe Grillo）为首的反欧元政党至少将在意大利大选中赢得20%的选票。
The political instability that could ensue would not provide a good opportunity to ask Germany for help.	这可能引发政治动荡，不利于寻求德国的帮助。
In fact, if one were to imagine reasons why Germany might not approve a request by Italy to trigger the OMT, political turmoil would top the list.	事实上，如果你思考一下德国不批准意大利触发OMT的要求的原因，那么政治乱象肯定是首先冒出来的内容。
By contrast, triggering the OMT in advance would promote political stability in the face of uncertainty, because it would tie the hands of any future Italian government.	相反，提前触发OMT将增加面临不确定性时的政治稳定性，因为这能够束缚未来意大利政府的手脚。
Why, then, is Monti not acting?	既然如此，为什么蒙蒂无所作为？
One possible reason is personal pride.	一个可能的原因是个人尊严。
Monti wants to be remembered as the prime minister who saved Italy from disaster.	蒙蒂希望以带领意大利走出灾难的总理被人铭记。
He does not want to go down in history as the prime minister who had to surrender Italy’s sovereignty to save the country from default.	他不愿意在历史上留下将为避免主权��约而将意大利主权拱手出让的总理的名声。
An alternative explanation is that Monti does indeed have political ambitions.	另一个解释是蒙蒂确实怀有政治野心。
While Monti’s mandate was set to last until the election, he might be trying to extend it with the support of the new parliament.	尽管其执政只能维持到大选，但他可能会在新议会的支持下谋求留任。
Delay for either of these reasons would be a very selfish act.	不管出于哪种原因，不作为都是自私的行为。
Monti should not risk European stability for his personal benefit.	蒙蒂不应该因为个人好处而将欧洲稳定性置于风险之中。
He should trigger OMT before it is too late.	他应该在犹未为晚时触发OMT。
	
Italy’s French Temptation	意大利的法国诱惑
FLORENCE – Italy is once again being gulled by the false hope that if it can just “fix” its institutions, its politics will normalize.	佛罗伦萨—意大利再一次受了错误希望的骗，认为只要能够“修正”其制度，其政治就会正常化。
This time, it is the French model that is enticing Italy’s leaders.	这一回，迷惑意大利领导人的是法国模式。
Since February’s inconclusive general election, Italian lawmakers have managed to agree on only one thing: the reelection of 88-year-old President Giorgio Napolitano, which makes him the first two-term president since Italy abolished the monarchy in 1946.	自2月份大选没有产生决定性结果以来，意大利立法者只在一个问题上形成了一致：88岁的纳波利塔诺再一次当选总统，成为自1946年意大利放弃君主制以来第一个连任的总统。
The main center-left and center-right parties that supported Napolitano – despite the protests of Beppe Grillo and his anti-establishment Five Star Movement, which won a quarter of the parliamentary vote – hope that he can oversee the creation of a broad-based coalition government.	支持纳波利塔诺的主流中左翼和中右翼政党希望，在他的监督下，意大利能形成获得广泛支持的联合政府。 不过格里洛（Beppe Grillo）及其反对现状的五星运动党（Five Star Movement，该党赢得了议会选举的四分之一选票）反对纳波利塔诺。
But addressing Italy’s myriad institutional weaknesses – which have led to ungovernability, endemic fragmentation, disfattismo (defeatism), and widespread public frustration with the establishment – will require an overhaul of the country’s political system.	但纠正意大利为数众多的制度弱点 — — 它们导致意大利无从治理，地方各自为政，失败主义盛行，以及公众对现状的普遍沮丧感 — — 要求改变该国的政治制度。
Given that France overcame similar weaknesses and political deadlock with the creation of the Fifth Republic, which includes a robust executive led by a powerful president, the French model seems like an effective one to follow.	法国曾以建立第五共和国的方式 — — 其中包括强势总统领导下的稳健执政 — — 克服了类似的弱点和政治僵局，因此法国模式似乎是可供遵循的善例。
Indeed, at first glance, pursuing such a change in Italy appears simple.	事实上，咋一看，意大利追求类似变化好像易如反掌。
Perhaps it is not surprising that Italians admire France’s Fifth Republic.	也许意大利仰慕法国第五共和国并不令人奇怪。
After all, its governments – unlike those in Italy – have been remarkably stable and relatively durable, lasting 643 days, on average.	毕竟，其政府 — — 与意大利政府不同 — — 令人注目地稳定和相对持久，平均执政时间为643天。
Moreover, no one party or figure has dominated French politics for too long, with power alternating regularly between parties of the left and the right, at least since François Mitterrand’s first victory in 1981.	此外，没有哪个政党或个人能主宰法国政治太长时间，权力定期在左翼和右翼政党之间交替，至少自1981年密特朗首次获选以来是如此。
But, for many Italians, the French political system’s most attractive feature is that the president is the true head of the executive – and, since the presidential and legislative terms were aligned in 2000, that authority has run for five years at a time.	但是，对许多意大利人来说，法国政治制度最吸引人的特征是其总统乃是真正的执政首脑 — — 而自2000年总统和立法任期统一以来，每五年选举一次。
To Italian lawmakers, mired in stalemate and indecision, the French executive’s considerable influence over the parliament is appealing.	对陷于僵局和犹豫的意大利立法者来说，法国行政影响力远高于议会的状态吸引力极大。
That influence is bolstered by the electoral rules’ inherent bias in favor of powerful parties.	这一影响力来自选举规则有利于强势政党的内在偏向性。
Indeed, no electoral system creates a greater vote-seat distortion than France’s two-round majoritarian system.	事实上，没有哪种选举制度能比法国的两轮多数制度更能制造选票-席位扭曲的了。
For example, in 2012, the Socialists obtained nearly 50% of the seats in the National Assembly, despite having won only 29% of the vote in the first round.	比如，2012年法国社会党在国民大会（National Assembly）中赢得近50%的席位，尽管它在第一轮选举中只获得了29%的选票。
The right-wing RPR-UDF coalition did even better in 1993, when it won 38.5% of the vote in the first round but obtained an astonishing 82% of the seats.	右翼的PDR-UDF联盟在1993年的表现甚至更加出色，它在第一轮选举中赢得38.5%的选票，但最终赢得了惊人的82%的议席。
In France, smaller parties can gain parliamentary seats only if they manage to negotiate a pre-election agreement with one of the major parties to secure for them some constituencies.	在法国，小政党要想获得议院席位，必须设法在选举前与某大政党达成协议，以确保拿下一些选区。
One could argue that this system facilitates more efficient governance, and thus could potentially save Italy from its debilitating gridlock.	你可能会说，这一制度有利于更高效的治理，因此可能把意大利从令人疲敝的僵局中拯救出来。
But it is difficult to see how it is good for democracy.	但很难看到这对民主有什么好处。
Before becoming overly enamored of French institutions, Italians should consider what the French think of their own system.	在过度沉迷于法国制度之前，意大利应该考虑一下法国人如何看待自己的制度。
In fact, the French are extremely frustrated with their country’s politics, particularly with their presidents.	事实上，法国人对自己国家的政治感到无比失望，特别是对他们的总统。
This dissatisfaction does not reflect a failure of François Hollande, whose approval rating stands at only 26% one year into his presidential term; his two immediate predecessors, Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy, also left office in disgrace.	这一不满不光体现在奥朗德的失败上 — — 在问鼎总统宝座仅仅一年后，他的支持率只有26 % ； 他的两位前任，希拉克和萨科齐，离职时���颇不体面。
According to Eurobarometer data collected over the last two decades, Italy’s political system, its leaders, and its democratic institutions have the lowest level of citizen satisfaction among the first 15 European Union countries.	根据欧洲晴雨表（Eurobarometer）在过去二十年中所收集的数据，以人民满意度衡量，意大利的政治制度、它的领导人以及它的民主机构在第一批15个欧盟国家中叨陪末座。
But France is a close second.	但法国也只是倒数第二。
Likewise, France is second only to Italy when it comes to the desire to reform and restructure its political institutions.	类似地，在人民改革和重组政治制度意愿排名上，意大利名列第一，而紧随其后的也正是法国。
At the end of the day, there is no institutional reform that could miraculously “save” Italy.	所到底，没有哪种制度改革能奇迹般地“拯救”意大利。
While a semi-presidential system like France’s could enable Italy to suppress symmetric bicameralism and reform the worst aspects of its electoral law (known as porcellum, or “the crap law”), thereby improving governability, it would create as many problems as it would solve.	尽管类似法国的半总统制能让意大利遏制其对称两院制并改革其选举法中最糟糕的的部分（被称为“porecellum ” ， 即“废话法律 ” ） ，从而改善其可治理性，但也它所带来的问题一点也不比它所解决问题少。
French history demonstrates that excessive presidential power is likely to create an almighty and, at times, politically feckless executive, alongside a weak parliament that chronically under-represents a significant proportion of the population.	法国历史表明，总统权力过大可能会形成人造神，有时也会造成政治上软弱的执政者，以及长期无法代表人口大部的弱势议会。
Beyond the incantatory formulas, Italians should reflect carefully on the desirability of adopting such a system.	意大利应该破除迷信，认真考虑是否应该追求这样一套制度。
	
Why Marx Was Wrong	为什么马克思是错误的
STOCKHOLM – The bicentennial of Karl Marx’s birth has occasioned a surge of interest in the man’s work, complete with the unveiling of a statue in his hometown of Trier, Germany.	斯德哥尔摩—卡尔·马克思诞辰两百周年引起对他的著作的兴趣大涨，他的家乡德国特里尔（Trier）揭幕了马克思雕像。
At a celebration of Marxism in Beijing last week, Chinese President Xi Jinping declared that, “like a spectacular sunrise, the theory illuminated the path of humanity’s exploration of the law of history, and humanity’s search for [its] own liberation.”	上周在北京举行的马克思主义纪念大会中，中国国家主席习近平强调 ， “ 。 这一理论犹如壮丽的日出，照亮了人类探索历史规律和寻求自身解放的道路 。 ”
He would go on to claim that Marx “pointed out the direction, with scientific theory, toward an ideal society with no oppression or exploitation, where every person would enjoy equality and freedom.”	接着他又说，马克思“以科学的理论为最终建立一个没有压迫、没有剥削、人人平等、人人自由的理想社会指明了方向 。 ”
Given that Xi’s words were uttered in “Marxist” China, those in attendance had no choice but to agree with them.	习近平的这番话是在“马克思主义”中国说出的，在场各位别无选择，只有同意。
Yet, speaking in Trier on the same day, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker offered a somewhat generous appraisal of his own: “Today he stands for things which is he not responsible for and which he didn’t cause, because many of the things he wrote down were redrafted into the opposite.”	但是，在同一天的特里尔，欧盟委员会主席容克也不吝慷慨平价 ： “ 今天，他代表了他不必负责也非他引起的东西，因为他所写下的很多东西遭到了意义完全相反的改写 。 ”
It is not entirely clear what Juncker meant by this.	容克的这番话到底是什么意思并不完全清楚。
Marxism, after all, has inflicted untold misery on tens of millions of people who have been forced to live under regimes waving its banner.	毕竟，马克思主义给数千万被迫生活在高举它的大旗的体制中的人带来了不可名状的悲惨。
For much of the twentieth century, 40% of humanity suffered famines, gulags, censorship, and other forms of repression at the hands of self-proclaimed Marxists.	在二十世纪的大部分时间里，40%的人类在自称的马克思主义者手中，经受着饥荒、集中营、审查和其他形式的压迫。
In his speech, Juncker seemed to be alluding to the standard counterargument: that communist atrocities throughout the twentieth century were due to some sort of distortion of Marx’s thought, for which the man himself can scarcely be held responsible.	在他的讲话中，容克似乎暗示标准的反驳：贯穿二十世纪的共产主义暴行是因为对马克思思想的某种扭曲导致的，而马克思本人不必为此负责。
Is there anything to this argument?	这一观点有道理吗？
Marx spent most of his life analyzing the political economy of the industrializing mid-nineteenth-century West.	马克思大半辈子都在分析工业化的十九世纪中期西方的政治经济学。
But his enduring relevance owes more to his ideas for the future, and the implications they would have for society.	但他的持续重要性更多来自他关于未来的思想，以及这些思想给社会造成的影响。
In considering his legacy, this area of his thought cannot be ignored.	在思考他的遗产时，他的思想的这一领域不能忽视。
Marx regarded private property as the source of all evil in the emerging capitalist societies of his day.	马克思认为，私有财产是他的时代的新兴资本主义社会的万恶之源。
Accordingly, he believed that only by abolishing it could society’s class divisions be healed, and a harmonious future ensured.	据此，他相信只有消灭私有财产，社会阶级分化问题才能解决，和谐的未来才有保障。
Under communism, his collaborator Friedrich Engels later claimed, the state itself would become unnecessary and “wither away.”	他的合作者恩格斯后来宣称，在共产主义下，国家本身将变得没有必要并将“幻灭 ” 。
These assertions were not made as speculation, but rather as scientific claims about what the future held in store.	这些主张不是作为预测提出，而是作为对未来的科学论断提出。
But, of course, it was all rubbish, and Marx’s theory of history – dialectical materialism – has since been proved wrong and dangerous in practically every respect.	但是，所有这些当然都是垃圾，马克思的历史理论 — — 辩证唯物主义无论从什么角度看，都是错误和危险的。
The great twentieth-century philosopher Karl Popper, one of Marx’s strongest critics, rightly called him a “false prophet.”	二十世纪著名哲学家、马克思主义最强烈的批评者之一卡尔·波普尔（Karl Popper）正确地称马克思为“假先知 ” 。
And, if more evidence were needed, the countries that embraced capitalism in the twentieth century went on to become democratic, open, and prosperous societies.	如果说还需要更多证据的话，看看二十世纪接受了资本主义的国家，纷纷成为民主、开放、繁荣的社会。
By contrast, every regime that has rejected capitalism in the name of Marxism has failed – and not by coincidence or as a result of some unfortunate doctrinal misunderstanding on the part of Marx’s followers.	相反，所有以马克思主义的名义拒绝资本主义的体制，都遭到了失败 — — 这不是巧合，也不是因为马克思的信徒不幸地错误理解了马克思的思想。
By abolishing private ownership and establishing state control of the economy, one not only deprives society of the entrepreneurship needed to propel it forward; one also abolishes freedom itself.	消灭私有产权、建立国家对经济的控制不但让社会失去了推动国家前进的企业家精神，也消灭了自由本身。
Because Marxism treats all contradictions in society as the products of a class struggle that will disappear when private property does, dissent after the establishment of communism is impossible.	马克思将一切社会矛盾都处理为阶级斗争，而阶级斗争会随着私有财产的消失而消失，因此，共产主义成立后不可能再有异见。
By definition, any challenge to the new order must be an illegitimate remnant of the oppressive order that came before.	顾名思义，任何对新秩序的挑战必然此前压迫性秩序的非法残余。
Thus, Marxist regimes have in fact been logical extensions of his doctrines.	因此，马克思主义体制实际上是他的学说的逻辑延伸。
Of course Juncker is right that Marx – who died 34 years before the Russian Revolution – was not responsible for the Gulag, and yet his ideas clearly were.	当然，容克说马克思 — — 他逝世于俄国大革命34年前 — — 不必为古拉格负责是正确的，但他的思想显然需要负责。
In his landmark three-volume study Main Currents of Marxism, the Polish philosopher Leszek Kołakowski, who became a leading critic of Marxism after having embraced it in his youth, notes that Marx showed almost no interest in people as they actually exist.	在其标志性的三卷本研究《马克思主义的主流 》 （ Main Currents of Marxism）中，波兰哲学家、青年时代接受马克思主义但后来成为马克思主义的主要批评者的莱斯泽克·科拉科夫斯基（Leszek Kołakowski）指出，马克思几乎对作为实际存在的人的毫无兴趣。
“Marxism takes little or no account of the fact that people are born and die, that they are men and women, young or old, healthy or sick,” he writes.	“马克思主义基本没有考虑一个事实，即人有出生和死亡，有男女，有老少，有病健 。 ” 他写道。
As such, “Evil and suffering, in his eyes, had no meaning except as instruments of liberation; they were purely social facts, not an essential part of the human condition.”	同样地 ， “ 邪恶和苦难在他眼中除了成为解放的工具之外毫无意义；它们是纯粹的社会事实，而不是人的条件的不可或缺的一部分 。 ”
Kołakowski’s insight helps to explain why regimes that have embraced Marx’s mechanical and deterministic doctrine inevitably must turn to totalitarianism when confronting the reality of a complex society.	科拉科夫斯基的洞见有助于解释，接受了马克思的机械和决定论的体制，在面临复杂社会的现实时，都不可避免地必须变成极权主义。
They have not always fully succeeded; but the results have always been tragic.	它们不总能完全成功；但结果总是悲剧。
For his part, Xi views China’s economic development over the past few decades as “cast iron proof” of Marxism’s continued validity.	至于习近平，他认为中国在过去的经济发展是马克思主义持续的活力的“铁证 ” 。
But, if anything, it is exactly the other way around.	但如果说它们证明了什么的话，内容正好相反。
Remember that it was the China of pure communism that produced the famine and terror of the “Great Leap Forward” and the “Cultural Revolution.”	不要忘了，纯粹共产主义的中国产生了“大跃进”和“文化大革命”的饥荒和恐怖。
Mao’s decision to deprive farmers of their land and entrepreneurs of their firms had predictably disastrous results, and the Communist Party of China has since abandoned that doctrinaire approach.	毛泽东没收农民土地和企业家企业的决定带来了可以预见的灾难性结果，而中国共产党后来也抛弃了这一教条主义方针。
Under Mao’s successor, Deng Xiaoping, the CPC launched China’s great economic “opening-up.”	在毛泽东的继任者邓小平的领导下，中共开启了中国伟大的经济“开放 ” 。
After 1978, it began to restore private ownership and permit entrepreneurship, and the results have been nothing short of spectacular.	1978年后，中国开始恢复私人所有权，允许企业家精神，结果可谓壮观。
If China’s development is being held back by anything today, it is the remnants of Marxism that are still visible in inefficient state-owned enterprises and the repression of dissent.	要论中国的发展今天被什么东西所拖累，那就是可以从无效的国有企业和对异见的压迫中管窥的马克思主义残余。
China’s centralized single-party system is simply incompatible with a modern and diverse society.	中国的中央集权一党制与现代的多元化社会完全不相容。
Two hundred years after Marx’s birth, it is certainly wise to reflect on his intellectual legacy.	马克思诞生已经过去了两百年，思考他的思想遗产毫无疑问是明智的。
We should do so not in celebration, however, but to inoculate our open societies against the totalitarian temptation that lurks in his false theories.	但我们不应该庆祝，而应该让我们的开放社会免疫于潜伏在他的错误理论中的极权主义诱惑。
	
Why Mexico is Sick	墨西哥病在何处
Mexico City – As I reflect on my troubled country, the lyrics of a Bruce Springsteen song come to mind: “We are far, far away from home. Our home is far, far away from us.”	墨西哥城 — — 故乡墨西哥层出不穷的问题让我不禁想起布鲁斯·斯普林斯汀的一句歌词 — — “我们离家乡很远很远；家乡在那很远很远的远方 。 ”
That’s how it feels to live in Mexico nowadays: far from democratic normalcy; far from a health system that inspires confidence; far from a government that builds trust; far from home and close to everything that imperils it.	这句歌词正是今天墨西哥人的真实感受：正常的民主、可靠的医疗卫生体系、可信的政府都已远去，不见了家乡，只剩下危机重重。
My homeland has become a place where too many people are victims, succumbing to a virus, or gunned down by a drug-trafficker; assaulted by a robber, shot by an ill-trained policeman, or kidnapped by a member of a criminal gang.	今天的墨西哥，病毒肆虐、毒贩猖獗、盗贼横行，再加上警察训练无素，有太多人为此丢了性命，太多人被犯罪团伙所挟持绑架。
The flu epidemic, which probably began in the southern state of Veracruz, is yet another sign that all is not well in Mexico.	这场可能源自南部韦拉克鲁斯州的猪流感疫情则给墨西哥目前一团糟的局面雪上加霜。
The country seems to be caught in a permanent, uneasy tug-of-war between the past and the future, between change and the actors who seek to place obstacles in its path.	墨西哥似乎陷入了一场过去与未来、变革与阻碍之间的、永久的、令人不安的拉锯战中。
For example, when initial reports surfaced about the first swine flu cases, it took three weeks for the information to reach federal health authorities, because state governments were reluctant to report cases quickly due to political and electoral considerations.	从这场猪流感疫情暴发来看，各州政府出于政治选举考虑，不愿尽快向上报告疫情，因此直到第一批猪流感病例出现三周以后，墨西哥联邦医疗卫生部门才得到消息。
Mexico faces mid-term elections for Congress in the fall, and President Felipe Calderón’s National Action Party is trailing slightly in the polls over its main rivals, who would like nothing better than to see a health emergency translate into a political defeat.	今年秋天，墨西哥国会将迎来中期选举，总统费利佩·卡尔德龙所在的国家行动党在民意调查中目前略微落后于主要竞争对手。 这些竞选对手最希望看到的莫过于国家行动党在医疗卫生事件上政治行动的失败。
In the face of a public health system that seemed incapable of diagnosing and treating the outbreak quickly, the government felt it had little choice but to shut down Mexico City, dealing a severe blow to an already crippled economy.	疫情暴发后，墨西哥的公共医疗卫生体系似乎无力迅速诊治患者、控制疫情，政府不得不下令“关闭”墨西哥城，给原本已举步维艰的经济带来重创。
In contrast with Mexico’s authoritarian past, when an “imperial presidency” constituted a major obstacle to modernization, power has been dispersed.	与过去阻碍现代化进程的“帝王总统”式独裁统治不同，如今墨西哥权力已不再集中。
What the executive branch has relinquished, or been forced to give up, vested interests have seized.	行政部门放弃或被迫放弃的一部分权力如今已被各既得利益集团所掌控。
The problem is no longer too much power in the president’s hands, but too much power in the hands of “veto centers” – including public-sector unions – that are blocking much-needed reforms, including in the health system.	现在权利过大的不是总统，而是包括公共部门工会在内的各 “否决中心 ” ， 正是它们阻挠了医疗卫生体制改革等一系列亟需推进的改革。
In all likelihood, the 22 reported dead from swine flu reflect a social safety net falling to pieces due to lack of public investment and union recalcitrance.	由于公共投入不足和工会的反对阻挠，墨西哥的社会安全网已千疮百孔，这次疫情中22人死亡就是明证。
The flu also revealed some of Mexico’s other fundamental flaws.	这场猪流感疫情同样也暴露出墨西哥其他根本性缺陷。
The political system has become a peculiar hybrid of authoritarian remnants and newly established mechanisms for transparency.	其特有的政治体制中既含有独裁主义的残余也包括新建立起来的透明机制。
The electoral process has been unable to guarantee decent democratic governance, rein in predatory practices among the political class, or make public officials follow established rules, keep them responsive to citizen preferences, and deter them from channeling public funds into private hands.	现行选举程序下，正当的民主治理得不到保证，政治阶级的掠夺行为屡禁不止，政府官员有章不循、中饱私囊、对民众诉求无动于衷。
Lack of accountability has both encouraged corruption and fed perceptions that abuse remains unpunished. Impunity, in turn, erodes the credibility of the country’s institutions, including public hospitals and clinics.	问责制度的缺失滋生了腐败，滥用职权好像总能逃脱惩罚，这反过来又损害了公立医院、诊所等国家机构的公信力。
Today, conspiracy theories abound in Mexico about the origins of the virus, because government officials are viewed with such ingrained suspicion.	关于疫情病毒的起源，目前在墨西哥有很多传言，民众莫衷一是，因为他们对政府官员早已不再信任。
Throughout the epidemic, citizens have largely obeyed government guidelines and followed public health prescriptions. But that doesn’t mean they trust the government.	猪流感疫情暴发后，墨西哥民众虽然基本上遵照了政府的指示 和公共医疗卫生指南，但这并不意味着他们信任政府。
Public-opinion polls reveal that more than 50% of the population believe that political parties are “not necessary” for the good of the country.	民意调查表明，超过50%的人认为政党间的竞争并不符合国家利益。
Disapproval of Congress is growing, and people’s satisfaction with representative democracy has decreased.	民众对国会的支持率越来越低，对代议民主制度的满意程度也出现了下降。
In the midst of the epidemic, 66% of Mexicans believe that the country is regressing.	疫情暴发后，多达66%的墨西哥人认为墨西哥正在退步。
Seventy-five percent of crimes are not reported due to lack of trust in the authorities, and 98% of crimes are never resolved or punished.	由于民众对当局缺乏信心， 75% 的犯罪案件没有上报；98%的犯罪案件无果而终，犯罪分子仍逍遥法外。
Public opinion seems disenchanted with a democracy incapable of offering tangible solutions to problems, the flu crisis being the most recent example.	民众对于现行民主政体似乎已不抱希望，不指望看到切实的解决方案，而这场猪流感疫情危机则再次证明了这一点。
Saddled by a viral infection, drug-related insecurity, and rising crime, Mexico feels like a besieged place.	病毒的蔓延、毒品的泛滥、社会的动荡、不断上升的犯罪率，墨西哥似乎已四面楚歌、走投无路。
The noted columnist Miguel Angel Granados Chapa wrote last week: “All that’s missing is for Mexico to get peed on by a dog.”	著名专栏作家Miguel Angel Granados Chapa上周就曾写道 ： “ 现在墨西哥就差受狗的胯下之辱了 。 ”
Mexico’s bad health is a symptom of problems that run deeper and are more widespread than swine flu.	墨西哥生病了，其症状的根源比猪流感疫情来得更深更广。
Over the past ten years, political and economic actors intent on preserving the status quo have blocked further democratic change and economic reform, condemning Mexico to move sideways, even as other emerging markets surge ahead.	过去十年中，政界和商界人士为维持现状，阻挠民主和经济的进一步改革，使墨西哥的发展偏离了方向。 而与此同时，其他新兴市场则纷纷崛起。
Lately, political battles among key actors have not been about how to build a more effective of representative political system or a more equitable, dynamic economy, but about how to maintain control of accumulated power or distribute it among their allies.	最近，墨西哥政坛激烈争论的焦点并不是如何建立更有效、更具代表性的政治体系，或更公平、更具活力的经济体系，而是如何继续掌控手中的权利，如何与同盟分配这些权利。
Political parties appear far removed from citizen demands, beset by internal divisions, incapable of addressing deep-rooted inequality and lawlessness, and prone to populist or authoritarian leadership that promises quick fixes to entrenched problems.	各政党忙于处理内部纠纷，无力实现公平、法治，指望善作承诺的民粹主义或独裁主义领导者瞬间把根深蒂固的问题消弭于无形。 对于民众的诉求，它们早已无暇顾及。
Mexico’s current quandary is the flu, but it faces more important challenges than a mutating microbe.	墨西哥当前面临的难题是控制猪流感疫情��但这远远不是其挑战的全部。
With more than 40 million people living in poverty and 7,000 killed in drug-related violence last year, Mexico will need to reform quickly to address what the virus has brought to light: a government far removed from the suffering of ordinary people and too frequently insensitive to their plight.	墨西哥仍有4000万贫困人口，仅去年一年就有7000余人死于毒品相关的暴力事件。 墨西哥需要迅速推进改革，以解决由猪流感疫情所暴露出的根源性问题 — — 即政府对普通民众的疾苦不闻不问、无动于衷。
In this national crisis, Mexico’s people have closed ranks, collaborated, and showed that they are capable of working together to achieve common goals in the public interest.	面对这场全国性的危机，墨西哥人民齐心协力、共克时艰，展现出为公共利益团结奋斗的能力。
But their political and economic elites frequently seem incapable of doing so.	然而，墨西哥政界和商界的精英们似乎常常无法做到这一点。
That is why home seems far, far away for so many Mexicans.	因此，许多墨西哥人才会觉得家乡还在那很远很远的远方。
	
How Economics Survived the Economic Crisis	经济学该如何从经济危机中幸存下来
LONDON – The tenth anniversary of the start of the Great Recession was the occasion for an elegant essay by the Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman, who noted how little the debate about the causes and consequences of the crisis have changed over the last decade.	发自伦敦 — — 在“大衰退”爆发十周年之际，诺贝尔经济学奖获得者，经济学家保罗·克鲁格曼（Paul Krugman）撰写了一篇雅致的论文，指出过去十年来关于危机成因和后果的辩论基本上无甚变化。
Whereas the Great Depression of the 1930s produced Keynesian economics, and the stagflation of the 1970s produced Milton Friedman’s monetarism, the Great Recession has produced no similar intellectual shift.	鉴于1930年代的经济大萧条催生了凯恩斯主义经济学，而1970年代的滞胀则诞生了米尔顿·弗里德曼（Milton Friedman）的货币主义，但“大衰退”却并未产生类似的智力转变。
This is deeply depressing to young students of economics, who hoped for a suitably challenging response from the profession.	这对那些年轻的经济学学子来说可算是非常令人沮丧的，因为他们希望这个专业至少能做出一个有恰当挑战性的回应。
Why has there been none?	但为何却一片沉寂呢？
Krugman’s answer is typically ingenious: the old macroeconomics was, as the saying goes, “good enough for government work.” It prevented another Great Depression.	克鲁格曼的答案果然极为巧妙：正如大家所认定的那样，旧有的宏观经济学“对政府工作来说已经足够了 ” ， 也阻止了另一场大萧条。
So students should lock up their dreams and learn their lessons.	所以学生们应该把自己的梦想先放一放，先把课程学好。
A decade ago, two schools of macroeconomists contended for primacy: the New Classical – or the “freshwater” – School, descended from Milton Friedman and Robert Lucas and headquartered at the University of Chicago, and the New Keynesian, or “saltwater,” School, descended from John Maynard Keynes, and based at MIT and Harvard.	十年前，两大流派的宏观经济学家都在争夺制高点：源自米尔顿·弗里德曼和罗伯特·卢卡斯（Robert Lucas ） ， 大本营位于芝加哥大学的新古典学派 — — 或所谓“淡水 ” ； 沿袭于约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes ） ， 以麻省理工学院和哈佛大学为基地的新凯恩斯学派，或称“咸水 ” 。
Freshwater-types believed that budgets deficits were always bad, whereas the saltwater camp believed that deficits were beneficial in a slump.	淡水派认为预算赤字总是不好的，而咸水阵营相信赤字在经济处于低谷时是有益的。
Krugman is a New Keynesian, and his essay was intended to show that the Great Recession vindicated standard New Keynesian models.	克鲁格曼是一位新凯恩斯主义者，他的论文旨在表明“大衰退”正好证明了标准的新凯恩斯主义模式的有效性。
But there are serious problems with Krugman’s narrative.	但克鲁格曼的叙述存在严重的问题。
For starters, there is his answer to Queen Elizabeth II’s now-famous question: “Why did no one see it coming?”	首先是他对英女王伊丽莎白二世那个“为什么没有人意识到危机即将来临 ？ ” 的著名问题的回答。
Krugman’s cheerful response is that the New Keynesians were looking the other way.	克鲁格曼乐观地回应说新凯恩斯主义者当时正在专心关注其他问题。
Theirs was a failure not of theory, but of “data collection.” They had “overlooked” crucial institutional changes in the financial system.	他们的失败不是理论有问题，而是“数据收集”有误，他们“忽视”了金融体系的重大制度变迁。
While this was regrettable, it raised no “deep conceptual issue” – that is, it didn’t demand that they reconsider their theory.	虽然这确实令人扼腕，但也并未暴露出“深层次的概念问题 ” — —也就是说这并不要求他们去重新思考自己的理论。
Faced with the crisis itself, the New Keynesians had risen to the challenge.	
They dusted off their old sticky-price models from the 1950s and 1960s, which told them three things. First, very large budget deficits would not drive up near-zero interest rates.	在危机来临之时，新凯恩斯主义者奋起迎接挑战。
Second, even large increases in the monetary base would not lead to high inflation, or even to corresponding increases in broader monetary aggregates. And, third, there would be a positive national income multiplier, almost surely greater than one, from changes in government spending and taxation.	他们重新拾起了上世纪五六十年代的粘性价格模型，而该模型也给他们指明了三点：首先，巨额预算赤字不会推高近乎为零的利率；其次，基础货币量的更大幅增长不会导致高通胀，甚至不会导致更广意货币总量的相应增长；第三，政府支出和税收的变化会产生正面的国民收入乘数，而且该数字基本上一定会大于1。
These propositions made the case for budget deficits in the aftermath of the collapse of 2008.	这些主张为2008年经济崩盘后的预算赤字铺平了道路。
Policies based on them were implemented and worked “remarkably well.”	基于这些原则的政策得以施行而且运作得“极为良好 ” 。
The success of New Keynesian policy had the ironic effect of allowing “the more inflexible members of our profession [the New Classicals from Chicago] to ignore events in a way they couldn’t in past episodes.” So neither school – sect might be the better word – was challenged to re-think first principles.	而新凯恩斯主义政策取得如此成就的讽刺性作用在于允许“我们这行中那些更为缺乏灵活性的成员（芝加哥的新古典学派）以一种在过去事件中不可能发生的方式去忽略这类事件 ” ， 因此这两大学派 — — 说不上谁比谁更好 — — 都面临着重新思考自身基本原则的挑战。
This clever history of pre- and post-crash economics leaves key questions unanswered.	这种对崩盘前和崩盘后经济学流变的机智回顾却未能解答一系列关键问题。
First, if New Keynesian economics was “good enough,” why didn’t New Keynesian economists urge precautions against the collapse of 2007-2008?	首先，如果新凯恩斯主义经济学真的“足够良好 ” ， 那为何新凯恩斯主义经济学家未能敦促人们对2007 ~2008年的崩溃加以防范？
After all, they did not rule out the possibility of such a collapse a priori.	毕竟他们的推算也未排除崩盘的可能性。
Krugman admits to a gap in “evidence collection.” But the choice of evidence is theory-driven.	克鲁格曼承认在“证据收集”方面存在差距，但证据的选择是由理论驱动的。
In my view, New Keynesian economists turned a blind eye to instabilities building up in the banking system, because their models told them that financial institutions could accurately price risk.	在我看来，新凯恩斯主义经济学家们对银行系统的不稳定性视而不见，因为他们的模型告诉他们金融机构可以准确地为风险定价。
So there was a “deep conceptual issue” involved in New Keynesian analysis: its failure to explain how banks might come to “underprice risk worldwide,” as Alan Greenspan put it.	所以在新凯恩斯主义分析中曾经出现了一个“深层次的概念问题 ” ： 它无力解释银行如何会像艾伦·格林斯潘（Alan Greenspan）所说的那样“全球一致地低估了​风险 ” 。
Second, Krugman fails to explain why the Keynesian policies vindicated in 2008-2009 were so rapidly reversed and replaced by fiscal austerity.	其二，克鲁格曼没有解释为何在2008~2009年被证明有效的凯恩斯主义政策会如此迅速地被财政紧缩政策逆转和取代。
Why didn’t policymakers stick to their stodgy fixed-price models until they had done their work?	为什么政策制定者未能在完工之前一直坚持使用那套古板的固定价格模型呢？
Why abandon them in 2009, when Western economies were still 4-5% below their pre-crash levels?	为什么在2009年西方经济体经济总量仍然低于事件发生前水平4~5％的时候就放弃了它们呢？
The answer I would give is that when Keynes was briefly exhumed for six months in 2008-2009, it was for political, not intellectual, reasons.	我所给出的答案是，当凯恩斯主义在2008~2009年间被短暂起用了六个月时，这是出于政治而非理智的原因。
Because the New Keynesian models did not offer a sufficient basis for maintaining Keynesian policies once the economic emergency had been overcome, they were quickly abandoned.	由于一系列新凯恩斯主义模型在度过了经济紧张时期后未能为凯恩斯主义政策提供充分的依据，所以很快就被抛弃了。
Krugman comes close to acknowledging this: New Keynesians, he writes, “start with rational behavior and market equilibrium as a baseline, and try to get economic dysfunction by tweaking that baseline at the edges.”	克鲁格曼几乎承认了这一点：他写道，新凯恩斯主义者“以理性行为和市场均衡为基准线，试图通过对基准线的边缘微调来应对经济功能失调 ” 。
Such tweaks enable New Keynesian models to generate temporary real effects from nominal shocks, and thus justify quite radical intervention in times of emergency.	这种微调使得新凯恩斯主义模型能够通过名义货币上的冲击产生暂时性的真实作用，从而证明在紧急情况下实施相当激进的干预手段是合理的。
But no tweaks can create a strong enough case to justify sustained interventionist policy.	但是没有任何微调措施可以为持续的干预政策创造足够强大的理由。
The problem for New Keynesian macroeconomists is that they fail to acknowledge radical uncertainty in their models, leaving them without any theory of what to do in good times in order to avoid the bad times.	新凯恩斯主义宏观经济学家面临的问题在于不愿承认自身模型中存在的极端不确定性，以致缺乏任何理论来指导在景气时期应该做些什么以避免不景气。
Their focus on nominal wage and price rigidities implies that if these factors were absent, equilibrium would readily be achieved.	他们对名义工资和价格刚性的关注似乎意味着倘若不存在这些因素，均衡就能被毫不费力地实现。
They regard the financial sector as neutral, not as fundamental (capitalism’s “ephor,” as Joseph Schumpeter put it).	他们认为金融部门是中性的，而不是基础性的 — — 正如约瑟夫·熊彼特（Joseph Schumpeter）所说的那样是资本主义的“监察官 ” 。
Without acknowledgement of uncertainty, saltwater economics is bound to collapse into its freshwater counterpart.	如果不承认这一不确定性，咸水经济学派必然会沦落到跟淡水学派一个德行。
New Keynesian “tweaking” will create limited political space for intervention, but not nearly enough to do a proper job.	新凯恩斯主义的“微调”可以为干预行为创造出有限的政治空间，但还不足以恰当地完成整个工作。
So Krugman’s argument, while provocative, is certainly not conclusive.	因此克鲁格曼的论点虽然让人觉得有点道理，但肯定还算不上是定论。
Macroeconomics still needs to come up with a big new idea.	宏观经济学还有待提出一个新的大理论来支撑。
	
Why a Sino-American Cold War Won’t Happen	为何中美冷战不会发生
OXFORD – It is often said that the US and China – superpowers at economic, geopolitical, and ideological loggerheads – are heading toward a new cold war.	牛津—经常有人说美国和中国 — — 经济、地缘政治和意识形态的超级大国 — — 正在走向新冷战。
And the rhetoric – at least from one side – has come to resemble that of Winston Churchill’s 1946 “Iron Curtain” speech, one of the inaugural events of the Cold War.	其说辞 — — 至少从一方看 — — 类似于丘吉尔1946年的《铁幕》演说。 丘吉尔的这次演说是冷战拉开序幕的标志性事件之一。
Just this month, US Vice President Mike Pence accused China of predatory economic practices, military aggression against the United States, and attempts to undermine US President Donald Trump.	这个月，美国副总统彭斯指责中国的掠夺性经济政策、对美军事侵略，以及试图削弱美国总统特朗普。
But despite the media hype, a new cold war is not inevitable – or even likely.	但是，媒体固热闹，然则新冷战并非不可避免 — — 甚至连发生的可能性都很小。
To be sure, Chinese leaders, fearing disorder and any weakening of the Communist Party of China’s legitimacy, are determined to prevent the US from forcing changes on China’s political and economic system.	诚然，中国领导人担心失序和中共在中国的合法性削弱，必然会阻止美国迫使中国改变政治和经济制度。
China will continue to pursue reforms at its own pace and in its own way.	中国将继续以自己的节奏和方式实施改革。
For Chinese President Xi Jinping, a top priority is to merge the CPC with the machinery of government in order to reduce corruption and burnish the state’s ideological credentials.	对中国国家主席习近平而言，重中之重是将中共与政府机器融合在一起，消除腐败，让国家的意识形态闪光。
Any attempt to interfere in this process would be crossing a red line.	一切干扰这一进程的动作都会被视为越过红线。
Fortunately for Xi, Trump has no interest in “democratizing” other countries, and he doesn’t seem to have been swayed by the US investors, financiers, and technology titans who want his administration to press for more access to the Chinese economy.	对习近平来说，幸运的是特朗普没兴趣“民主化”其他国家，也没有被迫切想要更深入中国经济的美国投资者、金融家和科技巨头动摇。
No doubt, US tariffs threaten the 18% of Chinese exports that go to the US each year.	毫无疑问，美国的关税威胁着中国对美出口年度总量的18 % 。
But the Trump administration has more urgent priorities than changing China’s system of government, notwithstanding the aggressive rhetoric of US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and White House National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro.	但改变中国治国的制度（system of government）不是特朗普政府最紧迫的重点工作，尽管美国贸易代表罗伯特·莱特希泽（Robert Lighthizer）和白宫国家贸易委员会主任彼得·纳瓦罗（Peter Navarro）气势汹汹。
Trump desperately wants to bolster US manufacturing by repatriating global supply chains and blocking or curbing imports.	特朗普急于通过让全球供应链回流以及阻止和削减进口来提振美国制造业。
“Make America Great Again” is really about making in America again.	“让美国再次伟大”其实就是让美国再次制造。
Still, even if today’s US-China standoff does not evolve into a new cold war, it could weaken both countries and usher in a more multipolar world.	尽管如此，即便当下的美中僵局没有演化为新冷战，也有可能让两国两败俱伤，形成更加多极化的世界。
Within China, US rhetorical broadsides, tariffs, and sanctions may be empowering Xi’s domestic critics.	在中国国内，美国言辞激烈的抨击、关税以及制裁可能会让习近平的国内批评者得势。
And it doesn’t help that China currently has limited options for retaliating.	中国目前报复手段有限也是个问题。
True, it could start to sell off some of its $1 trillion in US dollar reserves.	诚然，它可以抛售部分1万亿美元储备。
But that would weaken the value of the US Treasuries that it continues to hold.	但这将让其剩下的美国国债价值缩水。
Within the US, Trump’s decision to pursue sweeping import tariffs has been described by one industry representative as “the most self-destructive trade act I’ve ever seen.”	在美国国内，特朗普征收全面进口关税的决定被某产业代表描述为“我所见过的最为自杀性的贸易政策 。 ”
And the administration’s renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement – which includes a clause to prevent Canada or Mexico from negotiating with China – has met with similar disdain.	其政府重新谈判北美自由贸易协定 — — 其中一个条款禁止加拿大和墨西哥与中国进行谈判 — — 也遭到了类似的抨击。
Such policies threaten both to destroy US jobs and to alienate America’s allies, many of which are already distancing themselves.	这些政策有可能会毁掉美国的就业岗位，疏远美国的盟友 — — 其中许多已开始自我疏远。
Indeed, the Trump administration’s “America First” positions have increasingly translated into “America Alone.”	事实上，特朗普政府的“美国优先”立场已日益转变为“美国孤立 ” 。
The US now constitutes a minority of one within the G7, the G20, and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.	目前，美国已是G7、G20和联合国气候变化框架公约的孤家寡人。
After Trump pulled the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the remaining parties moved ahead on their own.	特朗普令美国退出跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（TPP）后，其他各方在继续前进。
Far from setting the terms of debate on international issues, the Trump administration has convinced other countries to reduce their reliance on US leadership.	特朗普政府没能为国际问题的争论制定规范，反而让其他国家决定降低对美国领导的依赖。
Widespread circumvention of the US will hasten the emergence of a new multipolar order.	普遍的规避美国现象将加快新多极秩序的出现。
For example, by withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, Trump has essentially dared the United Kingdom, France, Germany, China, Russia, and the European Union to defy US prerogatives.	比如，特朗普退出伊朗核协议其实起到了让英国、法国、德国、中国、俄罗斯和欧盟敢于否认美国的特权的效果。
For now, countries that rely on Iranian oil may have no choice but to go along with the US.	现在，需要依靠伊朗石油的国家可能别无选择，只能与美国站边。
Like most traded goods, oil exports are paid for in dollars – largely through the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) in Belgium – and the US has the power to shut down such transactions.	和大部分贸易品一样，石油出口用美元支付 — — 主要是通过位于比利时的世界银行间通讯协会（SWIFT）进行 — — 美国有权力切断这些交易。
Most companies and countries have concluded that doing business in Iran is not worth losing access to the US market and the international dollar-payments system.	大部分公司和国家认为与伊朗做生意还无法与失去美国市场和国际美元支付体系相提并论。
But in the future, they may no longer have to make such tradeoffs.	但在未来，它们也许根本不必做出这样的权衡。
On August 21, Germany’s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, urged Europe to establish payment channels that are independent of the US.	8月21日，德国外交部长海科·马斯（Heiko Maas）敦促欧洲建立独立于美国的支付渠道。
And the following month, the EU’s foreign policy chief announced plans to form a “special purpose vehicle” to “assist and reassure economic operators pursuing legitimate business with Iran.”	9月，欧盟外交政策长官宣布准备成立“特殊目的机构”以“协助和确保经济运营者与伊朗进行合法的业务往来 。 ”
Meanwhile, Russia has said that it is developing its own system for financial transfers, to protect itself from being shut out of the SWIFT system in the event of harsher US sanctions.	与此同时，俄罗斯说它正在开发自己的金融转账系统，以免因为美国制裁升级而被排斥在SWIFT系统之外。
And China has been pursuing a similar project at least since 2015, when the People’s Bank of China launched a system to facilitate cross-border transactions in renminbi.	中国则至少从2015年就开始实施类似的计划，中国人民银行推出了便利跨境人民币交易的系统。
None of these alternative systems have yet to match the convenience of SWIFT and the dollar system.	目前，这些替代方案无一能够比拟SWIFT和美元系统的便利性。
But if a new system were to take hold, it could rapidly shift power away from the US.	但如果新系统站稳了脚跟，就有可能迅速从美国手中夺取权力。
Rather than a cold war, the world may be heading toward an international system led by four powers, with the US, China, Russia, and Germany dominating their respective regions and seeking the upper hand in international negotiations.	世界可能没在迈向冷战，而是在迈向由四方力量领导的国际体系，美国、中国、俄罗斯和德国主导各自的地区，并在国际谈判中争夺上风。
Such a scenario is reminiscent of the World War II vision of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who proposed that the four victorious allies – the US, the UK, China, and the Soviet Union – act as “Four Policemen,” each patrolling its own sphere of influence and negotiating with the others on world peace.	这一情景让人想起了美国总统小罗斯福的二战愿景 — — 他提出由美国、英国、中国和苏联四个战胜同盟国组成“四大警察 ” ， 各自巡查自己的势力范围，并与其他三方协商世界和平。
Today, approximations of the same four powers are once again in the lead, only now we have stronger international institutions to help keep the peace.	如今，基本相同的四股力量再一次领先，只不过这一次我们拥有更强大的国际制度帮助维持和平。
Whether that peace lasts will depend on the willingness of the four powers to use and adapt those institutions to the emerging international system.	和平能否持续将取决于四强运用和调整这些制度，使之与新形成的国际体系匹配的意愿。
	
Natural-Born Pianists?	天生钢琴家？
LONDON – The editor of The Guardian, Alan Rusbridger, has written a book about how he decided to practice the piano 20 minutes a day.	伦敦 一 《卫报》编辑艾伦·拉斯布里哲（Alan Rusbridger）写了一部关于他如何决定每天弹20分钟钢琴的书。
Eighteen months later, he played Chopin’s fearsomely difficult Ballade No. 1 in G Minor to an admiring audience of friends.	18个月后，他弹出了肖邦难度极高的G小调一号叙事曲，围观亲友为之倾倒。
Could anyone have done this?	任何人都能做到这一点吗？
Or did it require special talent?	还是说着需要特别的天分？
The nature-versus-nurture debate has been around a long time. It is unresolved because the scientific question has always been entangled with politics.	先天-后天争论由来已久，至今仍未解决，因为这一科学问题总是与政治纠结不清。
Broadly speaking, those stressing inborn capacity have been political conservatives; those emphasizing nurture have been political radicals.	大体说来，强调天赋异禀的是政治保守派，强调后天的是政治激进派。
The nineteenth-century philosopher John Stuart Mill was of the “anyone can do it” school.	19世纪哲学家约翰·穆勒是“人人都是天才”派成员。
He was convinced that his achievements were in no way due to superior heredity: anyone of “normal intelligence and health,” subjected to his father’s educational system – which included learning Greek at the age of three – could have become John Stuart Mill.	他相信他的成就跟基因优良毫无关系：任何“智力和健康状况正常者”在其父的教育制度下 — — 包括从三岁开始学习希腊文 — — 都可以变成约翰·穆勒。
Mill was part of his century’s liberal attack on aristocratic privilege: achievement was the result of opportunity, not birth.	穆勒是当时对贵族特权发起攻击的人之一：成就来自机会，而不是出身。
The practice of the faculties (education) unleashes potential that would otherwise remain dormant.	学校（教育）实践能激发隐藏的潜能。
Charles Darwin seemingly overturned this optimistic view of the potential beneficial effects of nurture.	查尔斯·达尔文似乎扭转了这一后天努力潜在积极影响的乐观观点。
Species evolve, Darwin said, through “natural selection” – the random selection, through competition, of biological traits favorable to survival in a world of scarce resources.	达尔文说，物种通过“自然选择”进化 — — 即通过竞争随机选择生物特征有利于在资源稀缺的世界生存的物种。
Herbert Spencer used the phrase “survival of the fittest” to explain how societies evolve.	赫伯特·斯宾塞用“适者生存”来解释社会演化。
Social Darwinists interpreted natural selection to mean that any humanitarian effort to improve the condition of the poor would impede the progress of the human race by burdening it with an excess of drones.	社会达尔文主义者对自然选择的解读是，这意味着改善穷人条件的人道主义努力会产生过多的懒汉，从而阻碍人种进步。
Society would be spending scarce resources on losers rather than winners.	社会将把稀缺资源用于输家而不是赢家。
This fit the ideology of a brand of capitalism that was “red in tooth and claw.”	这符合“野蛮”资本主义观念。
Indeed, social Darwinism provided a pseudo-scientific justification for the American belief in laissez-faire (with the successful businessman epitomizing the survival of the fittest); for eugenics (the deliberate attempt to breed superior individuals, on the model of horse-breeding, and prevent the “over-breeding” of the unfit); and for the eugenic-cum-racial theories of Nazism.	事实上，社会达尔文主义为美国人的自由放任信仰（成功商人即生存下来的适者 ） 、 优生学（按照育马模式有意识地选育超级个人，防止不适者的“过度繁育 ” ） 以及纳粹的优等人种理论提供了伪科学的论据。
In reaction to social Darwinism’s murderous tendencies, Mill’s view became dominant after World War II in the form of social democracy.	为了对付社会达尔文主义这残暴倾向，穆勒的观点在二战后以社会民主的形式成为主流。
State action to improve diet, education, health, and housing would enable the poor to realize their potential.	改善饮食、教育、卫生和住房条件的国家行动能让穷人实现自己的潜能。
Competition as a social principle was downgraded in favor of cooperation.	竞争作为社会原则，其重要性不如合作。
Differences in innate ability were not denied (at least by the sensible).	先天能力的差别并没有被否认（至少理智者没有否认 ） 。
But it was rightly felt that there was a huge amount of work to be done to raise average levels of achievement before one needed to start worrying that one’s policies were promoting the survival of the unfit.	但一种正确的观念是可以通过大量工作提高成就的平均水平，然后再开始担心某政策会有利于不适者的生存不迟。
Then the mood began to shift again.	接着，情绪又开始了转变。
Social democracy was attacked for penalizing the successful and rewarding the unsuccessful.	社会民主受到了抨击，因为它惩罚成功者，奖励不成功者。
In 1976, the biologist Richard Dawkins identified the unit of Darwinian selection as the “selfish gene.”	1976年，生物学家理查德·道金斯识别出达尔文主义选择单元，称之为“自私的基因 ” 。
The evolutionary story was now recast as a battle of genes to secure their survival over time by means of mutations, which create individuals (phenotypes) best adapted to pass on their genes.	如今，进化的故事被演绎成基因生存战，随着时间的推移，各种基因通过突变保证其生存，于是产生了最适于传递基因的表型。
In the course of evolution, the inferior phenotypes disappear.	在进化过程中，劣等表型消失了。
Although this view of evolution would not have been possible before the discovery of DNA, it is no coincidence that it rose to prominence in the age of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher.	尽管这一进化观点在DNA发现之前根本不可能出现，但其在里根和撒切尔时代成为主流并非巧合。
To be sure, the selfish gene needs to be “altruistic” insofar as its survival depends on the survival of the kinship group.	平心而论，在生存取决于亲族的生存时，自私的基因需要“利他 ” 。
But it need not be that altruistic.	但此利他非彼利他。
And, although Dawkins later regretted calling his gene “selfish” (he says that “immortal” would have been better), his choice of adjective was certainly best adapted to maximizing sales of his book at that particular time.	此外，尽管道金斯后来又后悔将他的基因称为“自私 ” （ 他说 ， “ 不朽”更合适 ） ， 但他对形容词的选择毫无疑问最适合在当时的特定时期最大化其著作销��。
Since then, we have turned away from advocacy of selfishness, but we have not recovered an independent moral language.	此后，我们开始远离自私论，但尚未重新找到新的独立道德规则。
The new orthodoxy, suitable for a world in which the unrestrained pursuit of greed has proved economically disastrous, is that the human species is genetically programmed to be moral, because only by acting morally (caring for the survival of others) can it ensure its long-term survival.	新正统 — — 适合不受约束的贪婪已被证明市场灾难的世界 — — 是人类基因程序设定是让其符合道德，因为有道德（关心他人生存）能保证其自身的长期生存。
The “hard-wiring” metaphor dominates contemporary moral language.	“硬接线”比喻主导着当代道德观念。
According to the United Kingdom’s chief rabbi, Jonathan Sacks, religious beliefs are useful for our survival, by inducing us to act in socially cooperative ways: “We have mirror neurons that lead us to feel pain when we see others suffering,” he recently wrote.	根据英国首席拉比乔纳森·萨克斯（Jonathan Sachs）的说法，宗教信仰有利于我们的生存，因为它让我们的行为变成社会合作：他最近写道“我们拥有镜像神经元，这让我们在目睹他人遭难时感同身受 。 ”
Consideration for others is “located in the prefrontal cortex.”	而宗教“重新配置了我们的神经通路 。 ”
And religion “reconfigures our neural pathways.” In short: “Far from refuting religion, the Neo-Darwinists have helped us understand why it matters.”	简而言之 ， “ 新达尔文主义绝不排斥宗教，反而有助于我们理解为何宗教很重要 。 ”
So we need not fear that it will decline.	因此我们不必担心宗教衰落。
Atheists might not agree.	无神论者可能不会同意。
But it is an extraordinary statement for a religious leader to make, because it sets to one side the question of the truth or falsehood, or the ethical value, of religious beliefs.	但宗教领袖作此言论是极不寻常的，因为这集中于真理和谬误，或宗教信仰的道德价值问题的一面。
Or rather: all that wiring in the prefrontal cortex must be ethical, because it is good for survival.	或者说，所有前额皮质内的通路都是道德的，因为这有助于我们的生存。
But, in that case, what ethical value is there in survival?	但是，既然如此，那里生存着什么道德价值呢？
Does the continued survival of the human race have any value in itself, independent of what we achieve or create?	人类的持续生存自有其价值，不论我们的成就和创造吗？
We need to rescue morality from the claims of science.	我们需要从科学角度拯救道德。
We need to assert what philosophers and religious teachers have at all times asserted: that there is something called the good life, apart from survival, and our understanding of it has to be taught, just as Mill’s father taught him the elements of Aristotle’s Posterior Analytics.	我们需要维护哲学家和宗教导师时刻教导的 — — 有一种东西叫美好生活（good life ） ， 它独立于生存之外，对它的理解需要有人教导，正如穆勒的父亲教他亚里士多德《后分析篇》的内容。
Our nature may predispose us to learn; but what we learn depends on how we are nurtured.	我们的天性或许能驱使我们学习，但学习什么取决于后天接受。
	
Obama’s Rocky Path to Success in Syria	奥巴马在叙利亚艰难的成功之路
NEW YORK – In my experience, if you are attacked for your diplomacy from both left and right, by doves and hawks, and by internationalists and isolationists, you probably have it just right.	纽约 — — 以我的经验，如果左右翼势力、鸽派和鹰派、国际主义者和孤立主义者同时攻击你的外交政策，那么你的政策可能恰到好处。
In the avalanche of commentary on this month’s US-Russia deal on Syria’s chemical weapons, few have been prepared to call it a “win-win-win” outcome for the United States, Russia, and the Syrian people.	在对本月美俄叙利亚化武交易雪片般的评论中，很少有人认为这是美国、俄国和叙利亚民众共赢的结果。
But – at least so far – that is what it is.	但至少从目前看，恰恰出现了这样的状况。
President Barack Obama and his team, despite some missteps, deserve most of the credit.	虽然有些失误，但大部分功劳应当归结于奥巴马总统及其团队。
The charge sheet against Obama over Syria is long.	奥巴马在叙利亚有很多可以指责的东西。
The US, it is said, took no decisive action while 100,000 Syrians were dying, and it had no strategy to end the conflict.	人人都说美国在100,000叙利亚民众面临死亡时没有采取果断行动，也没有拿出结束冲突的策略。
Obama created expectations that the US would act if chemical weapons were used, only to stall when the time came.	奥巴马创造了启用化学武器就会招致美国军事行动的预期，但那一刻真正到来时却又找出各种托辞。
Then, when a response became unavoidable, he threatened both too much and too little military force.	之后，当不可避免要做出反应时，他总是言辞威胁，却极少诉诸武力。
He paid too little, then too much, attention to domestic opponents of intervention.	他先是太不注重、之后又太过注重国内反对干预的势力。
Above all, he allowed an ever-cynical Kremlin to outplay the US diplomatically.	最重要的是，他让玩世不恭的克里姆林在外交上抢占了先机。
But consider the constraints.	但我们必须考虑到其中的诸多限制。
There was never a time in the crisis, until the chemical-weapons issue erupted, when US military intervention in any form seemed likely to save more lives than it would endanger.	直到化武问题爆发之前，美国军事干预在危机中害人的机率从来都大于救人的机率。
The increasing influence of jihadists in the rebel ranks made support for an outright opposition victory increasingly untenable.	圣战者在叛军队伍中的影响日益扩大让反对派获得全胜的可能性越来越小。
There simply was not enough hard evidence of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons, at least before the Ghouta massacre in August, to pressure Russia – either in the United Nations Security Council or the court of global opinion – to reconsider its reflex support of the regime.	至少在叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德在8月的古塔（Ghouta）大屠杀中使用化学武器之前，无论是在联合国安理会还是全球舆情领域，根本没有足够的铁证能够迫使俄国重新考虑其对阿萨德政权的习惯性支持。
Moreover, while the Obama administration remained determined to preserve US leadership in responding – with force, where necessary – to mass atrocity crimes (the global “responsibility to protect” agenda), a decade of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan has left Americans desperately war-weary.	此外，虽然奥巴马政府依然决心维护美国在应对大规模暴行（全球“保护责任”议程 ） （ 必要的话不排除武力应对）中的领导地位，十年的伊拉克和阿富汗战争已经让美国人感到极度疲惫。
That is true in the West generally, as shown by the United Kingdom’s parliamentary vote against participating in any intervention.	这种情绪在西方非常普遍，比如英国议会就投票反对参与任何干预行动。
For almost everyone, George W. Bush’s “decisiveness” made vacillation seem like a better option.	几乎所有人都认为乔治·W·布什的“果断”还不如犹豫。
Against this background, consider what Obama has achieved.	在这样的背景下再看看奥巴马取得的成绩。
A descent into chemical-weapons hell has been averted, almost certainly permanently: the Assad regime knows that it has no friends or protectors left should it cross that red line again.	堕入化武地狱的恐怖局面已经避免，而且几乎肯定具有永久性：阿萨德政权知道如果再次越过红线朋友和保护伞都将不复存在。
Military intervention, with all of its problems, has been avoided for now; but Assad knows that the US will have no option but to attack – with or without explicit Security Council and Congressional resolutions – should he perpetrate another such horror.	能造成诸多问题的军事干预至少目前得以避免；但阿萨德知道不管有没有明确的安理会和国会决议，如果他再次进行这样的恐怖活动，美国将别无选择只能干预。
Above all, diplomatic cooperation on chemical weapons has opened the door at last to a negotiated settlement of the underlying conflict in Syria.	最重要的是，化武外交合作最终打开了谈判解决叙利亚冲突的大门。
And the UN is back at center stage, as a rules-based international order demands that it should be on such issues, with both its weapons inspectors and the Security Council regarded as central to future developments.	联合国也像以规则为基础的国际秩序所要求的那样回到了舞台的中央，武器核查人员和安理会被视为未来形势发展的核心角色。
Yes, there were some things that could and should have been done differently.	是的，总有些问题可以而且应当采取不同的处理方式。
There always are.	永远会有改进的余地。
If the justified intervention in Libya by the US, the UK, and France had not later been conducted with such cloth-eared indifference to Russian, Chinese, and developing-country concern about mandate overreach, greater unity on Syria could have been achieved in the Security Council in 2011, when a united message might have stopped Assad cold.	如果美、英、法等国的正当干预后来没有以无视俄、中和其他发展中国家对越权干预担心的方式进行，安理会在2011年或许就能在叙利亚问题上更加团结，各方发出的联合讯息或许已经阻止了阿萨德的胡作非为。
Going to Congress for approval was always going to involve more risks than rewards.	报请国会批准所伴随的风险几乎肯定要大于收益。
Secretary of State John Kerry’s description of the planned US military response to the Ghouta massacre as likely to be “unbelievably small” almost derailed the utility of the US threat in concentrating Syrian and Russian officials’ minds.	约翰·克里国务卿有关美国对古塔大屠杀的军事应对计划可能“令人难以置信的微不足道”的描述几乎彻底消灭了美国在叙利亚和俄罗斯官员眼中的威胁。
And the administration could have helped itself by better explaining that a cooperative response to the Assad regime’s use of chemical weapons had long been on the table, and was not just the result of deftly opportunistic Russian diplomacy in response to a Kerry thought-bubble.	而奥巴马政府更好地解释对阿萨德政权使用化武的合作策略其实一直存在，而并非俄国对克里思想泡沫所做出的灵光一现的机会主义外交反应可能会有所帮助。
What has trumped these missteps, and enabled each side to focus on opportunities rather than excuses, is that both the US and Russia now understand that they have common interests in Syria.	美国和俄罗斯现在清楚他们在叙利亚拥有共同利益掩盖了这些失误，使得各方对机会而不是借口更加关注。
Both sides want not only to preclude the Assad regime’s further use of chemical weapons, but also to find a route to sustainable peace in Syria, and to reestablish the authority and utility of the UN in these situations.	双方想要的不只是杜绝阿萨德政权进一步使用化学武器，而且要找到叙利亚持久和平之路，并且重建联合国在类似情况下的权威和效用。
Of course, optimism must be tempered.	当然，还必须逐步培养乐观主义。
Plenty can go wrong in the period ahead.	今后还有很多��以犯的错误。
Either a beleaguered Assad or an increasingly desperate opposition might destroy the deal on the ground.	身处困境的阿萨德或者越来越绝望的反对派都有可能破坏已经达成的协议。
The fragile rapprochement between the US and Russia may not hold, particularly if the US again insists – breaking its recent helpful silence – that Assad has no place at the negotiating table.	美俄之间的脆弱和解可能无法坚持，特别是如果美国打破近来有益的沉默，再次提出谈判桌上没有阿萨德的位置。
But when the major powers cooperate in a just cause, the world is a safer and saner place.	不过当大国合作完成正义的事业，世界就会变得更加安全和理智。
That is where both the US and Russia – and on this issue China as well – want to be.	那是美国、俄国（在叙利亚问题上还有中国）希望看到的结果。
If Obama’s caution and flexibility have been the key to getting us here, let us give praise where it is due.	如果奥巴马的谨慎和灵活是我们实现目标的关键所在，那么让我们不吝给予它应有的评价。
	
The US with Iran in Syria	美国和伊朗在叙利亚
PRINCETON – The prospect of a US military strike on Syria has dimmed following President Barack Obama’s embrace of an international initiative to take control of Syria’s chemical-weapons stockpile.	普林斯顿 — — 继美国总统奥巴马接受控制叙利亚化学武器库存的国际倡议之后，美国军事打击叙利亚的可能性已经越来越小。
The eleventh-hour U-turn on the push for military action has come against a backdrop of intensifying diplomatic pressure from the international community to avoid escalation of the violence in Syria.	国际社会呼吁避免叙利亚暴力活动升级的外交压力越来越强，直接导致了此次军事行动在最后时刻调头。
And that outcome is not possible without Iran.	没有伊朗的参与根本不可能实现这一目标。
In a joint press conference with his Syrian counterpart, Walid al-Moallem, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov tabled a proposal, originally agreed with Iran, calling for Syria to “place chemical weapons storage sites under international control.”	在与叙利亚外长瓦利德·穆阿利姆的联合新闻发布会上，俄罗斯外长拉夫罗夫提出了一份最初与伊朗达成一致的议案，呼吁叙利亚“将化学武器的储存点置于国际控制之下 。 ”
The stockpiles would then be destroyed and Syria would fully join the international Chemical Weapons Convention.	化学武器库存将会被销毁，同时叙利亚将全面加入国际《禁止化学武器公约 》 。
The second component of the Russian-Iranian proposal calls for international efforts, under the auspices of the United Nations Security Council, to rein in Syrian rebel forces’ chemical-weapons capabilities.	俄伊提案的第二部分呼吁在联合国安理会主持下展开国际努力，以遏制叙利亚叛军使用化学武器。
Moallem immediately embraced the proposal.	穆阿利姆立即接受了这项提议。
Hours later, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon did as well, while Obama said that “I fervently hope that this can be resolved in a non-military way.”	几小时后，联合国秘书长潘基文也表示赞同，奥巴马则表示“我热切希望能够以非军事方式解决这一问题 。 ”
This initiative would allow Obama to escape from a messy political and foreign-policy predicament.	这项倡议能使奥巴马摆脱杂乱无章的政治和外交政策困局。
But the matter is far from settled: Obama has not ruled out a military strike.	但问题还远远没有解决：奥巴马并没有彻底放弃军事打击。
So here are 12 reasons why America should grasp the opportunity for a diplomatic resolution afforded by the Russian-Iranian plan.	因此有12条理由支持美国抓住俄伊计划所带来的叙利亚问题的外交解决机会。
First, there is evidence that the Syrian opposition has amassed chemical weapons.	首先，有证据表明叙利亚反对派已经积聚了化学武器。
In December 2012, Iran officially informed the US about chemical weapons, including sarin gas, being transferred to Syria.	2012年12月，伊朗正式通知美国有迹象表明沙林毒气等化学武器正在运往叙利亚国内。
The US declined to cooperate with Iran to press ahead on the case.	美国拒绝与伊朗合作解决这一问题。
Second, US military strikes on Syria have the potential to engulf the entire region – and perhaps the US – in a broader war.	其次，美国军事打击叙利亚有可能引燃大规模战火吞噬整个地区 — — 甚至可能包括美国自己。
After its experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq over the past decade, the US can hardly afford a Syrian quagmire.	有了过去10年在阿富汗和伊拉克的经历，再次陷入叙利亚泥潭超出了美国的承受能力。
Third, with the regional Sunni-Shia conflict intensifying, the prospect of tens of billions of petrodollars backing terrorist extremists has already destabilized the region.	第三，在逊尼派和什叶派冲突加剧的大背景下，数以亿计的石油美元支持恐怖主义极端分子的预期已经破坏了地区的稳定局势。
US military strikes against Syria would further fuel extremism and result in widespread atrocities by the rebels against Syrians of all faiths.	美军事打击叙利亚将进一步助长极端主义，导致叛军对所有信仰的叙利亚人发动大规模暴行。
Reports point to the execution and mutilation of Syrian-government prisoners.	报告直指对叙利亚政府囚犯的处决和酷刑。
There is no doubt that the fate of Syria’s Christian and Jewish communities is now extremely precarious.	叙利亚基督教和犹太教群体的命运现在无疑极不稳定。
Fourth, America’s decision to back extremists in Syria contradicts its “war on terrorism” and will erode international support for it.	第四，美国决定支持叙利亚极端分子与它的“反恐战争”自相矛盾，并将削弱国际社会对反恐的支持。
The prospect of Iranian cooperation to root out Al Qaeda extremists, which it provided in Afghanistan and Iraq, would be unlikely following any intervention.	如果真的进行军事干预，几乎不可能指望伊朗像在阿富汗和伊拉克那样协助消灭“基地”极端分子。
Fifth, it is wrong to assume that without Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Iran would lose its influence in the Muslim world as well as its link to Hezbollah in Lebanon.	第五，假设没有叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德，伊朗就会失去在穆斯林世界的影响力和与黎巴嫩真主党的联系根本就没有依据。
America’s regional position weakened, and Iran’s strengthened, following the US-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq; US intervention in Syria could reproduce that pattern.	在以美国为首的阿富汗及伊拉克入侵行动后，美国的地区地位有所削弱，而伊朗则反之。
Sixth, a US attack on Syria would leave the US isolated internationally and end any hope of a diplomatic resolution.	第六，袭击叙利亚将导致美国在国际上陷入孤立，而且再没有希望通过外交途径解决问题。
There is no domestic or international appetite for another US military adventure – NATO, the G-20, the Europeans, Russia, China, and 60% of Americans oppose a unilateral US military strike.	美国国内或国际社会都不愿看到美国再次进行军事冒险 — — 北约、G-20、欧洲、俄罗斯、中国和60%的美国人都反对美国单方面发动军事打击。
Seventh, the civilian casualties arising from a military strike would be high.	第七，军事打击将造成大量的平民伤亡。
If the main justification for an attack is humanitarian – to end the senseless slaughter of Syrian civilians – US military intervention would do more harm than good.	如果发动袭击的主要理由是人道主义（结束对叙利亚平民的毫无意义的屠杀 ） ， 美国军事干预将弊大于利。
Eighth, US involvement in Syria will breathe new life into efforts to press for a wider war between the US and Iran.	第八，美国卷入叙利亚内战将为游说美伊大规模开战的势力注入新的生命力。
Al Qaeda affiliates will target US regional interests in the hope that the blame falls on Iran and its militant proxies – providing a pretext for US military confrontation.	基地组织分支机构将针对性打击美国的地区利益，希望将责任推给伊朗及其好战代理 — — 进而为美国军事对抗创造托辞。
Ninth, a US military strike against a third Muslim-majority country would demolish the credibility of Obama’s efforts to repair America’s image in the Islamic world.	第九，美国第三次对以穆斯林为主的国家发动军事袭击将摧毁奥巴马政府修复美国在伊斯兰世界形象努力的可信性。
Indeed, it would most likely prove to be a strategic boon to the “resistance axis” – Iran and Hezbollah.	事实上，最后袭击很可能被证明是对伊朗和真主党等“抵抗轴心”的战略福音。
Tenth, any US unilateral military strike against Syria would ratchet up tensions between the US and Russia.	第十，美国对叙利亚的任何单边军事打击都可能加剧美俄两国间的紧张关系。
This, in turn, would strengthen the Russia-Iran alliance.	这将反过来增强俄伊联盟的实力。
Eleventh, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has issued permission for President Hassan Rouhani’s new administration to enter into direct talks with the US.	十一，伊朗最高领袖哈梅内伊许可新组建的哈桑·鲁哈尼总统政府与美国直接会谈。
No better opportunity to end decades of bilateral hostility is likely to come along.	恐怕不会有比这更好的机会结束几十年的双边敌对关系。
In these circumstances, a US attack on Syria would almost certainly dash any hope of a US-Iran rapprochement for years to come.	在这种情况下，美国对叙利亚的袭击几乎肯定将使今后几年的美伊和解希望完全破灭。
Finally, with the moderate Rouhani now installed as President, a US military strike could undermine a golden opportunity for America and Iran to reach a face-saving solution (for both sides) on Iran’s nuclear program.	最后，因为温和派的鲁哈尼目前担任总统，美国的军事打击可能破坏美伊双方就伊朗核计划达成能为双方保存颜面的方案的黄金机会。
Both Iran and the US consider the use of weapons of mass destruction a grave crime.	伊朗和美国都认为使用大规模杀伤性武器是一种严重的罪行。
Indeed, Iran was a major victim of chemical-weapons attacks during its 1980-1988 war with Saddam Hussein’s Iraq.	事实上，伊朗曾经是1980-1988年与萨达姆·侯赛因的两伊战争中化学武器袭击的主要受害者。
Iran can be a major partner to halt proliferation of WMDs in Syria, the Middle East, and beyond.	伊朗可以成为制止大规模杀伤性武器在叙利亚、中东和全世界扩散的主要合作伙伴。
Iran maintains that the Security Council is the only body legally authorized to verify allegations concerning the use of such deadly weapons and to decide on the appropriate response.	伊朗认为安理会是验证与使用上述致命武器相关指控并决定合理对策的唯一的合法授权机构。
One promising avenue for US-Iran cooperation on Syria could be joint support for a fact-finding mission by the Security Council to identify the perpetrators.	美伊就叙利亚问题合作的唯一正当途径是联合支持安理会事实调查团，明确真正的肇事者。
Obama has his “red line” on the use of chemical weapons.	奥巴马的“红线”是不容许使用化学武器。
So does Khamenei.	哈梅内伊也同样如此。
	
Why Pay More for Fairness?	为何为公平多付钱？
Marks & Spencer, a supermarket and clothing chain with 400 stores throughout Britain, recently announced that it is converting its entire range of coffee and tea, totaling 38 lines, to Fairtrade, a marketing symbol of “ethical production.”	玛科斯和斯宾塞是一家超级市场和服装连锁店，在英国具有400家分店。 它最近宣布将把它整个咖啡和茶产品总计38条线转到公平贸易。
The chain already sells only Fairtrade tea and coffee in its 200 Café Revive coffee shops.	公平贸易是“符合伦理产品”的市场营销标志。 这家连锁店已经在其200个“咖啡馆复兴”咖啡店中只销售公平贸易的茶和咖啡。
It is also boosting its purchases of shirts and other goods made with Fairtrade cotton.	它还大幅增加购买使用公平贸易棉花的衬衣和其他产品。
The announcement came during “Fairtrade Fortnight,” a two-week promotion of Fairtrade products that included speaking tours by farmers from developing countries, telling Britons how Fairtrade has assisted their communities.	这一宣布是在“公平贸易双周”期间作出的。 这一双周活动促进公平贸易产品，包括来自发展中国家的农民的演讲，他们告诉英国人公平贸易如何援助了他们的社区。
The movement toward more ethical consumption has made significant gains in the United States as well, as consumers increasingly turn to organic, locally produced foods, and eggs from hens not kept in cages.	随着美国的消费者们愈发购买有机的和当地生产的食品以及不是由在笼子里的鸡产下的鸡蛋，这一朝向更为符合伦理消费的运动在那里也取得了重大进展。
In the UK, a survey has found that half of those shown the Fairtrade symbol recognized it and understood that it refers to products that give a better deal for Third World farmers.	在英国，一项调查显示，看到公平贸易标志的人有一半认识这一标志而且知道它指的是能够给第三世界的农民带来更多利益的产品。
There is no comparable US research, but related data, and discussions with my own students, suggests that the figure would be much lower.	在美国并没有类似的研究，但是相关数据以及和我自己的学生们的讨论可以显示这一数字要低很多。
Traders seeking Fairtrade certification must pay producers a price that covers the costs of sustainable production and provides a living wage.	想要公平贸易认证的贸易商必须给生产者支付能够涵盖可持续生产成本并且提供生活必要工资的价格。
For example, the minimum price for coffee is $1.26 per pound, no matter how low the market price may fall.	例如，无论市场价格如何下跌，咖啡的最低价格都是每磅1.26美元。
If the market price rises above that figure, the fair trade price will increase so that it remains five cents per pound higher.	如果市场价格高于这一数字，那么，公平贸易的价格也将上升，高于市场价格每磅5分钱。
Small farmers, for their part, are required to be organized in cooperatives or other groups that allow democratic participation.	对于小农场主而言，他们必须以合作社或者其他组织等允许民主参与的形式组织起来。
Plantations and factories can use the Fairtrade label if they pay their workers decent wages, comply with health, safety, and environmental standards, allow unions or other forms of workers’ associations, provide good housing if workers are not living at home, and do not use child labor or forced labor.	农业种植园以及工厂如果给工人支付合理的工资、符合医疗、安全以及环境标准、允许工会或者其他形式的工人社团、为不在家居住的工人提供良好的宿舍以及不使用童工或强迫劳工的话，就可以使用公平贸易标志。
Not every one approves of Fairtrade.	并非所有人都赞同公平贸易。
Brink Lindsey, director of the pro-market Cato Institute’s Center for Trade Policy Studies, believes that the campaign for Fairtrade coffee is a “well-meaning dead end.”	亲市场的卡托贸易政策研究中心主任林德赛认为，为公平贸易咖啡造势是一个“用心良苦的死胡同 ” 。
With some justification, he argues that the real cause of the fall in coffee prices was not the profiteering of multinationals, but big increases in coffee production in Brazil and Vietnam, combined with new techniques that make it possible to grow coffee with less labor and hence more cheaply.	他不无道理地指出，咖啡价格下跌的真正原因并非是跨国公司的巧取豪夺，而是巴西和越南咖啡产量的激增，加之新技术可以让使用较少的劳力进而更低的价格成为可能。
In Lindsey’s view, if we want to assist coffee growers, we should encourage them either to abandon coffee and produce more profitable crops – and here he rightly points to rich nations’ trade barriers and subsidies as obstacles that must be dismantled – or to move into higher-value products, like specialty coffees, that bring higher prices.	根据林德赛的观点，如果我们想要援助咖啡种植者，那么我们就应当鼓励他们要么放弃种植咖啡并且生产更为有利可图的作物（他在这一点上正确地指出了富有国家的贸易壁垒以及补贴等障碍必须解除 ） ， 要么转向可以得到更高价格的更高价值的产品，例如特色咖啡。
What is curious about Lindsey’s argument, however, is that the Fairtrade coffee campaign can be seen as doing just what he recommends – encouraging coffee farmers to produce a specialty coffee that brings a higher price.	但是，林德赛主张的奇怪一面是，公平贸易咖啡运动就是在做他所推荐的事情，也就是鼓励咖啡农场主们生产可以带来更高价格的特色咖啡。
Pro-market economists don’t object to corporations that blatantly use snob appeal to promote their products.	亲市场的经济学家们并不反对公司用招摇的手段吸引势利的顾客来对其产品加以促销。
If people want to pay $48 for a pound of Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee because that’s what James Bond prefers, economists don’t object that the market is being distorted.	如果人们由于帮德喜欢牙买加蓝山咖啡而愿意花48美元一磅购买的话，经济学家并不因市场受到扭曲而加以反对。
So why be critical when consumers choose to pay $12 for a pound of coffee that they know has been grown without toxic chemicals, under shade trees that help birds to survive, by farmers who can now afford to feed and educate their children?	那么，如果消费者们花12美元一磅购买他们知道由现在可以供得起他们的孩子们上学的农民们采用无毒化学品、在让鸟类存活的绿茵树下种植的咖啡时，经济学家们为什么要提出批评呢？
Economists might reply that if you want to help people feed and educate their children, you can pay $10 for a pound of non-Fairtrade coffee that tastes the same and give the $2 you save to an aid agency that provides food and education to poor children.	经济学家们可能会说，如果你想要帮助农民养育他们的孩子并且供他们上学的话，你可以花10美元一磅来购买味道一样的非公平贸易的咖啡并且把你节省下来的2美元交给为贫困儿童提供食品和教育的援助机构。
That’s a possible strategy, but there are advantages to Fairtrade.	这一战略是可能的，但是，公平贸易是有利可图的。
The growers know that they have to provide a product that consumers like, both for its taste and for the way it is grown.	种植者们知道，他们必须提供一种为消费者们所喜欢的产品，不仅是味道，而且种植方式也要如此。
If their product sells well, they can take pride in having produced something that is sought after around the world.	如果他们的产品畅销，他们就可以因为提供了一种在全世界热销的产品而自豪。
From the growers’ perspective, receiving a premium by selling a Fairtrade product is preferable to receiving a charitable handout that they would get whether they worked or not and regardless of the quality of what they produce.	从种植者的角度而言，通过销售平贸易产品而得到溢价要比无论他们是否工作或者他们的产品质量如何而得到慈善捐助更为可取。
Paying more for a Fairtrade label is no more “anti-market” than paying more for a Gucci label, and it reflects better ethical priorities.	为公平贸易标签支付更多的钱并不比为Gucci品牌多付钱更为“非市场化 ” ， 而且它反映的是更好的伦理取向。
Fairtrade is not a government subsidy.	公平贸易并非一种政府补贴。
Its success depends on market demand, not political lobbying.	它的成功取决于市场需求，而非政治游说。
Fortunately, in Europe, that market demand is growing rapidly.	幸运的是，这一市场需求正在欧洲快速增长。
One hopes that it will soon reach similar levels throughout the developed world, and wherever people can make choices about their discretionary spending.	人们希望在所有发达国家以及在人们对他们自主决定的消费中都能够达到相似的水平。
	
The Populist War Against Intelligence	情报民粹主义战争
ATLANTA – Despite his seemingly limitless capacity for vindictiveness, it would be a mistake to interpret US President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the security clearance of former CIA director John Brennan as only his latest vendetta for lèse-majesté.	亚特兰大—尽管美国总统特朗普破坏力无穷，但认为他决定撤销对中央情报局前局长约翰·布雷南（John Brennan）的忠诚调查只是其报复大不敬的最新例子是一个错误。
True, Brennan has all but labeled Trump and his behavior, including his Russian connections, a national security threat.	诚然，布雷南给特朗普和他的行为 — — 包括与俄罗斯的关系 — — 贴上了国家安全威胁的标签。
But Trump’s move is more than personal payback.	但特朗普的行动更多的是个人报复。
As the most recent blow in his two-year-long attack on the intelligence community, his slap at Brennan is a harbinger of more to come as he tries to bring his espionage agencies to heel.	这是他两年来攻击情报界的最新动作，羞辱布雷南预示着他还会采取更多行动让情报机构屈服。
More ominously for the health of the democracies of the West, other populists are following Trump’s example.	对西方民主的健康来说，更险恶的迹象是其他民粹主义者正在效仿特朗普的榜样。
In Europe, a variety of right-wing parties, having now found themselves in power, are taking on former government antagonists, who have monitored and policed their extremism for decades.	在欧洲，众多已经掌权的右翼政党反击几十年来监控和管制他们的极端主义的前政府。
In Austria, the country’s populist leaders have been intimidating, muzzling, and purging the country’s intelligence services.	在奥地利，民粹主义领导人一直在恐吓、封口和清洗情报机关。
In February, on orders from the populist interior minister, Austrian police raided the country’s main intelligence agency – the very organization charged with monitoring right-wing extremism.	2月，在民粹主义内政部长的命令下，奥地利警方突击搜查了奥地利主要情报机关 — — 负责监控右翼极端主义的组织。
(It should be recalled that the Freedom Party, the coalition partner in Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz’s government, was founded by ex-SS officers).	（有必要回忆一下，奥地利总理库尔茨政府的执政伙伴自由党便是由前SS官员创建。 ）
And what was the pretext for the raid and subsequent demotion of senior Austrian intelligence officials?	突击检查和随后对奥地利情报高官的降级的借口是什么？
That the agency was running an operation aimed at harming North Korea.	该机关正在实施旨在危害朝鲜的行动。
No doubt, Trump wishes that he could pull off such a stunt, and both halt the investigation of him led by Robert Mueller and bring to heel all of the US intelligence agencies.	毫无疑问，特朗普也想着自己能够完成这样的“壮举 ” ， 既中止罗伯特·穆勒（Robert Mueller）领衔的对他的调查，又让美国情报机关屈服于自己。
A fan of strongman leaders who “get it done,” Trump admires diktats and brazen contempt for legal processes.	作为一个“搞定它”的强人领袖的崇拜者，特朗普渴望绝对权威，无耻地无视法律程序。
He almost certainly will pay even closer attention as the intelligence-fueled investigations into his presidential campaign’s possible collusion with Moscow in 2016 close in on him.	他几乎肯定会更加关注此事，因为情报导致他遭到对其2016年竞选活动与莫斯科的可能的勾结的调查，令他十分难堪。
It is this combination of self-interest and contempt for law that makes Trump’s revocation of the Brennan’s security clearance so troubling.	这一自利和蔑视法律的组合让特朗普撤销布雷南的忠诚调查的决定变得很有问题。
The regulations governing clearances are straightforward: the president has the power to deny access to official secrets if someone is found to have compromised classified information or is at risk of doing so.	关于忠诚调查的规定非常直白：如果某人被发现曾经泄露机密信息或有可能这样做，总统有权取消他接触官方机密的权利。
By all accounts, Brennan has done nothing of the sort.	不管从哪个角度看，布雷南都没有做过这种事。
In fact, Trump admits that.	事实上，特朗普也承认这一点。
Buried in the explanatory word salad that accompanied the revocation of Brennan’s security clearance, the White House claimed that Brennan’s “erratic” behavior was the cause.	撤销布雷南忠诚调查的决定带来了无数风言风语，遭到口诛笔伐的白宫宣称这是布雷南的“古怪”行为导致的。
That accusation would be laughable if it wasn’t so serious.	这简直贻笑大方。
Trump has simply ignored the laws – including laws governing the US intelligence services – that he swore faithfully to execute.	特朗普根本无视他宣誓效忠的法律 — — 包括管理美国情报机构的法律。
Eleven former CIA directors and deputy directors, as well as 70 former senior CIA officers (including me), said as much last week, criticizing the unprecedented revocation as political coercion and accusing Trump of misusing presidential powers, damaging national security, and threatening current and former officials’ right of free speech.	十一位中央情报局前局长和副局长，以及70 为中央情报局前高级官员（包括我 ） ， 在上周都发声批评这一前所未有的撤销忠诚调查的行为属于政治压迫，并指责特朗普滥用总统权力，危害国家安全，威胁现任和前任官员的言论自由。
As if to underscore the point, White House spokespeople say that Trump intends to order more revocations, including a former national security adviser and deputy attorney general, as well as former directors of national intelligence, the CIA and the National Security Agency.	好像觉得这还不够分量，白宫发言人表示特朗普准备下达更多撤销令，包括一位前国家安全顾问和司法部副部长，以及中央情报局和国家安全局等情报机关的前主管。
The hit list is no coincidence.	这份打击名单绝非巧合。
Those in the crosshairs have overseen intelligence collection and analysis that informed the intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, including possible collusion with Trump’s presidential campaign.	其对准的目标所负责的情报收集和分析工作让情报机关认定俄罗斯干预了2016年总统竞选，并且可能与特朗普的竞选活动勾结。
With attacks on the intelligence and law enforcement communities playing well among his supporters, Trump could well double down on this demagoguery.	特朗普的支持者很吃特朗普攻击情报和执法部门这一套，因此特朗普很可能会变本加厉散播谣言。
But his willingness to use his presidential powers as a blatantly partisan political weapon breaks ground that no American should want him to tread.	但他将总统权力赤裸裸地用于政治党争越过了没有一个美国人认为他可以跨越的边界。
The damage that has resulted from the raid in Austria shows why.	奥地利突袭情报机关所带来的后果说明了原因。
While Austrian courts ultimately will determine the raid’s legality, the effects are already clear.	尽管突袭合法性需要法院来裁定，但其后果已经显而易见。
By stripping Austria’s spies of their files, the raid has essentially put the intelligence service out of operation and raised doubts among allied intelligence services about the Austrians’ reliability.	突袭卷走了奥地利间谍的档案，让情报机关行动陷入了瘫痪，也让盟友情报机关质疑奥地利的可靠性。
Internal operations are dead in the water, as is intelligence sharing with European counterparts.	内部运行一潭死水，与欧洲情报机关的情报共享亦然。
Washington is not Vienna, but the parallels deserve close attention nonetheless.	华盛顿不是维也纳，但相似性仍然值得密切注意。
Trump’s attacks on the intelligence community and its former leaders are unprecedented, and it would be naive not to consider their impact, not only on the current intelligence leadership but also on the rank-and-file officers that do the difficult and often dangerous work of intelligence gathering and analysis.	特朗普对情报机关及其前领导人的攻击是前所未有的，不考虑其影响 — — 不仅仅是对现任情报领导人，也包括从事艰苦的、常常也很危险的情报搜集和分析工作的普通工作者 — — 将失之天真。
That is why it is so important to adhere to the laws that empower (and constrain) intelligence agencies and that underpin the political independence and integrity of their officers.	因此，必须遵守法律并赋权（和约束）情报机关，支持情报官员的政治独立性和诚信。
Events in Austria should be a warning.	奥地利发生的事情应该成为警示。
For democracies to thrive, government must be transparent as well as publicly accountable.	民主要想繁荣，政府就必须透明并接受公众问责。
When it comes to overseeing intelligence agencies pledged to protect their sources and methods, the challenges are obvious.	对于承诺保护信息源和手段的情报机构的监管工作，挑战是显而易见的。
But so, too, are the threats, including to the democratic process itself, when politicians violate rather than respect the rules that govern their intelligence services’ integrity.	但威胁也是显而易见的，如果政客违反而不是尊重管理情报机构诚信问题的规则，民主程序本身也将受到威胁。
In the final analysis, Brennan isn’t the only victim of Trump’s unwarranted and vindictive action.	在最后的分析中，布雷南不是特朗普子虚乌有的报复行动的唯一受害者。
So are all Americans when national leaders put their own interests above those of the country and corrupt the political system they are sworn to defend.	当国家领导人将个人利益置于国家利益之上、侵蚀他们宣誓要捍卫的政治制度时，全体美国人都是受害者。
	
Why Putin Makes a Bad Ally	普京为什么是糟糕的盟友
STANFORD – Russian President Vladimir Putin’s intervention in the Syrian conflict has been welcomed by some as a moment for the Kremlin to “come in from the cold.”	斯坦福 — — 俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京对叙利亚冲突的干预一直深受某些人的欢迎，认为这是克里姆林宫“摆脱孤立”的时刻。
Russia’s conflict with the Islamic State, the argument goes, has aligned the country’s interests with those of the West.	这种观点认为俄罗斯与伊斯兰国的冲突已经把俄罗斯的利益绑在了西方的战车上。
Even Turkey’s downing of a Russian warplane does not seem not to have deflated this optimism.	就连土耳其击落俄罗斯战机似乎也没有让这种乐观情绪受到影响。
Indeed, at a recent press conference, US President Barack Obama again urged Putin to join the alliance against the Islamic State.	事实上，在最近一次新闻发布会上，美国总统奥巴马再次敦促普京加入反对伊斯兰国的联盟。
And French President François Hollande billed his recent visit to Moscow as an effort to build a broad international coalition against the terrorist group.	而法国总统奥朗德则将不久前对莫斯科的访问标榜为试图建立反对恐怖组织的广泛的国际联盟。
At first blush, the idea that Russia is a natural ally against Islamist terrorists seems to make sense.	乍一看，俄罗斯是打击伊斯兰恐怖分子天然盟友的说法似乎颇有道理。
The country has suffered horrific terrorist attacks by Islamist extremists, including the bombing in November of a plane above the Sinai Peninsula, which killed 224 passengers and crew, nearly all of them Russian.	该国遭受过伊斯兰极端分子可怕的恐怖主义袭击，其中包括十一月西奈半岛上空发生的飞机爆炸，造成224名乘客和机组人员死亡，几乎所有人都是俄罗斯公民。
Around 20 million Muslims, most of them Sunni, live within the Russian Federation, and the country’s security officials report that some 7,000 fighters from the former Soviet republics and Russia have joined the Islamic State.	约有2，000万穆斯林，多数是逊尼派，在俄罗斯联邦境内生活，据该国安全官员报告，来自前苏联加盟共和国和俄罗斯的大约7，000名武装人员已经加入了伊斯兰国。
On deeper examination, however, it becomes clear that an anti-terror alliance with Russia is wishful thinking.	但只要深入分析形势，就会明白与俄罗斯建立反恐联盟不过是一厢情愿的想法。
Putin has not gone into Syria to defeat the Islamic State.	普京进入叙利亚不是为击败伊斯兰国。
He has intervened to save the regime of Russia’s client, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.	他的介入是为挽救俄国的附庸政权，叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德。
Putin may sometimes give the appearance that he is ready to abandon Assad, but ultimately he will defend him.	普京有时可能看似做好了放弃阿萨德的准备，但最终他会保护阿萨德。
Leaving Assad to his fate would be a sign of weakness – and thus anathema to Putin.	让阿萨德听任命运的安排将是一种软弱的表现 — — 因此对普京来讲根本无法接受。
Ordinary Russians may be in danger of attacks by Islamic extremists, but they pose little threat to Putin or his allies.	普通俄国人可能会受到伊斯兰极端分子的袭击，但他们对普京及其盟友构不成太大的威胁。
Russia has indeed suffered a number of terrorist attacks, including the 2004 Beslan massacre, in which 334 people, most of them schoolchildren, were killed.	俄罗斯实际上的确遭遇了若干次恐怖袭击，包括2004年的别斯兰惨案，造成334人，多数是学生死亡。
In nearly every case, the response to the attacks was brutal, inept, and costly in terms of civilian lives lost.	几乎在所有情况下，对袭击采取的反制措施都残酷、无能，让民众付出了惨重的生命代价。
And yet the Putin regime has emerged unscathed each time.	但每次普京政权却都能安然渡过、毫发无伤。
Indeed, terrorist attacks at the turn of the century solidified public opinion against Chechen rebels and gave Putin the public support he needed to raze Grozny, Chechnya’s capital.	事实上，发生在世纪之交的恐怖袭击巩固了反对车臣叛军的公众舆论，并赋予了普京夷平车臣首都格罗兹尼所需的公众支持。
Putin’s confidence in dealing with terrorism reflects the design of Russia’s security state.	普京应对恐怖主义的信心反映了俄罗斯的安全国家设计。
Russia spends more on internal security than it does on national defense.	俄国在国内安全上的开支甚至超过国家防御。
It has interior ministry troops, federal security agency (FSB) special forces, OMON (mobile special service) troops, military intelligence troops, and a vast network of internal spies and informants.	它组建了内政部部队、联邦安全局（FSB）特种部队，内政部特种（机动特服）部队、军事情报部队和由国内间谍和线人组成的庞大网络。
Regime opponents are not allowed to run for office, their rights to demonstrate are restricted, and they are subject to a legal arbitrariness in the courts.	政权反对者不得竞选公职，他们的示威权利受到限制，并在法庭面对法律强制。
Citizens have virtually no protection from wiretaps or the interception of their electronic communications.	公民的谈话遭到监听，他们的电子邮件遭到拦截。
Every society must balance civil rights against national security.	所有社会都必须平衡国家安全和公民权利。
Putin’s Russia has swung to one extreme of the spectrum, while the United States and Europe (despite the protests of civil libertarians) have chosen to occupy the other end.	普京的俄罗斯走到了其中一个极端，而美国和欧洲（尽管不时发生公民自由抗议活动）则选择了相反的一头。
Indeed, Russia is an example of the upper limit of what state power can do to control terrorist activity.	事实上，俄罗斯代表了国家政权控制恐怖活动所能达到的上限。
It would be a rare extremist group that had not been infiltrated with an informant who reports to Moscow.	鲜有极端主义团体从未被向莫斯科汇报的线人渗透。
There is even evidence that those who carried out the Beslan massacre were infiltrated by Russian intelligence.	甚至有证据表明别斯兰惨案的制造者也已遭到俄罗斯情报部门的渗透。
Moreover, any terrorist group knows that their operations will be met with the most extreme use of force.	此外，任何恐怖组织都知道他们的行动将遭到极端的武力镇压。
In Beslan, for example, Russian special forces used thermobaric weapons.	比方说在别斯兰，俄罗斯特种部队就使用燃料空气弹作为武器。
As the reaction to the attacks in Paris illustrates, the seemingly random murder of 130 civilians has monumental resonance in the West – especially when the religious and ideological motives are difficult to understand.	对巴黎袭击事件的反应说明，貌似随意的130名平民屠杀事件却在西方掀起了巨大的波澜 — — 尤其当宗教和意识形态动机很难理解的时候。
But the Kremlin places a lower value on human lives than Western societies do.	但克里姆林宫不像西方社会那样珍视人的生命。
In Putin’s calculations, the loss of lives in extremist attacks is unwelcome, but ultimately acceptable if it does not threaten the regime.	在普京看来，极端分子袭击造成人员伤亡令人不快，但如果不威胁政权那么最终可以接受。
The Russian people might be horrified and frightened.	俄罗斯民众可能感到非常惊恐。
But the Russian regime is primarily concerned with its own survival – and with how it might use the public’s horror to its benefit.	但俄罗斯政权主要关心其自身的生存 — — 以及如何利用公众恐惧为自己谋求好处。
Working with the West to combat the Islamic State serves neither of those purposes.	与西方合作打击伊斯兰国不符合他们的目标。
	
Hard to be Easing	难以宽松
NEW YORK – The United States Federal Reserve’s decision to undertake a third round of quantitative easing, or QE3, has raised three important questions. Will QE3 jump-start America’s anemic economic growth?	发自纽约 — — 美联储实施第三轮量化宽松（QE3）的决定引出了三大重要问题：QE3能否紧急启动美国当前乏力的经济增长？
Will it lead to a persistent increase in risky assets, especially in US and other global equity markets?	它是否会导致风险资产的持续增长，尤其是在美国以及其他全球股票市场？
Finally, will its effects on GDP growth and equity markets be similar or different?	最后，其对GDP增长和股票市场的影响将会相似还是有所不同？
Many now argue that QE3’s effect on risky assets should be as powerful, if not more so, than that of QE1, QE2, and “Operation Twist,” the Fed’s earlier bond-purchase program.	许多人如今认为QE3对风险资产的影响应该与第一轮（QE1 ） ， 第二轮量化宽松（QE2）以及美联储早前的债券购买计划“扭曲操作（Operation Twist ） ” 具备同样威力（如果不是更大的话 ） 。
After all, while the previous rounds of US monetary easing have been associated with a persistent increase in equity prices, the size and duration of QE3 are more substantial.	毕竟以股票价格计算的话，QE3的规模和持续时间都更具实质性。
But, despite the Fed’s impressive commitment to aggressive monetary easing, its effects on the real economy and on US equities could well be smaller and more fleeting than those of previous QE rounds.	但尽管美联储实施积极货币宽松的许诺非常引人注目，但此举对实体经济和美股的影响可能比前两轮的都要更小也更短暂。
Consider, first, that the previous QE rounds came at times of much lower equity valuations and earnings.	首先，考虑到以往的宽松政策都是在股票估值和收益都更加低的时候推出。
In March 2009, the S&P 500 index was down to 660, earnings per share (EPS) of US companies and banks had sunk to a financial-crisis low, and price/earnings ratios were in the single digits.	在2009年3月，标准普尔500指数下跌到660点，美国企业和银行的每股收益率都降到了危机以来的最低点，市盈率降到了单数。
Today, the S&P 500 is more than 100% higher (hovering near 1,430), the average EPS is close to $100, and P/E ratios are above 14.	如今，标准普尔500指数已经翻了超过一番（接近1430点 ） ， 平均每股收益率约有100美元，市盈率超过了14。
Even during QE2, in the summer of 2010, the S&P 500, P/E ratios, and EPS were much lower than they are today.	即便是2010年夏的QE2期间，标普500指数，市盈率和每股收益率都比今天要低得多。
If, as is likely, economic growth in the US remains anemic in spite of QE3, top-line revenues and bottom-line earnings will turn south, with negative effects on equity valuations.	倘若（而且很可能）美国的经济增长在QE3之下依然疲软，营业收入和实际利润将下降，并对股票估值也会产生负面的影响。
Moreover, fiscal support is absent this time: QE1 and QE2 helped to prevent a deeper recession and avoid a double dip, respectively, because each was associated with a significant fiscal stimulus.	此外，本次宽松也缺乏财政支持：QE1和QE2分别防止了陷入更严重衰退并阻以及二次下滑，因为每次宽松都是与一个大型财政刺激计划联系在一起的。
In contrast, QE3 will be associated with a fiscal contraction, possibly even a large fiscal cliff.	相比之下，QE3将会与一轮财政收紧联系在一起，甚至很可能是一场财政大幅削减。
Even if the US avoids the full fiscal cliff of 4.5% of GDP that is looming at the end of the year, it is highly likely that a fiscal drag amounting to 1.5% of GDP will hit the economy in 2013.	即便美国避免了可能在今年年末出现的相当于GDP4.5%的全面财政削减，也很有可能会有一场相当于GDP1.5%的财政拖累来对2013年的经济造成打击。
With the US economy currently growing at a 1.6% annual rate, a fiscal drag of even 1% implies near-stagnation in 2013, though a modest recovery in housing and manufacturing, together with QE3, should keep US growth at about its current level in 2013.	美国经济目前的年均增长为1.6 % ， 即便住宅和制造业都已经出现温和复苏，加上QE3，都能将美国2013年的增长保持在这一水平，但即便是1%的财政拖累都将意味着经济增长会在2013年近乎停滞。
But there is no broader rebound underway.	但目前没有更大范围的反弹出现。
In both 2010 and 2011, leading economic indicators showed that the first-half slowdown had bottomed out, and that growth was already accelerating before the announcement of monetary easing.	在2010和2011年，一些前导经济指数显示上半年的经济放缓已经触底反弹，且增长在货币宽松宣布之前就已经开始加速。
Thus, QE nudged along an economy that was already recovering, which prolonged asset reflation.	因此当时宽松助推了一个已经开始复苏的经济，并因此延长了资产的再膨胀。
By contrast, the latest data suggest that the US economy is performing as sluggishly now as it was in the first half of the year.	相比之下，最近的数据显示美国当前的经济表现正如上半年一样步履维艰。
Indeed, if anything, weakness in the US labor market, low capital expenditures, and slow income growth have contradicted signals in the early summer that third-quarter growth might be more robust.	事实上，更可能表现出来的是，美国劳动力市场的疲软，低资本支出以及缓慢的收入增长都反映出第三季度是不可能出现更强劲增长的。
Meanwhile, the main transmission channels of monetary stimulus to the real economy – the bond, credit, currency, and stock markets – remain weak, if not broken.	与此同时，货币刺激向实体经济传导的主要渠道 — — 债券，信贷，货币和股票市场 — — 都依然疲软 — — 如果不是千疮白孔的话。
Indeed, the bond-market channel is unlikely to boost growth.	事实上，债券市场渠道不太可能去刺激增长。
Long-term government bond yields are already very low, and a further reduction will not significantly change private agents’ borrowing costs.	长期政府债券收益已经非常低下，即便进一步下调，也不会对私人机构的借贷成本产生太大影响。
The credit channel also is not working properly, as banks have hoarded most of the extra liquidity from QE, creating excess reserves rather than increasing lending.	而信贷渠道同样不甚通畅，因为银行已经囤积了来自量化宽松的大部分额外流动性，不但没有增加贷款，反而还产生了多余的储备。
Those who can borrow have ample cash and are cautious about spending, while those who want to borrow – highly indebted households and firms (especially small and medium-size enterprises) – face a credit crunch.	那些有资格贷款者都拥有充足的现金并小心控制支出，而那些急需贷款者 — — 高负债的家庭和企业（尤其是中小企业 ） — —都在面对着信贷紧缩。
The currency channel is similarly impaired.	货币渠道同样也存在缺陷。
With global growth weakening, net exports are unlikely to improve robustly, even with a weaker dollar.	当全球增长减弱之时，即便美元贬值也难以使净出口出现极大改善。
Moreover, many major central banks are implementing variants of QE alongside the Fed, dampening the effect of the Fed’s actions on the dollar’s value.	此外，许多主要中央银行都在和美联储一样实施某些量化宽松政策的变体，抵消了美联储行动对美元价值的影响。
Perhaps most important, a weaker dollar’s effect on the trade balance, and thus on growth, is limited by two factors.	或许更重要的是，一个弱势美元对贸易平衡的作用以及因此对增长的影响会受到两个因素的限制。
First, a weaker dollar is associated with a higher dollar price for commodities, which implies a drag on the trade balance, because the US is a net commodity-importing country.	首先，一个弱势美元是与一个更高的大宗商品美元采购价格联系在一起的，而这也意味着会对贸易平衡产生拖累，因为美国是一个大宗商品的净进口国。
Second, any improvement in GDP derived from stronger exports leads to an increase in imports.	其二，任何源自于更强劲出口的GDP改善都会引发进口增加。
Empirical studies estimate that the overall impact of a weaker US dollar on the trade balance is close to zero.	观察研究预计弱势美元对贸易平衡的总体影响接近于零。
The only other significant channel to transmit QE to the real economy is the wealth effect of an equity-market increase, but there is some circularity in the argument that QE3 will lead to a persistent rise in equity prices.	量化宽松向实体经济传导的另外唯一一个重要渠道就是股市上涨所带来的财富效应，但在QE3将引发股票价格持续上涨的观点中存在着某种自相矛盾的东西。
If persistent asset reflation requires a significant GDP growth recovery, it is tautological to say that if equity prices rise enough following QE, the resulting increase in GDP from a wealth effect justifies the rise in asset prices.	如果持续的资产再膨胀需要GDP增长显著复苏来实现的话，那么声称如果股票价格能在量化宽松之后出现足够上涨，而因此产生的由财富效应所引发的GDP上涨就证明资产价格上升是合理的说法就是一个有逻辑的废话罢了。
If monetary policy’s transmission channels to the real economy are broken, one cannot assume that QE will have a significant effect on economic growth.	如果货币政策向实体经济的传导渠道出了问题，人们也不能假设量化宽松会对经济增长产生较大影响。
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has recently emphasized the importance of an additional channel: the confidence channel, through which the Fed’s commitment to maintaining generous monetary conditions for longer could improve private spending.	美联储主席本·伯南克最近强调了另一条额外渠道的重要性：信心渠道，美联储维持大量货币供应状况的承诺可以改善私人消费。
The issue is how substantial and durable such effects will be.	问题是这些措施就能有多大实质性，又能维持多长时间？
Confidence is fragile in an environment characterized by ongoing deleveraging, macro uncertainties, weak labor-market growth, and a fiscal drag.	在一个不断去杠杆化，充满宏观不确定因素，劳动市场增长疲弱以及财政拖累的现状下，信心是极为脆弱的。
In short, QE3 reduces the tail risk of an outright economic contraction, but is unlikely to lead to a sustained recovery in an economy that is still enduring a painful deleveraging process.	简而言之，QE3减少了立刻出现经济收缩的尾部风险，但也不可能为一个依然承受着痛苦去杠杆化过程的经济体立刻带来持续复苏。
In the short run, QE3 will lead investors to take on risk, and will stimulate modest asset reflation.	在短期内，QE3会令投资者敢于承担风险，并会刺激温和的资产价格再膨胀。
But the equity-price rise is likely to fizzle out over time if economic growth disappoints, as is likely, and drags down expectations about corporate revenues and profitability.	但如果经济增长令人失望的话 — — 这情况很可能出现，股票价格的上升也会随着时间逐渐消弭，并拖低对企业收入和盈利的预期。
	
Quantitative Quicksand	量化流沙
PITTSBURGH – Almost all recoveries from recession have included rapid employment growth – until now.	匹兹堡—几乎所有衰退后的复苏都伴随着快速的就业增长 — — 目前除外。
Though advanced-country central banks have pursued expansionary monetary policy in the wake of the global economic crisis in an effort to boost demand, job creation has lagged.	尽管发达国家央行面对全球经济危机采取了扩张性货币政策以提振需求，就业创造始终萎靡不振。
As a result, workers, increasingly convinced that they will be unable to find employment for a sustained period, are leaving the labor force in droves.	结果，日益感到自己无法找到持续工作的工人正在陆续离开劳动力市场。
Nowhere is this phenomenon more pronounced than in the United States, where the Federal Reserve has reduced interest rates to unprecedented levels and, through quantitative easing (QE), augmented bank reserves by purchasing financial assets.	这一现象在美国最为明显，美联储将利率降至前所未有的低水平，并通过量化宽松购买金融资产从而扩大了银行准备金。
But inflation – which rapid money-supply expansion inevitably fuels – has so far remained subdued, at roughly 2%, because banks are not using their swelling reserves to expand credit and increase liquidity.	但通货膨胀 — — 应该是快速货币供给扩张的必然结果 — — 至今仍然不见起色，维持在2%左右，这是因为银行并没有用增加的准备金扩大信用、增加流动性。
While this is keeping price volatility in check, it is also hindering employment growth.	尽管这让物价免于波动，但也阻碍了就业增长。
Rather than changing its approach, however, the Fed has responded to slow employment growth by launching additional rounds of QE.	但是，美联储并没有改变方针，而是以增加一轮又一轮量化宽松应对就业增长缓慢的问题。
Apparently, its rationale is that if expanding reserves by more than $2 trillion has not produced the desired results, adding $85 billion more monthly – another $1 trillion this year – might do the trick.	显然，美联储的考虑是，既然增加2万多亿美元还不能形成渴望的结果，那么每个月再增加850亿美元 — — 今年再增1万亿 — — 可能就会有所成效吧。
America’s central bankers need not search far to find out why QE is not working; evidence is published regularly for anyone to see.	美国的中央银行家需要花点力气找找为何量化宽松没有效果；证据一直在发表，每个人都看得见。
During QE2 (from November 2010 to July 2011), the Fed added a total of $557.9 billion to reserves, and excess reserves grew by $546.5 billion.	在第二次量化宽松（QE2，2010年11月—2011年7月）期间，美联储增加了总共5579亿美元的准备金，超额准备金增加了5465亿美元。
That means that banks circulated only 2% of QE2’s contribution, leaving the rest idle.	这意味着银行只发放了2%的QE2规模，剩下的部分都闲置着。
Similarly, since QE3 was launched last September, total bank reserves have grown by $244.1 billion, and excess reserves by $239.4 billion – meaning that 99% of the funds remain idle.	类似地，自去年9月推出第三次量化宽松（QE3）以来，银行总准备金增加了2441亿美元，超额准备金增加了2394亿美元 — — 99%的资金被闲置了。
Given that banks earn 0.25% in interest on their reserve accounts, but pay very low – indeed, near-zero – interest to their depositors, they might choose to leave the money idle, drawing risk-free interest, rather than circulate it through the economy.	银行的准备金账户可以获得0.25%的利息，而它们对储户所付出的的利息非常低（实际近于零 ） ， 它们可能选择让这些钱闲置获得无风险利息，而不是把它们注入经济中。
At current interest rates, banks lend to the government, large stable corporations, and commercial real-estate dealers; they do not extend credit to riskier borrowers, like start-up companies or first-time home buyers.	在当前利率下，银行把钱贷给政府、稳定的大公司和商业地产交易商；而不会扩大对高风险借款人的信用，比如创业公司或首次购房者。
While speculators and bankers profit from the decline in interest rates that accompanies the Fed’s asset purchases, the intended monetary and credit stimulus is absent.	投机者和银行家从美联储资产购买计划所带来的利率下降中获益，而计划中的货币和信用刺激却打了水漂。
At some point, the Fed must realize that its current policy is not working.	迟早，美联储必须认识到目前的政策是无效的。
But developing a more effective alternative requires an understanding of the US economy’s actual problems – something that the Fed also seems to lack.	但开发更有效的替代政策需要了解美国经济的核心问题 — — 这也是美联储没有做到的。
Indeed, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke often says that his goal is to prevent another Great Depression, even though the Fed addressed that risk effectively in 2008.	事实上，美联储主席伯南克经常说，他的目标是避免另一次大萧条，尽管美联储在2008年就已经打消了这一风险。
The US economy has not responded to the Fed’s monetary expansion, because America’s biggest problems are not liquidity problems.	美国经济没有响应美联储的货币扩张，因为美国最大的问题不是流动性问题。
As every economics student learns early on, monetary policy cannot fix problems in the real economy; only policy changes affecting the real economy can.	每个经济学学生很早就会学到，货币政策无法修正实体经济的问题；只有影响实体经济的政策变化可以。
The Fed should relearn that lesson.	美联储应该回去重修。
One major problem, insufficient investment, is rooted in President Barack Obama’s effort to increase the tax paid by those whose annual incomes exceed $250,000 and, more recently, in his proposal to cap retirement entitlements.	一大问题 — — 投资不足的根源是奥巴马总统试图提高年收入250000以上人群的税收以及最近的退休福利封顶方案。
While such proposals have been met with opposition, Obama cannot be expected to sign a deficit-reduction bill that does not include more revenue.	尽管这些方案遇到了反对，但奥巴马不可能签署不包括增加收入的赤字削减法案。
As long as that revenue’s sources, and the future effects of new regulations, remain uncertain, those whom the policies would most harm – the country’s largest savers – are unlikely to invest.	只要收入源以及新规则的未来影响尚不明确，受这些政策伤害最大的人群 — — 美国最大的储蓄者 — — 就不可能投资。
Likewise, Obama’s health-care reform, the Affordable Care Act, has hampered employment growth, as businesses reduce their hiring and cut workers’ hours to shelter themselves from increased labor costs (estimates of the rise vary).	类似地，奥巴马的医疗改革 — — 平价医疗法案（Affordable Care Act）阻碍了就业增长，因为企业减少了招聘，削减了工人的工时，以应对劳动力成本的上升（上升幅度估计各不相同 ） 。
Meanwhile, the faltering European economy and slowing GDP growth in China and elsewhere are impeding export demand.	与此同时，萎靡的欧洲经济和中国和其他地区GDP增长的放缓拖累了出口需求。
While subdued liquidity and credit growth are delaying the inflationary impact of the Fed’s determination to expand banks’ already-massive reserves, America cannot escape inflation forever.	尽管受抑制的流动性和信用增长推迟了美联储扩张银行已然相当庞大的准备金规模的决定的通胀性效果，但美国不可能永远逃脱通胀。
The reserves that the Fed – and almost all other major central banks – are building will eventually be used.	美联储 — — 以及几乎所有其他世界主要央行 — — 所注入的准备金迟早会用起来。
	
Shinzo Abe’s Monetary-Policy Delusions	安倍晋三的货币政策迷思
NEW HAVEN – The politicization of central banking continues unabated.	发自纽黑文 — — 中央银行政治化的趋势有增无减。
The resurrection of Shinzo Abe and Japan’s Liberal Democratic Party – pillars of the political system that has left the Japanese economy mired in two lost decades and counting – is just the latest case in point.	而安倍晋三以及日本自民党的卷土重来 — — 它们都是使日本经济从20多年前至今依然陷入停滞的政治系统的核心元素 — — 只是这一现象的最新注解而已。
Japan’s recent election hinged critically on Abe’s views of the Bank of Japan’s monetary policy stance.	日本近期的选举与安倍对日本银行货币政策立场的见解紧密联系在一起。
He argued that a timid BOJ should learn from its more aggressive counterparts, the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank.	他指出过于谨慎的日本央行应该向它更为激进的同行 — — 美联储和欧洲央行 — — 学习。
Just as the Fed and the ECB have apparently saved the day through their unconventional and aggressive quantitative easing (QE), goes the argument, Abe believes it is now time for the BOJ to do the same.	而正如美联储和欧洲央行显然通过非常规且激进的量化宽松政策挽救了大局一样，安倍认为日本央行也是时候该采取相同的行动了。
It certainly looks as if he will get his way.	而如今看来安倍似乎也将如愿以偿。
With BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa’s term ending in April, Abe will be able to select a successor – and two deputy governors as well – to do his bidding.	随着日本央行行长白川方明（Masaaki Shirakawa）的任期于明年四月份届满，首相就可以另选一位继任者 — — 以及两个副行长 — — 来执行他的命令。
But will it work?	但这种政策能起作用吗？
While experimental monetary policy is now widely accepted as standard operating procedure in today’s post-crisis era, its efficacy is dubious.	尽管在后危机时代的今天，实验性的货币政策被当作标准的操作流程进得到大范围推广，但其有效性依然值得怀疑。
Nearly four years after the world hit bottom in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, QE’s impact has been strikingly asymmetric.	世界经济在全球金融危机冲击下触底后的近四年里，量化宽松政策的影响明显不对称。
While massive liquidity injections were effective in unfreezing credit markets and arrested the worst of the crisis – witness the role of the Fed’s first round of QE in 2009-2010 – subsequent efforts have not sparked anything close to a normal cyclical recovery.	大量流动性的注入的确在解冻信贷市场上取得成效并阻止了危机深度恶化 — — 这在美联储2009-2010年度首轮量化宽松政策中得到了证明 — — 然而随后的措施都未能催生任何常见的周期性复苏。
The reason is not hard to fathom.	其中原因并不难理解。
Hobbled by severe damage to private and public-sector balance sheets, and with policy interest rates at or near zero, post-bubble economies have been mired in a classic “liquidity trap.”	由于私营及公共企业的资产负债表受到严重破坏，政策利率又几近为零，后泡沫经济已经陷入了典型的“流动性陷阱 ” 。
They are more focused on paying down massive debt overhangs built up before the crisis than on assuming new debt and boosting aggregate demand.	相对于进一步举债或刺激总需求，人们更加关心如何偿还危机之前积累的巨额债务。
The sad case of the American consumer is a classic example of how this plays out.	美国消费者的悲剧正是这种政策后果的典型例子。
In the years leading up to the crisis, two bubbles – property and credit – fueled a record-high personal-consumption binge.	在危机前的几年中，两种经济泡沫 — — 房地产和信贷 — — 加剧了创纪录的个人消费热潮。
When the bubbles burst, households understandably became fixated on balance-sheet repair – namely, paying down debt and rebuilding personal savings, rather than resuming excessive spending habits.	当泡沫爆发时，不难理解每个家庭都开始关注如何改善其负债 — — 也就是偿还债务并重新开始储蓄，而不是恢复过度消费的习惯。
Indeed, notwithstanding an unprecedented post-crisis tripling of Fed assets to roughly $3 trillion – probably on their way to $4 trillion over the next year – US consumers have pulled back as never before.	确实，尽管前所未有的危机后美联储资产大概翻了三倍到3万亿美元 — — 并可能在未来一年内达到4万亿美元，美国的消费还是前所未有的回落了。
In the 19 quarters since the start of 2008, annualized growth of inflation-adjusted consumer spending has averaged just 0.7% – almost three percentage points below the 3.6% trend increases recorded in the 11 years ending in 2006.	自2008年初以来的19个季度中，计入通胀因素后消费支出的年化增长率平均仅为0.7 % — —几乎比截至2006年的前11年每年3.6%的增长趋势低了3个百分点。
Nor does the ECB have reason to be gratified with its strain of quantitative easing.	欧洲央行也没有理由为其量化宽松政策的作为而感到满意。
Despite a doubling of its balance sheet, to a little more than €3 trillion ($4 trillion), Europe has slipped back into recession for the second time in four years.	尽管它的资产翻了倍，达到3万多亿欧元（折合约4万亿美元 ） ， 欧洲已经在四年中第二次回落到衰退状态。
Not only is QE’s ability to jumpstart crisis-torn, balance-sheet-constrained economies limited; it also runs the important risk of blurring the distinction between monetary and fiscal policy.	不仅量化宽松政策重启那些饱受危机折磨且资产负债表受制的经济体的能力有限；它还冒着模糊货币政策和财政政策之间区别的重大风险。
Central banks that buy sovereign debt issued by fiscal authorities offset market-imposed discipline on borrowing costs, effectively subsidizing public-sector profligacy.	那些购买由财政当局发行的主权债务的央行逃脱了市场对借贷成本施加的约束，实际上资助了公共部门的挥霍行为。
Unfortunately, it appears that Japan has forgotten many of its own lessons – especially the BOJ’s disappointing experience with zero interest rates and QE in the early 2000’s.	不幸地是，日本似乎忘了自身所经历的许多教训 — — 尤其是日本央行在2000年代实施零利率和量化宽松政策的沮丧经历。
But it has also lost sight of the 1990’s – the first of its so-called lost decades – when the authorities did all they could to prolong the life of insolvent banks and many nonfinancial corporations.	但它同时也也忘记了1990年代 — — 也是第一个所谓“失落的10年 ” — —再此期间当局尽其所能延长资不抵债的银行和许多非金融公司的寿命。
Zombie-like companies were kept on artificial life-support in the false hope that time alone would revive them.	这些行尸走肉般的公司靠着人为力量勉强继续运行，它们都抱着一种虚幻的希望 — — 时间能够拯救一切。
It was not until late in the decade, when the banking sector was reorganized and corporate restructuring was encouraged, that Japan made progress on the long, arduous road of balance-sheet repair and structural transformation.	直到这个10年的末期，当银行开始重组而且企业也被鼓励重组时，日本才在修复资产负债表和结构改革的道路上取得了进步。
US authorities have succumbed to the same Japanese-like temptations.	美国当局已经屈服于与日本一样的诱惑。
From quantitative easing to record-high federal budget deficits to unprecedented bailouts, they have done everything in their power to mask the pain of balance-sheet repair and structural adjustment.	从量化宽松政策到破纪录的联邦预算赤字都被用于前所未有的救援行动，他们用尽一切力量来掩饰资产负债表修复与结构调整所带来的痛苦。
As a result, America has created its own generation of zombies – in this case, zombie consumers.	结果，美国已经创造出了它自己的僵尸 — — 也就是僵尸消费者。
Like Japan, America’s post-bubble healing has been limited – even in the face of the Fed’s outsize liquidity injections.	跟日本一样，美国泡沫破裂后的恢复是有限的 — — 即使是在美联储注入大规模流动资金的情况下。
Household debt stood at 112% of income in the third quarter of 2012 – down from record highs in 2006, but still nearly 40 percentage points above the 75% norm of the last three decades of the twentieth century.	2012年第三季度美国家庭负债相当于收入的112 % — —虽然较2006年的创纪录高位有所回落，但仍比20世纪最后30年75%的标准高了几乎40个百分点。
Similarly, the personal-saving rate, at just 3.5% in the four months ending in November 2012, was less than half the 7.9% average of 1970-99.	同样，2012年截止到11月的后四个月中个人储蓄率仅为3.5 % ， 这还不到1970~1999年7.9%的平均储蓄率的一半。
The same is true of Europe. The ECB’s über-aggressive actions have achieved little in the way of bringing about long-awaited structural transformation in the region.	欧洲的情况也是如此，欧洲央行过于激进的行动并未在区内促成人们期待已久的结构性改革。
Crisis-torn peripheral European economies still suffer from unsustainable debt loads and serious productivity and competitiveness problems.	饱受危机折磨的欧洲外围经济体仍然面对着无法承受的债务负担和严重的生产力和竞争力问题。
And a fragmented European banking system remains one of the weakest links in the regional daisy chain.	而碎片化的欧洲银行体系仍然是区域链条中最脆弱的一环。
Is this the “cure” that Abe really wants for Japan?	这就是安倍想为日本寻求的“解决方案”吗？
The last thing that the Japanese economy needs at this point is backsliding on structural reforms.	此时日本经济最不需要的就是结构改革的倒退。
Yet, by forcing the BOJ to follow in the misdirected footsteps of the Fed and the ECB, that is precisely the risk that Abe and Japan are facing.	然而通过迫使日本央行追随美联储和欧洲央行的错误步伐，这正是安倍和日本所面临的风险。
Massive liquidity injections carried out by the world’s major central banks – the Fed, the ECB, and the BOJ – are neither achieving traction in their respective real economies, nor facilitating balance-sheet repair and structural change.	由世界主要的央行 — — 即美联储、欧洲央行、日本央行 — — 贯彻的大规模流动性注入既不能在各自的实体经济里促进交易，也不能促进资产负债表修复和结构性变革。
That leaves a huge sum of excess liquidity sloshing around in global asset markets.	这就让大量多余的流动资金在全球资本市场上流动。
Where it goes, the next crisis is inevitably doomed to follow.	不管这些资金流到何处，下一个危机也无可避免地注定随之而来。
	
Why Remember Pearl Harbor?	纪念珍珠港事件
NEW YORK – December 7 marks the 67th anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.	纽约 - - 今年12月7日是日本攻击珍珠港事件67周年纪念日。
Over the years, “the day of infamy” has become a classic reference point for galvanizing patriotic sentiment in America.	多年来，人们用这一“奇耻大辱之日”激发美国爱国情怀百试不爽。
In the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack, for example, analogies to Pearl Harbor were made frequently.	例如，在2001年9月11日恐怖主义攻击事件后，人们经常把它和珍珠港事件进行类比。
But despite its central place in America’s collective memory, Pearl Harbor remains little understood.	但是尽管珍珠港在美国人的集体记忆中占据中心地位，但是人们对它还是一知半解。
Why did Japan initiate such a seemingly self-destructive war in the first place?	日本为何进行这一看起来是自我毁灭的战争呢？
Aside from lessons that Japan must learn from its momentous decision, is there something to be learned by the United States as well?	除了日本要从这一重大决定中吸取教训之外，美国有没有经验教训要总结呢？
The decision to attack Pearl Harbor was reached after five months of deliberations that included numerous official conferences.	袭击珍珠港的决定是在经过五个月的审议后做出的，决策过程中举行了难以计数的会议。 这是一个渐进的过程。
It was a gradual process in which more sympathetic, albeit firm, US engagement might have helped sway Japan in a different direction.	在这一过程中，如果美国坚定而又富有同情地与日本接触，那么或许会把日本引向另一个方向。
In fact, Japanese government opinion was so divided that it is surprising that it was able to unite in the end.	实际上，日本政府内部观点充满分歧，最终能够团结一致实在令人惊讶。
Many in the Japanese Army initially regarded the Soviet Union as the main threat facing the country.	日本皇军有许多人把苏联视为国家面临的主要威胁。
Others saw the US as the primary enemy.	其他人则把美国视为主要敌人。
Some were concerned with more abstract, ideological enemies, such as Communism and “Americanism,” while there were also voices highlighting the menace of the “white race” (including Japan’s allies, Germany and Italy) against the “yellow race.”	有人担心更为抽象的意识形态上的敌人，例如共产主义和所谓“美国主义 ” 。 还有人则强调“白种人 ” ( 包括日本的盟国德国和意大利)对“黄种人”的威胁。
Then there were those who preferred not to fight any enemy at all, particularly the US, whose long-term war-making power, the government knew, far surpassed Japan’s own.	进而，还有人希望根本不要打仗，特别是与美国打仗。 政府知道，美国的长久作战实力远远超过日本。
The tactical mastermind of the Pearl Harbor operation, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, was one of them.	珍珠港行动的战术策划人海军上将山本五十六就是其中反对之人。
Over the course of the summer of 1941, events slowly tilted Japan towards the possibility of war with the West.	1941年夏天，各种事件逐步把日本推向与西方开战。
But Pearl Harbor was in no way inevitable.	但是袭击珍珠港决非不可避免。
Germany’s attack on the Soviet Union compelled Japan in July 1941 to prepare a plan of attack.	德国攻击苏联迫使日本在1941年准备进攻方案。
Although it made clear Japan’s desire to take advantage of the European conflict and gain a foothold in the European colonies in Southeast Asia, the plan was not clear about who constituted Japan’s true enemy.	尽管这一方案明确了日本利用欧战并且在欧洲各国在东南亚取得立足点的愿望，但是它并未明确说明谁是日本的真正敌人。
Japan’s military thrust into Southeast Asia led President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s administration to impose sanctions.	日本军队攻入东南亚导致美国总统罗斯福当局实行制裁。
The US froze Japanese assets, an example followed by Britain and the Dutch East Indies.	美国冻结了日本的资产，英国和荷属东印度也随后效仿。
When Japan responded by taking over southern French Indochina, the US retaliated by imposing an embargo on oil exports to Japan.	日本通过占领法属印度支那南部还以颜色，美国则对日本实行石油禁运予以报复。
Rather than telling Japan that the US was determined to search for a diplomatic solution, America’s categorical reaction confirmed it to the Japanese as an arrogant and conceited enemy.	美国不仅没有告诉日本它决心寻求外交解决途经，其坚硬的反应措施使得日本确信美国是一个自负的敌人。
Moreover, by transferring its Pacific Fleet from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, the US encouraged the Japanese understanding that the US fully anticipated war with Japan.	而且，美国将太平洋舰队从圣地亚哥转移到珍珠港，促使日本认为美国完全打算与日本开战。
World War II in the Pacific finally came about for many different reasons.	第二次世界大战的太平洋战争最后打响有多种不同的原因。
But it was, above all, the sense of encirclement and humiliation that united the deeply divided Japanese government.	但是首先是因为被包围感和屈辱感使得原本意见分歧严重的日本政府团结起来。
Feeling defeated by a series of failed approaches to the US, including an overture to hold direct talks with Roosevelt, Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe resigned on October 16, making hard-line Army Minister Hideki Tōjō his successor.	日本首相近卫文磨试图接近美国包括与美国总统罗斯福举行直接会谈，但是都无功而返。 他深感受挫而在10月16日辞职，把首相位子让给了强硬派陆军大臣东条英机。
The high-handed tone of the Hull Note of November 26, demanding Japan’s withdrawal of all its troops from China, was a final blow to the moderates in Japan’s government, who still hoped for diplomatic negotiations.	美国国务卿赫尔11月26日照会日本言辞高傲严厉，要求日本从中国完全撤军。 这是对依旧希望外交谈判的日本政府温和派的最后一击。
By this time, many policymakers were convinced that the US was not ready to hear them out.	到了此时，许多决策者都相信美国并不打算听取他们意见。
It was ultimately in the name of saving Asia for all Asians from what was regarded as Western arrogance that the government united to wage war.	日本政府最后以大东亚共荣、抵御洋人傲慢无理的名义联合一致开战。
On December 1, it was decided that the war would commence in six days.	12月1日，日本决定在六天内开战。
There were legitimate historical reasons for Japan to feel humiliated on the eve of war.	战前日本感觉受到屈辱是有合理历史原因的。
The gunboat diplomacy that resulted in the opening of Japan and unequal treaties in the mid-19th century was but a beginning.	炮舰外交迫使日本门户开放并且在十九世纪中叶签署不平等条约只是一个开始。
More immediately, the Great Depression and the subsequent compartmentalization of the world into economic blocs also worked to the advantage of the already powerful.	更为直接的是，经济大萧条以及随之而来各国经济组成集团同样有利于早先的列强。
Coupled with the economic hardship of the interwar years were instances of racial prejudice in the US that aimed at preventing Japanese immigration.	伴随两次世界大战之间经济困境的是美国种族偏见，意在防止日本移民。
United by this long-simmering and humiliating sense of exclusion, Japanese policymakers, whatever their differences, stumbled toward the December 1 decision to go to war.	日本决策者由于这一长期潜伏、令人羞辱的排斥之感而不顾彼此分歧，于12月1日决定开战。
With almost 70 years of hindsight, Pearl Harbor should offer some lessons for US foreign policy today.	珍珠港事件过去将近70年时间。 有了这一后见，这一事件应该给美国当今的外交政策提供某些经验教训。
Despite obvious differences between Pearl Harbor and recent Islamist terrorist tactics, they show the common desire of self-proclaimed Davids to topple their Goliaths in a clearly lop-sided battle.	尽管珍珠港事件和最近伊斯兰恐怖主义伎俩有明显的不同，但是它们都显现出在一场实力对比悬殊的战斗中鱼死网破的愿望。
These Davids depend on Western technologies to overcome imbalances of power, and are driven by a sense of real or imagined humiliation.	这些弱者依靠西方技术克服实力不平衡，而且他们都受到实际或者想像中受辱感的驱使。
But no matter how strong and historically justified such grievances may be those who resort to murderous tactics must be condemned.	但是，无论这些冤屈有多么强烈、具有多少历史合理性，那些采取谋杀伎俩的人都应该受到谴责。
However, high-handedness and tough talk alone are an inadequate response, for this approach further humiliates those who already feel humiliated, and alienates those who might otherwise proffer a more moderate voice.	但是，仅仅是态度强硬和严厉对话尚不足以回应，因为这一手段进一步羞辱那些已经感到受辱的人，并且让那些原本温和派离心离德。
Diplomacy no longer works with terrorism, but it can help to prevent it by dealing carefully with potentially hostile states.	对于恐怖主义外交已经无济于事，但是外交可以帮助认真应对潜在的敌对国家。
With global expectations mounting for a fresh start in US foreign policy, it is vital not just to remember, but to understand the attack on Pearl Harbor.	现在全世界日益期待美国���交改头换面，因此，不仅怀念、而且理解珍珠港事件也就越发重要。
	
Why Obamacare Survived	奥巴马医保为什么能活下来
CAMBRIDGE – Since the United States’ Affordable Care Act (ACA) – or “Obamacare” – was enacted in 2010, Republicans have been promising to “repeal and replace” it.	坎布里奇—自美国平价医疗法（ACA ） ， 即“奥巴马医保”于2010年实施以来，共和党一直承诺要“取消并取代”它。
When the 2016 presidential and congressional elections delivered all three branches of the US government to the party, the time to fulfill that promise seemed to have arrived.	2016年的总统和议会选举让美国政府的三大机关全都落入共和党之手，实现这一承诺的良机按理说已经到来。
Yet the anti-Obamacare crusade has just been dealt a crushing blow, owing to the refusal of some Republican senators to vote for the replacement legislation.	但反奥巴马医保运动却遭受重创，因为一些共和党参议员拒绝投票支持取代它的法案。
Republicans blame their failure on the Democrats’ refusal to cooperate.	共和党将它们的失败归咎于民主党拒绝配合。
But why should the Democrats help to dismantle their biggest legislative achievement of the last decade (if not longer)?	但民主党为什么要帮共和党取消他们在过去十年（乃至更长时间）里所获得的最大的立法成就？
The major flaws in Obamacare are not, as has been argued, unintended consequences of a poorly designed policy, which thus must be replaced; instead, they stem from Republican demands.	奥巴马医保的最大缺陷并不是有人所谓的政策设计漏洞所造成的意外后果（因此必须用别的政策取而代之 ） ； 相反，这些缺陷来自共和党的要求。
In any case, Republicans have majorities in both houses of Congress, so they don’t actually need the Democrats’ support to pass legislation.	说到底，共和党拥有国会两院的多数地位，因此他们其实不需要民主党的支持就可以通过法案。
Likewise, President Donald Trump’s unprecedented lack of experience and general incompetence cannot be at fault, as he isn’t indispensible to the repeal and replace process.	类似地，总统特朗普登峰造极的缺少经验和无能也不是借口，因为他并不是取消和取代过程的必要条件。
The truth is that the blame belongs squarely on the shoulders of congressional Republicans.	真相是这完全应该归咎于国会共和党。
Since 2010, they voted more than 50 times to repeal the ACA.	自2010年以来，他们进行了50多次投票要取消ACA。
Those votes may have been merely symbolic, given Obama’s veto power; nonetheless, the striking fact remains that the Republicans never bothered to try to formulate an alternative in the event that one of their own would one day become president.	这些投票有的只是象征性的（因为奥巴马拥有否决权 ） ； 但重要的事实仍然是，共和党一直在酝酿替代方案，等到共和党成为总统时就可以取ACA而代之。
In fact, they couldn’t formulate a workable alternative to Obamacare, because some within their ranks refuse to accept the basic laws of arithmetic.	事实上，他们不可能制定出有效的奥巴马医保替代方案，因为一些共和党人拒绝承认基本算术。
According to the estimates produced by the Congressional Budget Office, which has a very good track record, the Republicans’ proposed health-care legislation would have caused more than 20 million Americans to lose insurance coverage.	根据国会预算办公室的测算 — — 其具有相当好的历史记录 — — 共和党提出的医保立法将导致2,000多万美国人失去医疗保险。
But many Republicans continue to insist that they can somehow slash spending and eliminate rules and requirements, including the “individual mandate” (the requirement that all Americans have health insurance) that underpins Obamacare, without affecting current coverage levels.	但许多共和党人仍然坚持他们可以设法削减支出，取消规则和要求，包括奥巴马医保的基石 — — “个人强制保险 ” ， 而不会影响到当前的医保覆盖水平。
Of course, there are Republicans who acknowledge the facts.	当然，也有承认事实的共和党人。
Some support repeal and replace anyway: Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, for example, is a relatively consistent libertarian who believes that the benefits of minimizing the government’s role in health care somehow outweigh the costs to lower- and middle-income working Americans.	但仍有一些支持取消和取代：比如，肯塔基州参议员兰德·保罗（Rand Paul）相对来说是一个一贯的自由派，认为政府的医保角色最小化的好处要大于美国中低收入工作阶级所增加的成本。
Others recognize that the costs are unacceptable – indeed, that is why the Republican-proposed replacement has just been rejected – but have been unable to put forward any credible alternative.	也有人认为成本令人难以接受 — — 事实上，这正是共和党提出的取代政策惨遭拒绝的原因 — — 但又拿不出任何可信的替代方案。
Logically, there should be a third group of moderate Republicans who acknowledge the arithmetic, find it unacceptable, and commit either to reforming Obamacare or developing some other realistic plan that can deliver better health insurance to more Americans.	从逻辑上讲，应该有第三类温和派共和党，他们承认基本算术，发现了它根本难以接受，并决心改革奥巴马医保或制定其他能够给更多美国人带来更好的医疗保险的现实的计划。
Unfortunately, there is nobody left in this category, except perhaps Senator Susan Collins of Maine.	不幸的是，属于这个类别的一个人也没有，兴许缅因州参议员苏珊·柯林斯（Susan Collins）是个例外。
But there is another, deeper reason why the Republicans cannot come up with an alternative to Obamacare: the ACA is based firmly on their own ideas.	但对于为何共和党人拿不出奥巴马医保的替代方案，还有一个更深层次的原因：ACA完全符合他们自己的想法。
For example, the individual mandate that they now decry was originally developed by conservative think tanks seeking to devise a workable system of national health insurance with the smallest possible role for the government.	比如，他们现在所攻讦的个人强制保险，原本就是由保守派智库提出的，目的是要设计一个政府在其中的作用最小化的可行的全国医保体系。
It was the centerpiece of Massachusetts’ health-care reform signed by Mitt Romney in 2006, when he was the state’s governor.	这也是米特·罗姆尼（Mitt Romney）2006年担任马萨诸塞州州长时签署的该州医保改革的核心内容。
The individual mandate is essential to barring insurance companies from discriminating against those with pre-existing conditions – a provision that even Obamacare’s opponents want to keep.	个人强制保险是防止保险公司歧视疾患人士的必要条件 — — 这一点即使是奥巴马医保的反对者也是同意的。
It is not financially feasible for private insurance companies to insure people who are already sick or at high risk, if those who are still healthy are not also in the pool.	私营保险公司为已经患病或患病风险很高的人提供保险在财务上是不可行的，如果不把那些仍然健康的人也纳入其中的话。
This does not mean that the US needs to go to the extreme of a full-on socialized health-care system, whereby the government directly provides health care to all (though the British are certainly attached to their National Health Service).	这并不意味着美国需要走极端，采取全面社会化的医保体系，即政府直接为全民提供医疗（尽管英国人全都拥有国民医疗服务 ） 。
And, indeed, nobody in the US is calling for that.	而事实上，在美国也没有任何人要求这样做。
What some – most vocally, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders – have proposed is a single-payer system.	一些人 — — 首屈一指的要数佛蒙特州参议员伯尼·桑德斯（Bernie Sanders ） — —提出了一个偿付者（single-payer）体系。
In Canada, such a system of government insurance and private provision of services delivers strong health outcomes at a fraction of the cost of the US system.	在加拿大，这一政府保险和私人服务体系与美国的医疗体系相比，可谓事半功倍。
Yet, while a substantial share of Americans may support such a system, a single-payer program would face strong resistance from three powerful groups: the insurance industry, consumers who are happy with their current employer-paid plans, and Republicans in general.	然而，尽管会有很大一部分美国人支持单一偿付者体系，该体系将面临三大权势集团的抵制：保险业、对目前的雇主偿付体系很满意的消费者，以及大部分共和党。
But the system many Republicans tout – a scheme based fully on “personal responsibility” – is not feasible.	但许多共和党人所吹捧的体系 — — 一套完全基于“个人责任”的机制 — — 根本不可行。
The system the US had before Obamacare did not meet that standard, as the uninsured imposed costs not just on themselves, but also on other Americans.	在奥巴马医保前，美国实施的体系达不到这一标准，无保险覆盖者不但给自己造成了成本，也给其他美国人造成了成本。
Those without insurance are more likely to experience conditions like obesity and addiction, and to let their health deteriorate before seeking medical attention.	无保险覆盖者更有可能发生肥胖和毒瘾等情况，并且往往放任身体恶化而不去寻医问药。
Before Obamacare, hospitals would simply pass the higher costs of treating them on to other patients.	在奥巴马医保实施前，医院只需要将治疗他们的高昂成本转嫁给其他患者即可。
A system of genuine personal responsibility would require that the medical profession not provide care that it feels ethically obliged to provide.	一套真正的个人责任体系要求医疗界不提供在道义上有义务提供的医疗服务。
But I have yet to meet a free-market conservative who would truly favor a new federal law requiring ambulances to leave accident victims by the side of the road unless they can show proof of insurance.	但迄今为止我还没有遇到过一位自由市场保守派，真正支持实施新的联邦法律，要求救护车在事故受害者拿不出医保证明的情况下，将他仍在路旁。
The solution to America’s health-care woes lies somewhere between socialized medicine and laissez-faire.	美国就医难问题的解决方案必然要兼顾社会化医疗和自由放任。
But there is no question that it must include something like the three legs of the Obamacare “stool”: the individual mandate, protection for those with pre-existing conditions, and a means to pay for it all.	但毫无疑问，这必须包括奥巴马医保“板凳”的三条腿：个人强制保险、覆盖疾患人士，以及为全体公民偿付的方法。
Though some Republicans pretend otherwise, there is simply no solution that decreases the role of government without increasing the ranks of the uninsured – and thus raising total health-care costs.	尽管一些共和党人装作在寻找替代方案，但根本不存在既能限制政府的角色，又不会提高无保险覆盖者地位（ranks ） — —从而提高医保总成本 — — 的办法。
	
America’s Global Election	关乎全球的美国选举
NEW YORK – Most people around the world will not be able to vote in the United States’s upcoming presidential election, even though they have a great deal at stake in the result.	发自纽约 — — 世界上大部分人都无法在即将到来的美国总统大选上投票，尽管大选的结果与他们的利益息息相关。
Overwhelmingly, non-US citizens favor Barack Obama’s re-election over a victory for his challenger, Mitt Romney.	相比米特·罗姆尼（Mitt Romney ） — —美国以外的大多数人更希望巴拉克·奥巴马（Barack Obama）能连任。
There are good reasons for this.	他们有充分的理由支持奥巴马而非罗姆尼。
In terms of the economy, the effects of Romney’s policies in creating a more unequal and divided society would not be directly felt abroad.	就经济而言，美国之外的人们并不会直接感受到罗姆尼创造一个更不平等更分裂的社会政策所带来的影响。
But, in the past, for better and for worse, others have often followed America’s example.	然而一直以来，无论美国的做法是好是坏，其他国家通常都会争相效仿。
Many governments quickly subscribed to Ronald Reagan’s mantra of deregulated markets – policies that eventually brought about the worst global recession since the 1930’s.	之前许多政府曾迅速追随美国前总统罗纳德·里根（Ronald Reagan）放松管制市场的口号 — — 这种政策最终酿成了自1930年代以来最严重的全球经济衰退。
Other countries that followed America’s lead have experienced growing inequality – more money at the top, more poverty at the bottom, and a weaker middle class.	其它以美国为榜样的国家都经历了日渐恶化的不平等状态 — — 富人越来越富有，穷人越来越穷困，而中产阶级的力量则日渐薄弱。
Romney’s proposed contractionary policies – the attempt to reduce deficits prematurely, while the US economy is still frail – will almost surely weaken America’s already anemic growth, and, if the euro crisis worsens, it could bring on another recession.	罗姆尼推荐主张经济紧缩的政策 — — 当美国经济仍然很虚弱时贸然试图降低赤字 — — 几乎必然会削弱美国本已乏力的增长，而且，如果欧元危机继续恶化，将会引发另一轮衰退。
At that point, with US demand shrinking, the rest of the world would indeed feel the economic effects of a Romney presidency quite directly.	到那时，随着美国需求萎缩，世界其他国家将真切而直接地感受到罗姆尼任总统所带来的经济效应。
That raises the question of globalization, which entails concerted action on many fronts by the international community.	这就引出了全球化的问题，全球化在许多方面都需要国际社会一致行动。
But what is required with regard to trade, finance, climate change, and a host other areas is not being done.	但在贸易、金融、气候变化以及许多其他领域上需要做的事情都没有实现。
Many people attribute these failures partly to an absence of American leadership.	很多人把这些失败在某种程度上归咎于缺乏美国的领导。
But, while Romney may summon bravado and strong rhetoric, other world leaders would be unlikely to follow him, owing to the belief (correct in my judgment) that he would take the US – and them – in the wrong direction.	然而，尽管罗姆尼或许会发表强硬的言论甚至虚张声势，世界上其他领导人也不大可能会追随他，因为他们认为（依我判断这是正确的）罗姆尼将会把美国以及他们带往一个错误的方向。
American “exceptionalism” may sell well at home, but it does poorly abroad.	美国“例外论”在其国内也许很得人心，但国外却不这么看。
President George W. Bush’s Iraq war – arguably a violation of international law – showed that though America spends almost as much on defense as the rest of the world combined, it could not pacify a country with less than 10% of its population and less than 1% of its GDP.	前美国总统乔治·沃克·布什（George W. Bush）所发动的伊拉克战争 — — 可以说这违反了国际法 — — 显示了尽管美国国防支出几乎等于世界其他国家的总和，它也无法使一���人口只有其10 % ， GDP仅相当于其1%的国家屈服。
Moreover, it turned out that US-style capitalism was neither efficient nor stable.	此外，事实证明美国式资本主义既没有效率也不稳定。
With most Americans’ incomes stagnating for a decade and a half, it was clear that the US economic model was not delivering for most citizens, whatever official GDP data said.	从大部分美国人的收入停滞了十五年的情况看来，不管官方的GDP数据怎么说，显然美国的经济模式并不能给大部分公民带来益处。
Indeed, the model blew up even before Bush left office.	确实，这种模式的弊端甚至在小布什离任之前就显露出来了。
Together with the abuses of human rights under his administration, the Great Recession – the predictable (and predicted) consequence of his economic policies – did as much to weaken America’s soft power as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan did to weaken the credibility of its military power.	加上小布什政府对人权的滥用，经济大萧条 — — 这是布什经济政策可预见（确实被预测中了）的后果 — — 确实像伊拉克战争和阿富汗战争削弱了美国军事实力的可信度一样削弱了美国的软实力。
In terms of values – namely, the values of Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan – things are not much better.	在价值观方面 — — 也就是罗姆尼和他的竞选伙伴保罗·瑞安（Paul Ryan）的价值观 — — 情况也不甚理想。
For example, every other advanced country recognizes the right to accessible health care, and Obama’s Affordable Care Act represents a significant step toward that goal.	比如，所有其他的发达国家都承认其公民有获得价格合理医疗服务的权力，而奥巴马的可承担医疗法案（Affordable Care Act）则代表了朝该目标迈进的重要一步。
But Romney has criticized this effort, and has offered nothing in its place.	罗姆尼对此大加批判，但却未能提出任何可以替代这一法案的政策。
America now has the distinction of being among the advanced countries that afford the least equality of opportunity to their citizens.	美国现在是给本国公民提供机会最不均等的发达国家之一。
And Romney’s drastic budget cutbacks, targeted at the poor and middle class, would further impede social mobility.	而罗姆尼针对穷人和中产阶级的大幅预算削减政策会进一步阻碍社会流动性。
At the same time, he would expand the military, spending more money on weapons that do not work against enemies that do not exist, enriching defense contractors like Halliburton at the expense of desperately needed public investment in infrastructure and education.	同时他还会扩大军队，花更多的钱在武器上 — — 这些武器并不会对不存在的敌人起到任何作用，只能使哈利伯顿（Halliburton）这类国防军工企业更加富有，而这是以牺牲急需政府投资的基础设施和教育为代价的。
While Bush is not on the ballot, Romney has not really distanced himself from the Bush administration’s policies.	虽然小布什没有参加竞选，罗姆尼却没有和小布什政府过去的政策划清界限。
On the contrary, his campaign has featured the same advisers, the same devotion to higher military spending, the same belief that tax cuts for the rich are the solution to every economic problem, and the same fuzzy budget math.	相反，他的竞选活动使用同样的顾问团，同样致力于更高的军事支出，也怀着同样的信念 — — 即给富人减税是解决所有经济问题的办法，还有同样含糊不清的预算计算方法。
Consider, for example, the three issues that are at the center of the global agenda mentioned earlier: climate change, financial regulation, and trade.	细想一下，比如之前提到的全球议程最关注的三个议题：气候变化、金融监管和贸易。
Romney has been silent on the first, and many in his party are “climate deniers.”	罗姆尼对第一个问题一直保持沉默，而他所在的共和党人很多人都“否认气候问题的存在 ” 。
The world cannot expect genuine leadership from Romney there.	在这个问题上，全世界都不用指望罗姆尼了。
As for financial regulation, while the recent crisis has highlighted the need for stricter rules, agreement on many issues has proven to be elusive, partly because the Obama administration is too close to the financial sector.	至于金融监管，最近的危机凸显出人们需要制定更为严格的监管规则，然而在许多问题上所达成的协议被证明是逃避问题的，这一部分是由于奥巴马政府与财政部门过于亲近。
With Romney, though, there would be no distance at all: metaphorically speaking, he is the financial sector.	但对罗姆尼来说根本不存在距离的问题：形象地说，他本人就是财政部门。
One financial issue on which there is global agreement is the need to close down offshore bank havens, which exist mainly for purposes of tax evasion and avoidance, money laundering, and corruption.	一个全球已达成协议的金融问题就是需要关闭离岸银行这个避风港 — — 离岸银行的存在主要是为了避税漏税、洗钱和贪污。
Money does not go to the Cayman Islands because sunshine makes it grow faster; this money thrives on the absence of sunshine.	钱流入开曼群岛并不是因为那里的阳光让这些钱增长得更快，这些钱本来就是在黑暗中积累出来的。
But, with Romney unapologetic about his own use of Cayman banks, we are unlikely to see progress even in this area.	然而，罗姆尼自己就使用开曼银行，而且对此毫无悔意，我们也不大可能会看到他会在这方面有所作为。
On trade, Romney promises to launch a trade war with China, and to declare it a currency manipulator on Day One – a promise that gives him little wiggle room.	在贸易方面，罗姆尼许诺要跟中国打一场贸易战，并在上任第一天就宣布其为汇率操纵国 — — 这把他逼到了墙角。
He refuses to note the renminbi’s large real appreciation in recent years, or to acknowledge that, while changes in China’s exchange rate may affect the bilateral trade deficit, what matters is America’s multilateral trade deficit.	他拒绝关注这几年来人民币汇率的大幅度实际升值，或者说拒绝承认虽然中国的汇率变化可能会影响双边贸易逆差，但更重要的其实是美国的多边贸易逆差。
A stronger renminbi would simply mean a switch in the US from China to lower-cost producers of textiles, apparel, and other goods.	人民币走强直接意味着纺织品，服装和其他商品的低成本制造国从中国变成了美国。
The irony – again lost on Romney – is that other countries are accusing the US of currency manipulation.	讽刺的是 — — 这依然无法引起罗姆尼的注意 — — 其他国家正谴责在美国操纵汇率。
After all, one of the main benefits of the Federal Reserve’s policy of “quantitative easing” – perhaps the only channel with a significant effect on the real economy – derives from the depreciation of the US dollar.	毕竟，美联储的量化宽松政策的其中一个主要好处 — — 也许是唯一一个能对实体经济产生重大影响的渠道 — — 就来自于美元的贬值。
The world has a lot riding on America’s election.	美国的总统大选对整个世界来说影响都很大。
Unfortunately, most people who will be affected by it – almost the entire world – will have no influence on the outcome.	不幸地是，大部分即将受到该选举影响的人 — — 几乎是整个世界 — — 对结果却没有任何的影响力。
	
The Battle Cry of the Non-Oppressed	未受压迫者的战争号角
TEL AVIV – Nobody should be surprised that Scotland’s recent referendum on independence left the United Kingdom intact.	特拉维夫—苏格兰最近的独立公投的最终结果是英国安然无恙，这本不令人奇怪。
In the past, regions or communities have achieved statehood almost exclusively after a struggle against colonial subjection and oppression, galvanized by an appeal to a distinctive religious, cultural, or ethnic identity.	在过去，地区或社会建国成功几乎清一色是依靠反殖民统治和压迫的斗争，推动力量往往是独特的宗教、文化或种族身份诉求。
Complaints about economic dynamics, social policies, or governance inefficiencies – the basis of Scotland’s “yes” campaign – are not the cris de coeur of a successful independence movement.	关于经济活力、社会政策或治理低效的怨气 — — 苏格兰对独立说“是”的阵营的基础就在于此 — — 从未唤起过成功的独立运动。
That is bad news for secessionists elsewhere in the West.	对西方的其他分裂主义者来说，这是个坏消息。
Of course, Scotland’s technocratic nationalism made sense.	当然，苏格兰的技术官僚民族主义有其意义。
As the movement’s leader, Alex Salmond, acknowledged in a 2012 consultation document, “Scotland is not oppressed and we have no need to be liberated.”	独立运动领导人亚历克斯·萨尔蒙德（Alex Salmond）在2012 的咨文中承认 ， “ 苏格兰没有受到压迫，我们不需要被解放 。 ”
The struggle for independence, he explained, was aimed at creating the kind of efficient administrative and economic structures that would enable Scotland to reach its potential.	他解释说，独立斗争的目标是建立高效的行政和经济结构，以使苏格兰实现潜力。
The “yes” campaign hoped to win supporters with a utopian vision of an independent Scotland that included European Union and NATO membership; a currency union with England, but no fiscal union; improved public services and social benefits; and lower taxes.	“是”阵营希望凭借一个拥有欧盟和北约成员资格的独立的苏格兰、一个和英格兰一起构成的货币而非财政的联盟、改善的公共服务和社会福利以及更低的税收这一乌托邦前景赢得支持者。
In other words, Scotland would have everything it has now, only better, and on its own terms.	换句话说，独立后的苏格兰将拥有现在所拥有的一切，只会更好，不会更差。
This vision was undoubtedly appealing to many Scots.	这一前景毫无疑问吸引了大量苏格兰人。
But it proved significantly less compelling than the economic doomsday scenarios advanced by its unionist opponents, including former US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, former World Bank President Robert Zoellick, and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne.	但显然它远远敌不过包括前美联储主席艾伦·格林斯潘、前世界银行行长罗伯特·佐利克和前财政大臣乔治·奥斯本在内的统一主义反对派所宣扬的经济末日情景。
In other words, many people’s votes were driven by risk aversion, fear, and intimidation, rather than hope, passion, or deep emotional attachment to a common identity.	换句话说，许多人的投票受风险厌恶、恐惧和威胁的驱动，而不是受希望、激情或对共同身份的深刻情感归属的驱动。
This contrasts sharply with the motivations espoused by Scotland’s nobles in the fourteenth century, when they succeeded in preserving their country’s independence from English rule.	这与十四世纪苏格兰贵族所发动的运动截然相反。 当时，他们成功地捍卫了国家脱离英格兰统治的独立性。
“It is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honors that we are fighting,” they declared, “but for freedom alone, which no honest man gives up but with life itself.”	“事实上，我们的斗争不是为了光荣、富有或荣耀 ， ” 他们说 ， “ 而只是为了自由，没有哪个诚实的人会放弃自由 。 ”
In fact, the “no” campaign’s victory might have been even more resounding if the Westminster establishment’s desperate, last-minute offer to grant Scotland more powers on taxation, spending, and welfare had been included as an option in the ballot.	事实上，如果英国当局最后时刻授予苏格兰更大的征税、支出和福利权力的争取姿态一开始就包括在投票选项中的话 ， “ 不”阵营的胜利还会更加辉煌。
National movements driven by a historical mission or an uncompromising quest to assert group identity against a dominant power normally do not succumb to economic considerations and last-minute economic bait.	受历史使命或面对主宰势力主张群体身份的不可妥协的要求驱动的国家运动通常不会屈从于经济考虑或最后时刻的经济诱惑。
It was none other than the founder of the Zionist fundamentalist right, Ze’ev Jabotinsky, who warned in 1924 against “the naive assumption that the aspiration of the Palestinians…will be paralyzed by such means as subsidies, economic advantages, or bribery.”	原教旨锡安主义右派创始人杰伊夫·亚博金斯基（Ze’ev Jabotinsky）在1924年警告说 ， “ 巴勒斯坦人的雄心 … … 可以通过补贴、经济进步或自由这样的办法消磨，这样的想法是幼稚的 。 ”
Recognizing that their “natural patriotism is pure and noble,” he knew that they could not be “bought off.”	他意识到巴勒斯坦人“纯粹而高贵的天生的爱国主义 ” ， 明白他们不可能被“收买 ” 。
Now, Salmond is probably re-thinking his avoidance of nativist identity politics.	如今，萨尔蒙德或许在反思他回避本土身份政治的做法。
What Edmund Burke defined as a group’s attachment to “the inns and resting places of the human spirit” – that is, ethnic, religious, and community ties – would have been a much more powerful mobilizing force for an independence movement.	埃德蒙·伯克（Edmund Burke）所定义的一个群体对“人类精神的栖身之所 ” — —即种族、宗教和社会联系 — — 的依恋将永远是更有力得多的独立运动动员力。
The “yes” campaigners would not have had to look far for inspiration.	“是”阵营本不需要辛苦寻找灵感。
James Joyce – himself not devoid of traces of Irish nationalism – wrote that “nationality, language, [and] religion” are “the nets” into which “a man is born.”	詹姆斯·乔伊斯（James Joyce ） — —他本人并未摆脱爱尔兰民族主义痕迹 — — 写道 ， “ 国籍、语言 、 [ 和]宗教”是“人类诞生”于其中的“网 ” 。
Similarly, George Orwell distinguished between Celtic nationalism and Anglophobia, stating that the former is belief “in the past and future greatness of the Celtic peoples.”	类似地，乔治·奥威尔（George Orwell）区分凯尔特民族主义者和仇英心理，指出前者是对“凯尔特民族过去和未来的伟大”的信念。
True, Scotland’s great minds in the age of Enlightenment, such as David Hume, Adam Smith, and even the national poet, Robert Burns, were all fervent advocates of “Britishness,” whatever that might mean today.	诚然，启蒙时代苏格兰的伟大思想家 — — 如大卫·休谟、亚当·斯密乃至于国民诗人罗伯特·彭斯（Robert Burns ） — —无不是“英国性”的强烈支持者，不管今天这可能意味着什么。
Yet an identity-based campaign could have resorted to the heritage of the Scottish Renaissance of the mid-twentieth century or to the Celtic Revival and Celtic Twilight movements, which awakened a spirit of cultural nationalism among Scots in the late nineteenth century.	但基于身份的运动本可以诉诸于二十世纪中叶的苏格兰复兴（Scottish Renaissance）或在19世纪末唤醒了苏格兰人文化民族主义精神的凯尔特复兴和凯尔特曙光（Celtic Revival and Celtic Twilight）等运动。
In the run-up to the referendum, Scotland’s independence movement became an important point of reference for Catalans and Basques in Spain, the Flemish in Belgium, the Veneto and South Tyrol regions in Italy, Corsicans and Bretons in France, and the secessionists of Quebec.	在通往公投的过程中，苏格兰独立运动成为西班牙加泰罗尼亚人和巴斯克人、比利时弗朗芒人、意大利威尼托（Veneto）和南蒂罗尔（South Tyrol）地区、法国科西嘉人和布列塔尼人以及魁北克分裂分子的重要参照点。
All hoped that Scotland would pave the way for the peaceful breakup of their own states.	他们无不希望苏格兰能为他们自身的建国开辟一条和平分裂之路。
With the defeat of Scotland’s independence movement – not to mention Québécois voters’ stunning rejection of the province’s largest separatist party in last April’s election – that hope may be waning.	苏格兰独立运动失败了 — — 更不用说去年4月魁北克省选举中选民一边倒地拒绝了最大的分裂主义政党 — — 这一希望也随之落空。
And with good reason.	理应如此。
There is little historical precedent for the peaceful breakup of a state, with an exception like Czechoslovakia’s consensual split in 1993 occurring in unique circumstances.	国家和平分裂的先例极少，捷克斯洛伐克1993年的自愿分裂只是例外，需要相当独特的环境才能发生。
A state is far more likely to go to war to defend its unity.	更有可能的是国家发动战争捍卫统一。
The United States and Spain did it in their civil wars, and today’s Spain would go to the outer limits of its capacity to prevent a Catalan or Basque referendum, let alone independence.	美国和西班牙的内战都是如此，今天的西班牙也会竭尽全力阻止加泰罗尼亚或巴斯克公投，更不用说独立了。
Nationalist groups in Western democracies are not subjugated people.	西方民主国家的民族主义群体并非被征服者。
Theirs is the nationalism of free, liberated people, who can expect the most generous devolution deals possible to protect their singular legacies and address their grievances.	他们是自由的民族主义、被解放的人民，大可期待获得最慷慨的放权保护他们独特的遗产、消弭他们的仇恨。
And perhaps that is why federal arrangements like those in Australia and Canada – essentially what Westminster grudgingly offered Scotland – could be their best option.	也许正因如此，澳大利亚和加拿大等国家的联邦制度可以成为他们的最佳选择 — — 英国不情愿地向苏格兰所做的让步亦然。
	
Long Live China’s Slowdown	中国经济放缓万岁
NEW HAVEN – At 7.7%, China’s annual GDP growth in the first quarter of this year was slower than many expected.	发自纽黑文 — — 今年第一季度中国7.7%的年GDP增长率比很多人预计的要缓慢得多。
While the data were hardly devastating relative to a consensus forecast of 8.2%, many (including me) expected a second consecutive quarterly rebound from the slowdown that appeared to have ended in the third quarter of 2012.	虽然这一数据相对普遍8.2%的预测来说并不是灾难性的，但很多人（包括我）都预计这次放缓 — — 这种放缓似乎在2012年第三季度就已经结束了 — — 后出现连续性的二次反弹。
China doubters around the world were quick to pounce on the number, expressing fears of a stall, or even a dreaded double dip.	而世界各地的中国怀疑论者则迅速针对这一数据大做文章，担心经济停滞甚至出现可怕的二次衰退。
But slower GDP growth is actually good for China, provided that it reflects the long-awaited structural transformation of the world’s most dynamic economy.	但假如能反映出全世界最活跃的经济体已经出现期待已久的结构性改革的话，较为缓慢的GDP增长对中国来说就是件好事。
The broad outlines of this transformation are well known – a shift from export- and investment-led growth to an economic structure that draws greater support from domestic private consumption.	这个改革的大轮廓是众所周知的 — — 即从出口及投资导向型经济增长向由更多国内个人消费支撑的经济结构过渡。
Less well known is that a rebalanced China should have a slower growth rate – the first hints of which may now be evident.	更不为人所知的是重新平衡后的中国增长率应该更低 — — 其第一批暗示迹象如今已经成为了现实。
A rebalanced China can grow more slowly for one simple reason: By drawing increased support from services-led consumer demand, China’s new model will embrace a more labor-intensive growth recipe.	重新调整过的中国会因为一个简单的原因而增长得更慢：即通过不断拉动服务主导的消费者需求，中国的新模式将会迎来一个更加劳动密集型的增长模式。
The numbers seem to bear that out.	这些数据似乎证实了这一点。
China’s services sector requires about 35% more jobs per unit of GDP than do manufacturing and construction – the primary drivers of the old model.	中国的服务业每创造一个单位的GDP要比制造业和建筑业 — — 这是旧模式中最主要的驱动力 — — 所需的劳动要多35 % 。
That number has potentially huge implications, because it means that China could grow at an annual rate in the 7-8% range and still achieve its objectives with respect to employment and poverty reduction.	这个数据有着潜在的巨大影响，它意味着中国能以7-8%的年增长率增长，同时还能实现提升就业和降低贫困率的目标。
China has struggled to attain these goals with anything less than 10% growth, because the old model was not generating enough jobs per unit of output.	中国一直奋力在10%的增长率之上实现这些目标，因为旧模式每个单位的产出并不能产生足够的工作岗位。
As Chinese manufacturing moved up the value chain, firms increasingly replaced workers with machines embodying the latest technologies.	由于中国制造业不断向价值链的上端移动，公司也不断地用最先进的机器来取代工人。
As a result, its economic model spawned a labor-saving, capital-intensive growth dynamic.	因此其经济模式催生了一个节省劳力，资本密集型的增长模式。
On one level, that made sense.	从某个程度说，这是说得通的。
Capital-labor substitution is at the heart of modern productivity strategies for manufacturing-based economies.	对以制造业为主的经济体来说，资本替代劳力是现代生产力的核心策略。
But it left China in a deepening hole: increasingly deficient in jobs per unit of output, it needed more units of output to absorb its surplus labor.	但这让中国陷入了难以自拔的泥潭：每单位产出所提供的工作岗位越来越少，这就需要更多的产出来吸收多余的劳力。
Ultimately, that became more of a problem than a solution.	最终，这会成为一个问题而不是解决方案。
The old manufacturing model, which fueled an unprecedented 20-fold increase in per capita income relative to the early 1990’s, also sowed the seeds of excessive resource consumption and environmental degradation.	旧的生产模式在上世纪90年代初期推动了前所未有的人均收入20倍的增长，同时也埋下了过度消耗资源和环境退化的隐患。
Services-led growth is, in many ways, the antidote to the “unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated, and ultimately unsustainable” growth model that former Premier Wen Jiabao’s famously criticized in 2007.	服务导向型增长从很多方面来说都能解决“不稳定、不平衡、不协调并最终不可持续”的增长模式 — — 众所周知前总理温家宝批评过这一模式。
Yet services offer more than just a labor-intensive growth path.	然而服务业提供的不仅是劳动密集的增长路径。
Compared to manufacturing, they have much smaller resource and carbon footprints.	相对制造业，它们使用的能源更少，碳排放量也低。
A services-led model provides China with an alternative, environmentally friendlier, and ultimately more sustainable economic structure.	服务导向的模式给中国提供了一种选择，对环境更有益，最终而言也是一种更可持续的经济结构。
It is premature, of course, to conclude that a services-led transformation to slower growth is now at hand.	当然，由此就断言很快服务业就会导致增长更缓慢还为时过早。
The latest data hint at such a possibility, with the tertiary sector (services) expanding at an 8.3% annual rate in the first quarter of this year – the third consecutive quarter of acceleration and a half-percentage point faster than the 7.8% first-quarter gain recorded by the secondary sector (manufacturing and construction).	最新的数据暗示了这种可能性，第三产业（即服务业）在今年第一季度以8.3%的速度扩张 — — 这是其连续第三个季度的加速并比第二产业第一季度（制造业和建筑业）7.8%的增长率高出半个百分点。
But it will take more than a few quarters of mildly encouraging data to validate such an important shift in the Chinese economy’s underlying structure.	但是要证明中国经济发生了根本结构的改变还需要多几个季度的数据来支撑。
Not surprisingly, China skeptics are putting a different spin on the latest growth numbers.	然而不出所料，中国怀疑论者也对最新的增长数据赋予了完全不同的意义。
Fears of a shadow-bank-induced credit bubble now top the worry list, reinforcing longstanding concerns that China may succumb to the dreaded “middle-income trap” – a sustained growth slowdown that has ensnared most high-growth emerging economies at the juncture that China has now reached.	他们现在最担忧影子银行会引发信贷泡沫，这又让强化了他们一直以来的担忧：中国可能会掉入可怕的“中等收入陷阱 ” — —这是一种很多高增长新兴经济体在发展到中国这个阶段都面对过的持续增长放缓。
China is hardly immune to such a possibility.	中国几乎不大可能避免这种可能性。
But it is unlikely to occur if China can carry out the services-led pro-consumption rebalancing that remains the core strategic initiative of its current (12th) Five-Year Plan.	但���果中国能进行服务主导消费导向的调整 — — 这仍然是中国当前（第十二个）五年计划的核心战略，这种情况就不大可能会发生。
Invariably, the middle-income trap afflicts those emerging economies that cling to early-stage development models for too long.	不变地是，中等收入陷阱会折磨那些过分长期依赖初级阶段发展模式的新兴经济体。
For China, the risk will be highest if it sticks with the timeworn recipe of unbalanced manufacturing- and construction-led growth, which has created such serious sustainability problems.	对中国来说，如果它继续其过时且不平衡的制造业和建筑业主导增长模式 — — 这已经导致了非常严重的可持续性问题，那么它就很有可能掉进这一陷阱。
If China fails to rebalance, weak external demand from a crisis-battered developed world will continue to hobble its export machine, forcing it to up the ante on a credit- and investment-led growth model – in effect, doubling down on resource-intensive and environmentally damaging growth.	如果中国无法成功调整，发达国家饱受危机冲击的疲软外部需求将会持续遏制其出口机器，迫使它在信贷和投资主导的增长模式上押更多的赌注 — — 实际上就会加倍进行资源密集和伤害环境的增长。
But I remain hopeful that China’s new leadership team will move quickly to implement its new model.	但我依旧对中国新的领导班子很快实施新模式保持乐观。
There are no viable alternatives.	因为他们并没有什么切实可行的替代方案。
Financial markets, as well as growth-starved developed economies, are not thrilled with the natural rhythm of slower growth that a rebalanced Chinese economy is likely to experience.	金融市场，以及缺乏增长的发达国家，并不喜欢调整后的中国经济可能要经历的增长放缓。
Resource industries – indeed, resource-based economies like Australia, Canada, Brazil, and Russia – have become addicted to China’s old strain of unsustainable hyper-growth.	资源产业 — — 事实上像澳大利亚、加拿大、巴西和俄罗斯这些资源型经济体 — — 都已经过度依赖中国过去那种不可持续的高速增长张力。
Yet China knows that it is time to break that dangerous habit.	然而中国自知是时候要破除这一危险习惯了。
The United States is likely to have a different problem with consumer-led growth in China.	很有可能中国的消费者主导增长模式对美国来说会成为一个问题。
After all, higher private consumption implies an end to China’s surplus saving – and thus to the seemingly open-ended recycling of that surplus into dollar-based assets such as US Treasury bills.	毕竟更高的私人消费意味着中国的储蓄盈余时代走向终结 — — 从而也不能再无限循环利用这种盈余转化为美元资产，比如美国国库券。
Who will then fund America’s budget deficit – and on what terms?	那么谁又能为美国的预算赤字提供资金 — — 其条件又会是什么呢？
Just as China must embrace slower growth as a natural consequence of its rebalancing imperative, the rest of the world will need to figure out how to cope when it does.	正如中国必须接受较慢的增长作为其势在必行调整的结果，世界其他各国也需要找到应对这一状况的手段。
	
Why Small Booms Cause Big Busts	为何小泡沫会造成大萧条
BERKELEY – As bubbles go, it was not a very big one.	发自伯克利 — — 当泡沫膨胀时，其规模还不算太大。
From 2002 to 2006, the share of the American economy devoted to residential construction rose by 1.2 percentage points of GDP above its previous trend value, before plunging as the United States entered the greatest economic crisis in nearly a century.	在随美国遭遇近一个世纪以来最严重经济危机而暴跌之前的2002~2006年间，经济中住宅建筑占GDP的份额仅比先前的趋势值高出了1.2 % 。
According to my rough calculations, the excess investment in the housing sector during this period totaled some $500 billion – by any measure a tiny fraction of the world economy at the time of the crash.	据笔者的粗略计算，这一时期住房领域的过度投资总额约为5000亿美元 — — 无论怎样计算，都不过崩溃时世界经济总规模的一小部分而已。
The resulting damage, however, has been enormous.	然而因此造成的损失却是巨大的。
The economies of Europe and North America are roughly 6% smaller than we would have expected them to be had there been no crisis.	欧洲及北美各经济体比预期无危机的情况萎缩了6 % 。
In other words, a relatively small amount of overinvestment is responsible for some $1.8 trillion in lost production every year.	换句话说，相对少量的过度投资竟然导致了每年约1.8万亿美元的GDP损失。
Given that the gap shows no signs of closing, and accounting for expected growth rates and equity returns, I estimate that the total loss to production will eventually reach nearly $3 quadrillion.	鉴于跌幅尚未出现收窄的迹象，我估计包括预期增长率和股本回报率在内，GDP总损失最终将达到近3000万亿美元。
For each dollar of overinvestment in the housing market, the world economy will have suffered $6,000 in losses.	意味着每1美元的房地产市场过度投资会令世界经济遭受6000美元的损失。
How can this be?	这是怎么回事？
It is important to note that not all recessions cause so much pain.	需要特别注意的是，并非所有的经济衰退都会造成如此严重的痛苦。
Financial blows in 1987, 1991, 1997, 1998, and 2001 (when some $4 trillion of excess investment was lost when the dot-com bubble burst) had little impact on the broader real economy.	比如1987，1991，1997，1998和2001年（当时网络泡沫破灭，4万亿美元的过度投资也打了水漂）的金融冲击就对更广泛的实体经济影响不大。
The reason why things were different this time can be found in a recently published paper by Òscar Jordà, Moritz Schularick, and Alan M. Taylor.	而为什么这次情况会不同则可在奥斯卡·乔达（Òscar Jordà ） 、 莫利兹·舒拉里克（Moritz Schularick ） 、 艾伦M·泰勒（Alan M. Taylor）最近发表的论文里找到答案。
Large credit booms, the authors show, can greatly worsen the damage caused by the collapse of an asset bubble.	在这篇论文中作者指出，大规模的信贷繁荣会大大加重资产泡沫崩溃造成的破坏。
Historically, when a recession is caused by the collapse of an asset bubble that was not fueled by a credit boom, the economy is roughly 1-1.5% below what it otherwise would have been five years after the start of the downturn.	从历史上看，当经济衰退因并非由信贷繁荣推动的资产泡沫所引发时，在衰退开始的五年后经济要比无衰退情况下缩减1~1.5 % 。
When a credit boom is involved, however, the damage is significantly greater.	一旦由信贷繁荣所推动则破坏会明显扩大。
When the bubble is in equity prices, the economy performs 4% below par, on average, after five years – and as much as 9% below par when the bubble is in the housing market.	当泡沫体现在股价上时，衰退五年后经济的表现平均低于标准值4 % 。 当泡沫体现在房产市场时，这个数值将会达到9 % 。
Given these findings, it is clear that the distress experienced since the beginning of the economic crisis is not far out of line with historical experience.	有见及此，很显然自经济危机开始以来的惨痛经历也与历史经验不相上下。
For many economists, recessions are an inevitable part of the business cycle – the bust that necessarily follows, like a hangover, from any boom. John Maynard Keynes, however, had little time for this view.	在许多经济学家看来，衰退是经济周期不可避免的一部分 — — 无论任何繁荣，随后的爆破是必然的，就像痛饮之后的宿醉。
“It seems an extraordinary imbecility that this wonderful outburst of productive energy should be the prelude to impoverishment and depression,” Keynes wrote in 1931, after the boom years of the 1920s had given way to the Great Depression.	然而约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes）并不认同这一观点 ， “ 将生产能力的巨大膨胀视为贫困和衰退的必然前奏是非常愚蠢的 ， ” 凯恩斯在1920年代经济繁荣转向大萧条后的1931年写到。
“I find the explanation of the current business losses, of the reduction in output, and of the unemployment which necessarily ensues on this not in the high level of investment which was proceeding up to the spring of 1929, but in the subsequent cessation of this investment.”	“我发现当前商业亏损，产量减少及高失业率并非源自于一直延续到1929年春天的高投资水平，而是因为随后出现的投资中断 。 ”
A few years later, Keynes proposed a fix to the problem.	几年后，凯恩斯提出了问题的解决方法。
In The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, Keynes explained how booms are created when “investments which will in fact yield, say, 2% in conditions of full employment are made in the expectation of a yield of, say, 6% and are valued accordingly.”	在《就业、利息和货币的一般理论》一书中，凯恩斯解释了繁荣是如何建立的 ， “ 在充分就业情况下实际只能有，比如说，2%的投资收益率，但却被赋予了6%的预期收益率，并以此来进行估值 。 ”
In a recession, the problem is flipped. Investments that would yield 2% are “expected to yield less than nothing.”	在经济衰退期则相反，那些收益2%的投资却被视为“预期收益率小于零 。 ”
The result is a self-fulfilling prophecy, in which widespread unemployment does indeed drive the returns of those investments below zero.	所产生的结果就是一个自我实现的预言，大规模的失业事实上导致那些投资的回报率低于零。
“We reach a condition where there is a shortage of houses,” Keynes wrote, “but where nevertheless no one can afford to live in the houses that there are.”	“我们随后出现了住宅短缺的情况 ， ” 凯恩斯写到 ， “ 但即便如此就算有这些住宅也没人能承担得起”
His solution was simple: “The right remedy for the trade cycle is not to be found in abolishing booms and thus keeping us permanently in a semi-slump; but in abolishing slumps and thus keeping us permanently in a quasi-boom.”	他的解决方案也很简单 ： “ 纠正贸易周期的正确方法并不是消灭繁荣而使我们长期处于半衰退状态；而是消灭衰退而令我们长期处于准繁荣状态 。 ”
For Keynes, the underlying problem was a failure of the economy’s credit channels.	对于凯恩斯来说，最基本的问题在于经济体的信贷渠道出现失��。
The financial reaction to the collapse of a bubble and the resulting wave of bankruptcies drives the natural rate of interest below zero, even though there are still many ways to put people productively to work.	即便还有很多方法可以令人们积极开展工作，但对泡沫爆破以及随后银行倒闭潮的金融应对手段导致自然利率低于零。
Today, we recognize that clogged credit channels can cause an economic downturn.	如今，我们认识到信贷渠道受阻可以导致经济下行。
There are three commonly proposed responses.	对此也有三个经常提出的应对方案。
The first is expansionary fiscal policies, with governments taking up the slack in the face of weak private investment.	一是扩张性的财政政策，在私人投资不振的情况下政府把相关责任承担起来。
The second is a higher inflation target, giving central banks more room to respond to financial shocks.	二是提高通胀目标，给与中央银行更多的空间去应对金融冲击。
And the third is tight restrictions on debt and leverage, especially in the housing market, in order to prevent a credit-fueled price bubble from forming.	三是对负债和杠杆严加管控，尤其是住宅市场，防止形成由信贷推动的价格泡沫。
To these solutions, Keynes would have added a fourth, one known to us today as the “Greenspan put” – using monetary policy to validate the asset prices reached at the height of the bubble.	在这三个之外，凯恩斯会加上第四条，我们如今称之为“格林斯潘对策 ” — —利用货币政策去将泡沫最高峰时的资产价格合理化。
Unfortunately, in a world in which fiscal austerity appears to exert a mesmerizing hold over politicians, and in which a 2% inflation target seems set in stone, our policy options are rather limited.	不幸的是，在政客们似乎无法抗拒使用财政紧缩手段，而2%的通胀目标也无法突破的情况下，我们的政策选项也相当有限。
And that, ultimately, is how a relatively small boom can lead to such a large bust.	而这最终也是为何一个小泡沫会造成大萧条的原因。
	
Rebalancing the State’s Balance Sheet	重新平衡国家资产负债表
MILAN – Until recently, relatively little attention was paid to states’ balance sheets.	发自米兰 — — 直到最近，人们对世界各国资产负债表的关注一直都较少。
Measurement and reporting were neglected.	对这些数据的测算和报告都被忽略了。
Even today, states’ liabilities receive considerable attention, while their asset sides receive significantly less.	而即使是在各国负债状况受到外界普遍关注的今天，其资产状况依旧鲜有人问津。
In an earlier era, states owned substantial industrial assets.	从前各国都拥有大量的工业资产。
This “commanding heights of the economy” model was rejected largely because it seriously under-performed, especially when state-owned sectors were protected from competition (as was the norm).	但这种“占据经济制高点”的模式由于其严重表现不佳而遭到了摈弃，尤其当国有企业在竞争中受到保护时（这已经成为常态 ） 。
Efficiency declined.	效率因此降低。
But, more important, the absence of entry and exit by firms, a key ingredient of innovation, caused dynamism to suffer and losses to grow over time.	但更重要的是，缺少企业的进入或退出 — — 这才是创新的关键组成部分 — — 导致经济活力不足，其损失也随着时间的推移而不断增大。
The model’s shortcomings led to privatization in many developed and developing countries.	这种模式的缺点导致很多发达及发展中国家进行私有化。
In Europe, privatization was viewed as a key step in the integration process.	在欧洲，私有化被看作是一体化进程的关键步骤。
The theory, in Europe and elsewhere, was that states could not be impartial owners of industrial assets.	欧洲和其他地区的理念是国家不可能成为工业资产的无私持有者。
Through regulation, public procurement, and hidden subsidies, they would favor their own assets.	借助相关法律法规、政府采购以及隐性津贴，政府会偏帮它们自己名下的资产。
Of course, state ownership is not the only way to impede efficiency and dynamism.	当然，国有制并不是惟一阻碍效率与活力的因素。
Regulations in a range of countries, from Japan to Italy, create sectors that are sheltered from competition, with detrimental effects on productivity.	一些国家（从日本到意大利）的相关规定造就了一批无需参与竞争的部门，这对生产力来说是一种损害。
This pattern is particularly pronounced in the non-tradable sectors (which account for two-thirds of the economy), where the discipline of foreign competition is absent by definition.	这种模式在占整体经济规模2/3的非贸易部门显得尤其明显，国外竞争法则在这些领域是受到明令禁止的。
Even here, foreign-based domestic competitors could improve performance.	即使在笔者所在的意大利米兰，拥有国外背景的国内竞争者都有改善其表现的空间。
It is important that more attention is now paid to public liabilities – not only growing sovereign debt, but also larger, non-debt liabilities embedded in social-insurance programs.	更多地关注公共负债很重要 — — 公共负债不仅包括不断积累的主权债务，也包括那些在社会保险项目上数目更为庞大的非债务负债。
A combination of defective growth models, rising longevity, and unanticipated increases in costs (such as health care in America) have caused these longer-term liabilities to explode.	有缺陷的增长模式、不断延长的寿命与超出预计的成本增加（比如美国的医疗）一起导致了长期债务的爆发式增长。
Reining in debt and other liabilities has substantially reduced governments’ scope for sustaining demand in the face of severe negative shocks, thus reducing their ability to buy time for structural adjustment in the private sector.	债务和其它应付款项的制肘之下，政府面对严重的负面冲击时维持需求的余地也大大缩小，并因此降低了它们为私人部门进行结构性调整争取时间的能力。
For now, investment in a shift to a sustainable growth and employment pattern has been crowded out.	就目前而言，投资转向可持续发展和就业的模式已经被排挤出局。
Shifting consumption to investment via tax increases is possible, but too problematic politically, with the burden-sharing issue usually leading to impasse and inaction.	通过增税使消费转向投资是有可能的，但在政治上很成问题，因为责任由谁分担的问题往往最终会导致僵局与不作为。
Meanwhile, the asset side of states’ balance sheets remains largely invisible. States own land, mineral rights, and infrastructure.	与此同时，国家资产负债平衡表的资产一面在很大程度上仍是隐性的，比如国有土地、矿权和基础设施。
Some have sovereign wealth funds.	有些国家有主权财富基金。
Many have public pension funds of substantial magnitude, consisting of diversified portfolios of assets.	很多国家都有规模庞大的公共养老基金，并由多元化投资组合构成。
These assets are, in a sense, spoken for – there are claims on them in the form of liabilities, which have grown as expected risk-adjusted returns on assets decline; but they do represent a partial funding of public liabilities and are an element of resilience.	这些资产，某种意义上说，都已经名花有主了 — — 它们会以应付款项的形式支付给应得的人，而随着在预期中资产风险调整收益的下跌这些支付责任还有所增加；但它们的确代表了一部分公共负债的资金来源并且也是实现经济复苏的一项要素。
By contrast, in China, the asset side of the state balance sheet is very large: land, foreign-currency reserves of $3.5 trillion, and around an 85% stake in state-owned enterprises that account for about 40% of output.	相比之下，中国国家资产负债表的资产方面非常巨大：土地、外汇储蓄高达3.5万亿美元并且拥有国企85%的股份 — — 这相当于全国总产出的40 % 。
This balance-sheet configuration has helped China to respond to shocks and sustain high levels of public-sector investment.	这种资产负债结构已经帮助中国顺利应对金融冲击并维持巨额公共投资。
The liability side will expand as social insurance grows – but slowly, owing to a fear of underestimating the liabilities being created.	而这些资产的负债一面将会随着社会保险覆盖的增长而扩张 — — 但由于害怕低估即将产生的负债，这种扩张的步伐将会相对缓慢。
In the best case – without a sharp decline in financial assets accelerating an economic downturn, a sudden collapse of a defective growth model, or even rapid increases in liabilities associated with demographic shifts or health-care technology – it might make sense to focus only on controlling liabilities.	最好的情况是 — — 金融资产不会急剧下挫而导致经济衰退加速，有缺陷的增长模型不会突然崩溃，或是与人口结构转换或医疗技术相关的负债不会急剧上升 — — 这样仅仅集中精力控制负债就说得通。
But a best-case scenario provides a poor policy framework in our imperfect world.	然而这种美梦式的设想会给我们这个从不完美的世界带来差劲的政策。
In fact, states are routinely called upon to deal with a wide range of market failures or limitations: unsustainable growth patterns and regulatory myopia; distributional problems associated with the evolution of technology and globalization; accelerating concentration of national income; and major structural transitions associated with shocks and secular trends in technology and the global economy.	事实上，国家也通常被要求处理各种市场失灵或市场局限性：不可持续的增长模式和监管上的短视；与技术进步及全球化相关的分配问题；国民收入（向少数成员）的加速集中；与科技和全球经济的冲击和长期趋势相关的重要结构性转型。
Here is the dilemma: Governments with substantial assets have flexibility and the capacity to act, but they can also mismanage their assets to the detriment of markets and economic dynamism.	而困境就在于：拥有大量资产的政府拥有灵活性和行动力，但它们同时也会因资产处置失当对市场和经济活力造成破坏。
In China, where the asset side of the balance sheet is large, the strategy of shrinking it via privatization has been largely rejected, at least for now.	中国资产负债表上的资产一面非常巨大，通过私有化来对其进行收缩的策略已经被摈弃了，至少目前来说是如此。
The loss of resilience would be too great.	而失去经济复原能力的代价可能会极为巨大。
That leads to the challenge of effective management of public assets – management that promotes rather than impedes market efficiency and innovation.	这就提出了对公共资产进行有效管理的挑战 — — 这种管理应该促进而不是妨碍市场效率和创新。
Here, what might be called the pension/sovereign-wealth-fund model – in which a public entity holds and manages a diversified portfolio of assets as a financial investor with appropriately specified duties and governance – seems to be the right way to go.	在此那种可能会被称为养老金或主权财富基金的模式 — — 拥有和管理一个多样化资产组合的某个公共实体成为了一个具备特定责任和管制能力的金融投资者 ， — —似乎是一条明智的路。
The asset side of the balance sheet is maintained in the aggregate, but the management of the assets, particularly the diversification of holdings, can be thought of as prudent and de facto privatized.	资产负债表的资产一面总体维持不变，而对资产的管理 — — 尤其是所持资产的多样化 — — 可以被认为是谨慎以及事实上的私有化。
For developed countries, increasing resilience and flexibility over time by building public assets should be a long-term priority.	对发达国家来说，通过构建公共资产来提升复原能力和灵活性应该是长期的优先选择。
Periodic systemic risk affects entire economies and public finances, not only financial markets, and governments should be able to respond during periods of rapid structural change.	这回死因为周期性涌现的系统风险影响着整个经济和公共金融 — — 不仅是金融市场，而政府应当有能力在快速结构性变革的时期做出应对。
In practice, this means two things.	实际上，这意味着两件事。
First, once a collective choice is made about the desired levels of social insurance, the implied liabilities should be fully funded over time.	首先，一但作出了与社会保险所需水平相关的集体选择，其暗含的支付责任就应当得到充分的资金支持。
The alternative is a poor intergenerational burden-sharing choice.	与此相对的拙劣选择则是由几代人来分担责任。
Second, governments, like individuals, households, and businesses, need to save for a rainy day.	其二，跟个人、家庭和公司一样，政府也需要未雨绸缪。
That is all the more important in periods – like the current one – of rapid change, high volatility, and only partly predictable systemic instability.	这在那些急速变化、波动大并且系统不稳定只能被部分预测的时期 — — 正如眼前这段时间，这才是最重要的。
	
Why Support the TPP?	为何支持TPP？
CAMBRIDGE – Agreement among negotiators from 12 Pacific Rim countries on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) represents a triumph over long odds.	美国剑桥—来自12个环太平洋国家的谈判员终于在跨太平洋洋合作伙伴关系（TPP）上达成一致，这是一次非常难能可贵的胜利。
Tremendous political obstacles, both domestic and international, had to be overcome to conclude the deal.	达成协议需要克服巨大的国内和国际政治障碍。
And now critics of the TPP’s ratification, particularly in the United States, should read the agreement with an open mind.	而如今，对批准TPP持批评态度者，特别是在美国，应该以开放的态度读一读这个协议。
Many of the issues surrounding the TPP have been framed, at least in US political terms, as left versus right.	围绕TPP的诸多问题被定性为左右之争，至少在美国政治界是如此。
The left’s unremitting hostility to the deal – often on the grounds that the US Congress was kept in the dark about its content during negotiations – carried two dangers.	左派对该协议抱有坚定不移的敌意 — — 其理由常常是美国国会在谈判期间一直对内容一无所知 — — 这带曾经来了两大危险。
A worthwhile effort could have been blocked, or President Barack Obama’s Democratic administration could have been compelled to be more generous to American corporations, in order to pick up needed votes from Republicans.	一项值得为此付出的努力可能被阻挠，或总统奥巴马的民主党政府可能被迫对美国公司采取更慷慨的态度，这样才能从共和党手中争夺必需的选票。
In fact, those concerned about labor rights and the environment risked hurting their own cause.	事实上，那些关心劳工权利和环境的人可能搬起石头砸自己的脚。
By seeming to say that they would not support the TPP under any conditions, Obama had little incentive to pursue their demands.	既然他们表现出在任何条件下都不会支持TPP，那么奥巴马也就没什么动力追求他们的所求。
Seen in this light, the TPP that has emerged is a pleasant surprise.	从这个角度看，TPP可谓是意外之喜。
The agreement gives pharmaceutical firms, tobacco companies, and other corporations substantially less than they had asked for – so much so that US Senator Orrin Hatch and some other Republicans now threaten to oppose ratification.	该协议给制药企业、烟草公司和其他公司所带来的东西远远少于它们所要求的，以致于美国参议员奥林·哈奇（Orrin Hatch）和其他一些共和党威胁要反对批准TPP。
Likewise, the deal gives environmentalists more than they had bothered to ask for.	类似地，该协议给环保主义者带来的东西要多于他们所要求的。
Perhaps some of these outcomes were the result of hard bargaining by other trading partners (such as Australia).	也许这些结果中有一些是拜其他贸易伙伴（如澳大利亚）的强硬讨价还价所赐。
Regardless, the TPP’s critics should now read the specifics that they have so long said they wanted to see and reconsider their opposition to the deal.	无论如何，TPP的批评者现在应该读一读那些长期以来他们一直说想一睹为快的具体条款，并重新思考对该协议的反对态度。
The most controversial issues in the US are those that are sometimes classified as “deep integration,” because they go beyond the traditional easing of trade tariffs and quotas.	在美国，最具争议性的问题那些有时被归类为“深度一体化”的问题，因为它们超过了传统的放松贸易关税和配额的范畴。
The left’s concerns about labor and the environment were accompanied by fears about excessive benefits for corporations: protection of the intellectual property of pharmaceutical and other companies, and the mechanisms used to settle disputes between investors and states.	左派对劳工和环境的关注伴随着对公司过度获益的担忧：对制药公司和其他公司知识产权的保护以及用于解决投资者和国家纠纷的机制。
So what, exactly, is in the finished TPP?	那么，已完成的TPP究竟包含了些什么？
Among the environmental features, two stand out.	在环境方面，有两点特别引人注目。
The agreement includes substantial steps to enforce the prohibitions contained in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).	TPP包括了执行写入国际濒危物种国际贸易公约（CITES）的禁令的重大措施。
It also takes substantial steps to limit subsidies for fishing fleets – which in many countries waste taxpayer money and accelerate the depletion of marine life.	它还规定了重大措施限制对捕鱼船队的补贴 — — 在许多国家，这一补贴浪费了纳税人的钱，也加速了海洋生物的耗竭。
For the first time, apparently, these environmental measures will be backed up by trade sanctions.	显然，这些环境措施是第一次得到贸易制裁的支持。
I wish that certain environmental groups had devoted half as much time and energy ascertaining the potential for such good outcomes as they did to sweeping condemnations of the negotiating process.	我希望某些环保组织可以拿出它们用于大肆谴责谈判过程一半的时间和精力用于研究这些好结果的潜力。
The critics apparently were too busy to notice when the agreement on fishing subsidies was reached in Maui in July.	批评者显然太忙了，以致于他们没有注意到关于渔业补贴的协议7月在毛伊岛就已经达成。
But it is not too late for environmentalists to get on board.	但环保主义者现在开始努力也不晚。
Similarly, various provisions in the area of labor practices, particularly in Southeast Asia, are progressive.	类似地，劳工实践领域的诸多条款，特别是在东南亚，也具有进步性。
These include measures to promote union rights in Vietnam and steps to crack down on human trafficking in Malaysia.	这些条款包括促进越南工会权利的措施和打击马来西亚人口贩卖的措施。
Perhaps the greatest uncertainty concerned the extent to which big US corporations would get what they wanted in the areas of investor-government dispute settlement and intellectual property protection.	也许最大的不确定性在于美国大公司能在多大程度上在投资者-政府纠纷解决和知识产权保护等领域得偿所愿。
The TPP’s critics often neglected to acknowledge that international dispute-settlement mechanisms could ever serve a valid purpose, or that some degree of patent protection is needed if pharmaceutical companies are to have sufficient incentive to invest in research and development.	TPP批评者常常不承认国际纠纷解决机制能够有助于合理目的，或者，要让制药公司有足够的激励投资于研发就必须进行一定程度的专利保护。
There was, of course, a danger that such protections for corporations could go too far.	当然，一个危险是对公司的保护走得太远。
The dispute-settlement provisions might have interfered unreasonably with member countries’ anti-smoking campaigns, for example.	比如，纠纷解决条款也许会不合理地干扰成员国的禁烟运动。
But, in the end, the tobacco companies did not get what they had been demanding; Australia is now free to ban brand-name logos on cigarette packs.	但是，最终，烟草公司并没有得偿所愿；如今，澳大利亚大可以禁止在香烟包装盒上出现商标名标志。
The TPP also sets other new safeguards against the misuse of the dispute-settlement mechanism.	TPP还规定了防止纠纷解决机制滥用的新条款。
Likewise, the intellectual property protections might have established a 12-year monopoly on the data that US pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies compile on new drugs (particularly biologics), thereby impeding competition from lower-cost generic versions.	类似地，知识产权保护已经为美国制药和生物科技公司建立了12年的新药（特别是生物制药）数据垄断，从而阻止来自成本更低的仿制药的竞争。
In the end, these companies did not get all they wanted; while the TPP in some ways gives their intellectual property more protection than they had before, it assures protection of their data for only 5-8 years.	最后，这些公司没有得到想要的一切；尽管TPP以某种方式给了它们比以前更多的知识产权保护，但对于它们的新药数据，保护期只有5—8年。
The focus on new areas of deep integration should not obscure the old-fashioned free-trade benefits that are also part of the TPP: reducing thousands of existing tariff and non-tariff barriers.	关注深度一体化的新领域不应该忽视老牌 自由贸易益处，它们也是TPP的一部分：降低了数千种现有关税和非关税壁垒。
Liberalization will affect manufacturing sectors such as the automotive industry, as well as services, including the Internet.	自由化将影响到汽车业等制造业，也将影响��包括互联网在内的服务业。
Liberalization of agriculture – long a stubborn holdout in international trade negotiations – is noteworthy.	农业自由化 — — 长期以来一直在顽固地拒绝在国际贸易谈判门外 — — 也值得关注。
Countries like Japan have agreed to let in more dairy products, sugar, beef, and rice from more efficient producers in countries like New Zealand and Australia.	日本等国家同意来自新西兰和澳大利亚等国家的效率更高的生产商的奶制品、糖、牛肉和大米进入国内。
In all these areas and more, traditional textbook arguments about the gains from trade apply: new export opportunities lead to higher wages and a lower cost of living.	在所有这些和其他领域，关于贸易的益处的传统教科书观点都适用：新的进口机会带来更高的工资和更低的生活成本。
Many citizens and politicians made up their minds about TPP long ago, based on seemingly devastating critiques of what might emerge from the negotiations.	许多公民和政客对TPP的看法在很久以前便已形成，并且是基于对谈判可能结果的毁灭性批评。
They should now look at the outcome with an open mind.	现在，他们应该带着开放心态看一看谈判结果。
They just might find that their worst nighttime fears have vanished by the light of day.	他们会发现，他们最糟糕的噩梦情景已经消失在朗朗乾坤之下。
	
Europe’s Non-Deal of the Century	欧洲世纪性交易的失败
BRUSSELS – As Europe picks over the ruins of the mega-merger that would have created a world-beating new aerospace and defense giant, questions are being asked about the inglorious role that the European Union played in the fiasco.	布鲁塞尔 — — 随着欧洲在本应缔造出令世人震惊的全新航空航天及国防巨头的巨型合并所遗留的废墟上挑挑拣拣，人们不禁要问欧盟在这场惨败中究竟扮演了哪些不光彩的角色。
The European Commission’s failure to champion the $50 billion merger of the Franco-German European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), owner of Airbus, and the United Kingdom’s BAE Systems is being seen as a crucial factor in the deal’s collapse.	欧盟委员会未能支持空客所有者法德欧洲航空防务及航天公司（EADS）及英国BAE系统公司案值500亿美元的合并，这被外界普遍视为此次交易失败的关键因素。
The integration of the two high-tech aviation and avionics leaders had looked like an EU-inspired blueprint for industrial success.	这两家航空和航空电子技术领导企业的合并曾视作为欧盟工业腾飞的创意蓝图。
For several years, EU leaders have been urging the consolidation of Europe’s defense industries, so the proposed deal – which originated in the corporate boardrooms of EADS and BAE Systems – looked like an answer to their calls.	若干年来，欧盟领导人一直敦促整合欧洲国防工业，于是此次由EADS和BAE系统公司董事会提出的合并议案就像在响应他们的号召。
Yet both the Commission and the European Parliament kept silent and withheld the political support that might have ensured that the deal went through.	但欧盟委员会和欧洲议会却不约而同地选择保持沉默，没有提供确保此次交易顺利达成所需的政治支持。
A timely reminder by EU leaders of the strategic importance of the aerospace sector would have helped allay many of the misgivings in Berlin, and to a lesser degree in London, that ultimately sank the deal.	由欧盟领导人出面及时提醒人们航空航天产业的战略重要性或许有助于打消柏林抱有的众多疑虑，但对最终否决交易的伦敦却起不到多少作用。
Aviation, like defense, is the sharpest of the R&D cutting edges available to advanced countries, and regularly produces key technological breakthroughs.	航空和国防一样位列先进国家尖端科技研发的最前沿，往往能够产生关键性的技术突破。
Nationalist squabbles over the details of the merger would surely have been attenuated by a statesmanlike intervention from the Commission in Brussels.	布鲁塞尔欧盟委员会的政治干预原本应当可以弱化由合并细节所引发的民族主义争吵。
It was therefore a bizarre coincidence that the merger’s collapse came on the day that the Commission unveiled its new industrial strategy for regaining Europe’s competitive edge in the face of Asian and North American competition.	于是成就了一个奇怪的巧合，即合并失败和欧盟委员会公布其在面对亚洲和北美竞争时重新夺回欧洲竞争优势的全新产业战略就发生在同一天。
One of the most powerful arguments for the EADS-BAE marriage had been the expectation of industry analysts that within 20 years China will challenge Airbus and Boeing in the global aviation market, while also creating a powerful new defense industry.	EADS与BAE联姻最有力的理由是行业分析家预测在20年内，中国将在成就强大的全新国防工业的同时，对空客和波音在全球航空市场的地位形成挑战。
That scenario now looks all the more likely.	目前来看这样的情况更有可能出现。
Why, then, did the European Commission remain silent?	既然如此，欧盟委员会为什么保持沉默？
The answer appears to be that it feared negative reactions from the three governments involved in the merger talks, and believed that its own authority would suffer from any public rebuff.	答案似乎是担心涉事的三国政府参与合并谈判可能带来的消极反应，并且深信任何公众抗拒情绪将会有损于委员会自身的权威。
The persistent rumor circulating among defense company executives is that soon after news of the proposed merger leaked, the weekly commissioners’ meeting chaired by Commission President José Manuel Barroso was enjoined to keep silent on the matter in order to avoid any potential dangers.	国防公司高管圈内一直流传着这样的谣言，即在合并提案消息泄露后，由委员会主席若泽·曼努埃尔·巴罗佐主持的委员会每周例会责成对此事件保持沉默，以避免陷入可能引发的麻烦。
Whether true or not, the important point is that the merger transcended national considerations, and the European Commission had a duty to involve itself.	无论传言是真是假，重要的是合并超越了国家的考量范畴，欧盟委员会有责任参与其中。
The EU’s executive body is meant to be the driving force behind Europe’s efforts to revive laggard industries and fight to reverse the long-term economic decline that the eurozone crisis appears to presage.	欧盟执行机构本就应该推动欧洲复苏其落后产业并力争扭转欧元区危机似乎预示的长期经济衰退的努力。
Nobody is arguing that the Commission is responsible for the deal’s unhappy end – only that it should have rallied support for it.	没有人认为欧洲委员会应当对交易不圆满的结果负责，只是说它本来应当给予相应的支持。
The significance of the merger’s collapse is now becoming clear to observers across Europe, especially in Germany, where the media have been extremely critical of how “negative politics” sealed the proposed merger’s fate.	欧洲各国（特别是德国）观察家现在已经意识到合并失败将会产生的重大后果。 德国媒体一直对“消极政治”如何决定合并提案的命运持有极端批评的态度。
With the EU in the throes of the seemingly endless eurozone sovereign-debt crisis and facing a looming debate over its future decision-making architecture, the collapse of the EADS-BAE merger will be no more than a footnote in the history books.	在欧盟正在承受看似无休无止的欧元区主权债务危机所���来的痛苦并且对未来决策架构的探讨已经迫在眉睫的情况下，EADS和BAE的合并失败恐怕仅仅是历史书上的一个脚注。
But it may be said to mark the point when the European Commission openly acknowledged that it has become little more than a secretariat to EU governments.	但可以说这次合并失败标志着欧盟委员会公开承认自己已沦为欧盟各国政府的秘书处。
That is a far cry from the political powerhouse that some Europeans fear – and for which others still hope.	这与某些欧洲人所担心的强力政治机构相去甚远 — — 强力政治机构仍然是有些人所追求的目标。
	
Should Central Banks Target Employment?	中央银行应该把目标定在就业上吗？
WASHINGTON, DC – On December 12, US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke announced that the Fed will keep interest rates at close to zero until the unemployment rate falls to 6.5%, provided inflation expectations remain subdued.	华盛顿—12月12日，美联储主席伯南克宣布美联储将一直保持利率近零水平直至失业率降到6.5 % ， 只要通胀预期保持可控。
While the Fed’s governing statutes, unlike those of the European Central Bank, explicitly include a mandate to support employment, the announcement marked the first time that the Fed tied its interest-rate policy to a numerical employment target.	美联储的治理权限 — — 与欧洲央行不同 — — 明文规定包括支持就业的指令权，但伯南克的话是标志着美联储第一次将其利率政策与就业数字目标挂钩。
It is a welcome breakthrough, and one that should be emulated by others – not least the ECB.	这是一个值得欢迎的突破，应该被其他央行所效仿 — — 不仅仅是欧洲央行。
Central banks’ statutes differ in terms of the objectives that they set for monetary policy.	中央银行的权限因它们为货币政策设定的目标的不同而不同。
All include price stability.	所有央行的目标都包括价格稳定。
Many add a reference to general economic conditions, including growth and employment or financial stability.	不少央行还加上了总体经济状况（包括增长和就业或是金融稳定）内容。
Some give the central bank the authority to set an inflation target unilaterally; others stipulate coordination with the government in setting the target.	一些国家给予央行单方面决定通胀目标的权力，一些国家则要求央行与政府合作设定这一目标。
There is no recent example, however, of a major central bank setting a numerical employment target.	但是，近年来从未有主要国家的央行设定就业数字目标。
This should change, as the size of the employment challenge facing the advanced economies becomes more apparent.	这应该发生改变，因为发达国家所面临的就业挑战规模日益显著。
Weak labor markets, low inflation, and debt overhang suggest that a fundamental re-ordering of priorities is in order.	疲软的劳动力市场、低通胀和债务积压意味着需要将对各项任务来一次根本性重新排序。
In Japan, Shinzo Abe, the incoming prime minister, is signaling the same set of concerns, although he seems to be proposing a “minimum” inflation target for the Bank of Japan, rather than a link to growth or employment.	在日本，即将出任首相的安倍晋三也释放出同样的信号，尽管他准备为日本银行设定一个“最低”通胀目标，而不是与通胀或就业挂钩。
The spread of global value-chains that integrate hundreds of millions of developing-country workers into the global economy, as well as new labor-saving technologies, imply little chance of cost-push wage inflation.	全球价值链的扩大将数亿发展中国家工人以及劳动力节约型技术与全球经济融为一体，这意味着成本推动型工资通胀几无可能发生。
Likewise, the market for long-term bonds indicates extremely low inflation expectations (of course, interest rates are higher in cases of perceived sovereign default or re-denomination risk, such as in Southern Europe, but that has nothing to do with inflation).	类似地，长期债券市场表明，通胀预期极低（当然，利率在人们感觉存在主权违约风险和重新计价风险时会有所增加，南欧便是明证，但这和通胀无��� ） 。
Moreover, the deleveraging underway since the 2008 financial implosion could be easier if inflation were moderately higher for a few years, a debate the International Monetary Fund encouraged a year ago.	此外，如果通胀在未来数年略有上升，2008年金融危机爆发以来的去杠杆化也会更加容易，IMF在一年前就鼓励讨论这样做。
Together with these considerations, policymakers should take into account the tremendous human and economic costs of high unemployment, ranging from the millions of shattered lives, skills erosion, and disappearance of opportunities for an entire generation, to the dead-weight loss of idle human resources.	除了这些考虑，决策者还应该考虑高失业带来的巨大人力和经济成本，包括数百万对生活失去信心的人、技能损失、一整代人丧失机会、闲置人力资源的平白浪费等。
Is the failure to ensure that millions of young people acquire the skills required to participate in the economy not as great a liability for a society as a large stock of public debt?	对于一个对社会来说是一笔大负债但更是一笔巨额公共债务存量的经济，其失败能否保证千百万年轻人能够获得参与其中的技能？
Nowhere is this reordering of priorities more needed than in the eurozone.	最需要对任务重要性重新排序非欧元区莫属。
Yet, strangely, it is the Fed, not the ECB, that has set an unemployment target.	但是，奇怪的是，美联储而不是欧洲央行设定了通胀目标。
The US unemployment rate has declined to around 7.7% and the current-account deficit is close to $500 billion, while eurozone unemployment is at a record high, near 12%, and the current account shows a surplus approaching $100 billion.	美国失业率已降至7.7 % ， 经常项目赤字接近5 000亿美元，而欧元区失业率达到了创纪录的近12 % ， 经常项目盈余近1 000亿美元。
If the ECB’s inflation target were 3%, rather than close to but below 2%, and Germany, with the world’s largest current-account surplus, encouraged 6% wage growth and tolerated 4% inflation – implying modest real-wage growth in excess of expected productivity gains – the eurozone adjustment process would become less politically and economically costly.	如果欧洲央行的通胀目标是3%而不是接近但低于2 % ， 且世界最大经常项目盈余国德国将工资提高6%并容忍4%的通胀 — — 这意味着真实工资增长略高于预期生产率增长 — — 则欧元区调整过程的政治和经济代价将会更小。
Indeed, the policy calculus in Northern Europe greatly underestimates the economic losses due to the disruptions imposed on the South by excessive austerity and wage deflation.	事实上，北欧的政策算盘大大地低估了过度紧缩和工资通缩给南欧造成的影响以及由此产生的经济损失。
The resulting high levels of youth unemployment, health problems, and idle production capacity also all have a substantial impact on demand for imports from the North.	随之而来的年轻人高失业率、医疗问题和产能闲置也对北欧出口商品需求带来了巨大冲击。
Contrary to conventional wisdom, the ECB’s legal mandate would allow such a re-ordering of priorities, as, with reference to the ECB, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that “The primary (emphasis added) objective of the European System of Central Banks…shall be to maintain price stability,” and there is another part of the Treaty dealing with general eurozone economic policies that emphasizes employment.	与传统智慧相反，欧洲央行的法定权力允许这样的任务优先顺序重排，因为对于欧洲央行 ， 《 欧盟运行条约》规定“欧洲中央银行体系的主要（特别强调）目标是 … … 保持价格稳定 ” ， 而对于强调就业的欧元区总体经济政策，该条约另有条文规定。
This would seem not to preclude a temporary complementary employment objective for the ECB at a time of exceptional challenge.	这似乎并不妨碍欧洲央行在面临重大挑战时暂时补充以就业目标。
Moreover, the ECB has the authority to set the eurozone-wide inflation target, and could set it higher for two or three years, without any treaty violation.	此外，欧洲央行有设定泛欧元区通胀目标的权力，可以在两三年内将其设在较高水平而不违反条约。
The real problem is the current political attitude in Germany.	真正的问题在于德国的政治态度。
Somehow, the memory of hyperinflation in the early 1920’s seems scarier than that of massive unemployment in the early 1930’s, although it was the latter that fueled the rise of Nazism.	然而，20世纪20年代恶性通胀的记忆似乎比20世纪30年代初大规模失业的记忆更为惨痛，尽管后者才是导致纳粹上台的原因。
Maybe the upcoming German elections will allow progressive forces to clarify what is at stake for Germany and Europe – indeed, the entire world.	或许即将到来的德国选举将让进步力量澄清德国和欧洲 — — 事实上是全世界 — — 所面临的危机。
In a more global context, none of this is to dismiss the longer-term dangers of inflation.	从全球角度看，所有这些都没有消除长期通胀危险。
In most countries, at most times, inflation should be kept very low – and central banks should anchor inflation expectations with a stable long-term target, although the alternative of targeting nominal GDP deserves to be discussed.	在大部分时候的大部分国家，通胀都应该维持在极低水平，央行也应该通过稳定的长期目标锚定通胀预期，尽管如此，将目标改为名义GDP的替代方案也值得考虑。
Moreover, monetary policy cannot be a long-term substitute for structural reforms and sustainable budgets.	此外，货币政策不可能长期代替结构性改革和可持续预算。
Long periods of zero real interest rates carry the danger of asset bubbles, misallocation of resources, and unintended effects on income inequality, as recent history – not least in the US and Japan – demonstrates.	长期零真实利率会带来资产泡沫、资源配置不当和意料之外的收入不平等等风险，最近的历史（不仅仅是美国和日本）证明了这一点。
For the coming 2-3 years, however, particularly in Europe, the need for deleveraging, the costs of widespread joblessness, and the risk of social collapse make the kind of temporary unemployment target announced by the Fed highly desirable.	但是，在未来2—3年，特别是在欧洲，去杠杆化的需要、失业高企的成本以及社会崩溃的风险让美联储所宣布的临时性失业目标显得极为合理。
	
Mario Draghi’s Opiate of the Markets	市场的德拉吉鸦片
CHICAGO – From the standpoint of European stability, the Italian elections could not have delivered a worse outcome.	芝加哥—站在欧洲稳定的立场看，意大利选举结果可谓坏到了极点。
Italy’s parliament is divided among three mutually incompatible political forces, with none strong enough to rule alone.	意大利议会分裂为三个互不相容的政治阵营，没有一个强大到足以单独执政。
Worse, one of these forces, which won 25% of the vote, is an anti-euro populist party, while another, a Euro-skeptic group led by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, received close to 30% support, giving anti-euro parties a clear majority.	更糟糕的是，其中一个获得了25%选票的阵营是反欧元民粹主义政党，另外一个支持率近30%的阵营是前总理贝卢斯科尼领导的欧元怀疑派，这使得反欧元政党占据明显多数。
Despite these scary results, the interest-rate spread for Italian government bonds relative to German bunds has increased by only 40 basis points since the election.	尽管结果令人担忧，但选举以来意大利政府债券相对德国国债的利差只上升了40个基点。
In July 2012, when a pro-European, austerity-minded government was running the country, with the well-respected economist Mario Monti in charge, the spread reached 536 basis points.	2012年6月，执政意大利的是紧缩派政府，政府首脑是德高望重的经济学家蒙蒂，此时的利差为536个基点。
Today, with no government and little chance that a decent one will be formed soon, the spread sits at 314 points.	如今，陷入无政府状态、且没有任何迹象表明会在不久的将来形成得体政府的意大利，利差只有314个基点。
So, are markets bullish about Italy, or have they lost their ability to assess risk?	那么，是市场看好意大利，还是市场失去了评估风险的能力？
A recent survey of international investors conducted by Morgan Stanley suggests that they are not bullish.	摩根士丹利进行的最新国际投资者调查表明，投资者并不看好意大利。
Forty-six percent of the respondents said that the most likely outcome for Italy is an interim administration and new elections.	46%受访者声称意大利最有可能的结果是过渡政府+新选举。
And they regard this outcome as the worst-case scenario, one that implies a delay of any further economic measures, deep policy uncertainty, and the risk of an even less favorable electoral outcome.	他们认为这一结果堪称最坏情形，意味着进一步经济措施将被推迟、政策面临极大的不稳定性，并有可能形成更加不利的选举结果。
The survey also clearly indicated why the interest-rate spread for Italian government bonds is not much wider: the perceived backstop provided by the European Central Bank.	调查还明确显示了为何意大利政府债券利差没有显著加大：人们感到欧洲央行在支持意大利。
Although investors believe that the backstop is unlikely to be used, its mere presence dissuades them from betting against Italy.	尽管投资者认为这一支持不可能成为实际动作，但仅仅是有支持存在便足以促使他们不再看空意大利。
In other words, the “outright monetary transactions” (OMT) scheme announced by ECB President Mario Draghi last July has served as the proverbial “bazooka” – a gun so powerful that it does not need to be used.	换句话说，欧洲央行行长德拉吉去年7月宣布的“直接货币交易 ” （ OMT）机制已经成了“火箭炮”的代名词 — — 这个武器威力如此巨大，以致于根本不必真正拿出来使用。
Then-US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson sought a bazooka during the 2008 financial crisis.	时任美国财政部长保尔森在2008年金融危机期间就祭出过类似的火箭炮。
He failed, because he believed that even a fake gun would work if it looked scary enough.	他失败了，因为他认为只要气势汹汹，就算是假枪也能奏效。
Not falling for the trick, speculators repeatedly called his bluff.	投资者并不买账，一再戳穿了他的虚张声势。
Draghi, with his famous pledge to do “whatever it takes” to ensure the euro’s survival, succeeded where Paulson did not.	德拉吉的著名承诺 — — “不惜一切代价”确保欧元生存正是成功在保尔森的失败之处。
After all, he controls the monetary spigot.	毕竟，他控制着货币龙头。
But even Draghi’s bazooka is partly a bluff.	但即使是德拉吉的火箭炮，也有一半是虚张声势。
Draghi designed it to relieve the ECB of the huge political responsibility of deciding when to save a country from default.	德拉吉的火箭炮是用来纾解欧洲央行决定何时拯救一国走出违约困境的政治责任压力的。
For this reason, triggering the OMT mechanism requires the unanimous consent of eurozone governments.	出于这一理由，出发OMT机制要求欧元区各国政府的一致同意。
But, if the bazooka is needed, how likely is it to be fired before the German election in September?	但是，如果火箭炮真的需要开炮，有多少可能能够在9月德国选举之前实现？
The Morgan Stanley survey did not ask this question, probably because everybody knows the answer: not likely at all.	摩根士丹利的调查并没有问道这一问题，其原因也许在于所有人都知道答案：根本没有可能。
Thus, markets remain calm because they expect the bazooka not to be needed.	因此，市场之所以保持冷静，是因为市场预期德拉吉的火箭炮不会真的使用。
In that case, the fact that it cannot be triggered easily does not pose a significant problem.	果真如此的话，火箭炮不会轻易发射这一事实并不构成严重问题。
Its presence is enough to support a benign self-fulfilling prophecy.	它的存在已足以支持良性的自我实现预言。
In other words, Draghi’s bazooka has anesthetized markets, impairing their ability to assess risk.	换句话说，德拉吉的火箭炮麻醉了市场，是它丧失了评估风险的能力。
But as with all anesthetics, Draghi’s cannot and will not last forever.	但它的麻醉作用再大，也无法也不会永远持续。
Either the underlying problem is fixed before the patient wakes up, or the pain will be devastating.	要么根本问题在耐心耗尽前得到解决，要么发生灾难性的痛苦事件。
The investors surveyed by Morgan Stanley put the chance of a renewed crisis in Italy below 25%.	摩根士丹利所调查的投资者认为意大利危机重新爆发的几率不到25 % 。
I believe that it is higher than 50%.	我认为高于50 % 。
Even after Germany’s election, I am not sure that the government will be willing to support an Italian rescue program without asking for major guarantees concerning the objectives – and even the composition – of Italy’s ruling coalition.	即使在德国选举之后，我仍不确定德国政府愿意支持意大利援助计划而不要求获得关于意大利执政联盟目标 — — 甚至其组成 — — 的重大承诺。
Indeed, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will face a serious dilemma following her likely re-election.	事实上，德国总理默克尔将在可能的连任后面临一个严重的两难。
Without strict conditionality, she would risk shifting the domestic consensus in favor of Germany’s emerging Euro-skeptic mood.	如果不要求严苛的条件，她可能会让国内一致观点倒向新崛起的怀疑欧元派。
But, by insisting on such conditionality, she would trigger a huge political crisis in Europe. If the German government gets to decide who governs Italy, why should Italians bother voting?	如果德国政府能够决定谁来治理意大利，那���意大利人还要选举干什么？
The eurozone will look like a German protectorate, rather than a voluntary union of sovereign countries.	欧元区则像是德国的保护国，而不是主权国家组成的自愿联盟。
The political backlash would be enormous.	其政治反响将会极其激烈。
The only hope is that the eurozone makes strong progress toward establishing fiscal-redistribution mechanisms, such as European unemployment insurance, before Draghi’s anesthetic wears off.	唯一的希望是欧元区在德拉吉的麻药失去药效前朝着成立财政再分配机制的方向去的重大进步，比如形成欧洲失业保险制度。
Otherwise, Europe will face a very rude awakening indeed.	否则的话，欧洲将面临极其痛苦的未来。
	
China’s American Bailout?	中国的 美国援助？
ZURICH – The twenty-first-century economy has thus far been shaped by capital flows from China to the United States – a pattern that has suppressed global interest rates, helped to reflate the developed world’s leverage bubble, and, through its impact on the currency market, fueled China’s meteoric rise.	苏黎世—到目前为止，21世纪的经济由中国向美国的资本流决定着 — — 这一模式压低了全球利率，帮助发达世界杠杆泡沫再次膨胀，并通过在货币市场的影响助长了中国的迅速崛起。
But these were no ordinary capital flows.	但这不是普通的资本流。
Rather than being driven by direct or portfolio investment, they came primarily from the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), as it amassed $3.5 trillion in foreign reserves – largely US Treasury securities.	它不是由直接投资或组合投资驱动的，而主要来自中国人民银行，后者囤积了3.5万亿美元外汇储备，其中大部分是美国国债。
The fact that a single institution wields so much influence over global macroeconomic trends has caused considerable anxiety, with doomsayers predicting that doubts about US debt sustainability will force China to sell off its holdings of US debt.	一个机构对全球宏观经济趋势施加了如此之大的影响，这引起了大规模的不安，末日预言家纷纷表示对美国债务可持续性的怀疑将迫使美国甩卖其持有的美国债务。
This would drive up interest rates in the US and, ultimately, could trigger the dollar’s collapse.	这将推高美国利率，并最终触发美元的崩溃。
But selling off US Treasury securities, it was argued, was not in China’s interest, given that it would drive up the renminbi’s exchange rate against the dollar, diminishing the domestic value of China’s reserves and undermining the export sector’s competitiveness.	这一观点指出，甩卖美国国债并不符合中国的利益，因为这会推高人民币对美元汇率，降低中国储备的本币价值，破坏出口部门的竞争力。
Indeed, a US defense department report last year on the national-security implications of China’s holdings of US debt concluded that “attempting to use US Treasury securities as a coercive tool would have limited effect and likely would do more harm to China than to the [US].”	事实上，去年美国国防部的一百分报告分析了中国所持美国债务对国家安全的影响，结论是“试图将美国国债作为强制工具使用效果有限，对中国的危害比对[美国]更大 。 ”
To describe the symbiotic relationship between China’s export-led GDP growth and America’s excessive consumption, the economic historians Niall Ferguson and Moritz Schularick coined the term “Chimerica.”	经济史学家弗格森（Niall Ferguson）和舒拉里克（Moritz Schularick）创造了“中美国 ” （ Chimerica）一词来形容中国的出口导向型GDP增长和美国的过度消费之间的共生关系。
The invocation of the chimera of Greek mythology – a monstrous, fire-breathing amalgam of lion, goat, and dragon – makes the term all the more appropriate, given that Chimerica has generated massive and terrifying distortions in the global economy that cannot be corrected without serious consequences.	希腊神话式的幻想 — — 狮子、山羊和龙的混合体喷火怪兽 — — 让这个词更加合适了，因为中美国给全球经济带来了巨大的、令人恐怖的扭曲，纠正这一扭曲必然会带来严重后果。
In 2009, these distortions led Ferguson and Schularick to forecast Chimerica’s collapse – a prediction that seems to be coming true.	2009年，这一扭曲促使弗格森和舒拉里克预言中国将崩溃 — — 这一预言似乎即将实现。
With the reserves’ long-term effects on China’s internal economic dynamics finally taking hold, selling off foreign-exchange reserves is now in China’s interest.	随着外汇储备对中国内部经济动态的长期影响最终显现，如今甩卖外汇储备已经符合中国的利益。
Over the last decade, the vast quantities of short-term capital that were being pumped into China’s banking system drove commercial banks and other financial institutions to expand credit substantially, especially through the shadow-banking system, leading to a massive credit bubble and severe over-investment.	在过去十年中，大量涌入中国银行系统的短期资本促使商业银行和其他金融机构大量扩张信用，特别是通过影子银行系统进行扩张，这导致了巨大的信用泡沫和严重的过度投资。
In order to manage the resulting increase in risk, China’s new leaders are now refusing to provide further liquidity injections, as well as curbing loans to unprofitable sectors.	为了应对因此增加的风险，如今中国新领导人拒绝进一步注入流动性，并遏制贷款流向无盈利能力的部门。
But these efforts could trigger a financial crisis, requiring China to initiate a major recapitalization of the banking system.	但这些措施可能引发金融危机，使中国不得不进行大规模的银行系统资本重组。
In such a scenario, non-performing loans in China’s banking system would probably amount to roughly $1 trillion.	在这一情形下，中国银行系统的不良贷款可能会达到1万亿美元左右。
The most obvious means of recapitalizing China’s banks would be to inject renminbi-denominated government debt into the banking sector.	对中资银行进行资本重组最显而易见的方式是向银行部门注入人民币计价的政府债务。
But China’s total public debt, including off-balance-sheet local-government financing vehicles, probably amounts to around 70% of GDP already.	但中国总公债水平 — — 包括表外的地方政府融资平台 — — 可能已经达到了GDP的70%左右。
Despite debate over the details, the conclusion of Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff – that a high debt/GDP ratio can inhibit economic growth – remains widely accepted; so it is unlikely that raising the debt ratio to 100% would be in China’s long-term interest.	尽管细节存在争议，但莱因哈特（Carmen Reinhart）和罗格夫（Kenneth Rogoff）的结论 — — 高债务/GDP比率会抑制经济增长 — — 仍被广泛接受；因此，将让债务比率升至100%显然不符合中国的长期利益。
Even if China’s leaders decided that they had the necessary fiscal latitude to pursue such a strategy, they probably would not, owing to the risk of inflation, which, perhaps more than any other economic variable, tends to lead to social unrest.	即使中国领导人认为他们拥有必要的财政空间事实这一战略，他们也有可能因为通胀风险而不这么做。 通胀风险比其他任何经济变量更有可能导致社会动荡。
Given this, in the event of a crisis, China would most likely have to begin selling off its massive store of US debt.	基于此，若发生危机，中国极有可能不得不开始甩卖其手中的巨量美国债务。
Fortunately for China, the negative consequences of such a move would probably be far less severe than previously thought.	对中国来说，幸运的是这一动作的消极后果可能远没有此前设想的严重。
To be sure, an injection of US Treasuries into the banking sector, and their subsequent conversion to renminbi, would still strengthen China’s currency.	平心而论，将美国国债注入银行部门并在随后转换为人民币仍可以强化中国货币。
But the rise would most likely be offset by capital outflows, as looser capital controls would enable savers to escape the financial crisis.	但因为较松的资本管制使储蓄者可以逃避金融危机，升值极有可能被资本外流抵消。
Moreover, even if the renminbi became stronger in the short term, China is no longer as dependent on maintaining export competitiveness as it once was, given that, excluding assembly and reprocessing, exports now contribute less than 5% of China’s GDP.	此外，即使人民币在短期有所升值，中国也不再能像从前那样依赖于维持出口竞争力，因为剔除组装和再加工业务，出口目前只占中国GDP的5 % 。
Against this background, the US Federal Reserve, rather than focusing only on “tapering” its monthly purchases of long-term securities (quantitative easing), must prepare itself for a potential sell-off of US debt.	与这一背景相对的是，美联储不能专注于依靠“减弱”其每月长期证券购买量（量化宽松 ） ， 还必须做好准备面对可能发生的美国债务甩卖。
Given that a Fed-funded recapitalization of China’s banking system would negate the impact of monetary policy at home, driving up borrowing costs and impeding GDP growth, the Fed should be ready to sustain quantitative easing in the event of a Chinese financial crisis.	美联储提供融资的中国银行系统的资本重组将使货币政策在国内失效，推高借贷成本并阻碍GDP增长，因此美联储应该做好准备在中国爆发金融危机时维持量化宽松。
After spending years attempting to insulate the US economy from the upshot of its own banking crisis, the Fed may ultimately be forced to bail out China’s banks, too.	美联储花了多年时间让美国经济不再受其自身银行危机的影响，到头来还得被迫援助中国的银行。
This would fundamentally redefine – and, one hopes, rebalance – US-China relations.	这将从根本上重塑中美关系 — — 我们希望是再平衡。
	
Why the Fed Should Postpone Rate Hikes	为何美联储应该暂停升息
JACKSON HOLE, WYOMING – As central bankers from around the world gather this week in Jackson Hole for the Federal Reserve’s annual Economic Policy Symposium, one key topic of discussion will be the current global stock-market turmoil.	杰克森霍尔，怀俄明州—本周，全球央行行长将齐聚杰克森霍尔（Jackson Hole ） ， 出席一年一度的美联储经济政策讨论会。 讨论会的一个重要议题是当前股市动荡。
There are many reasons for these gyrations, but the expectation that the Fed will start to raise interest rates – perhaps as early as September – is clearly one of them.	动荡的原因有很多，但预期美联储将开始升息 — — 也许从9月份就会开始 — — 显然是其中之一。
The arguments for a rate hike are valid.	支持升息的理由很充分。
The United States’ economy is gaining traction.	美国经济正在重获动力。
The International Monetary Fund forecasts 3% annual growth in 2015 and 2016, accompanied by inflation rates of 0.1% and 1.5%, respectively.	国际货币基金组织（IMF）预测2015和2016年增长率为3 % ， 对应通胀率分别为0.1%和1.5 % 。
When an economy is normalizing, it is reasonable to reduce expansionary measures, such as those introduced after the crisis of 2008.	当经济开始正常化时，减少扩张政策（比如2008年危机后实施的那些）再合理不过了。
Because the Fed has clearly communicated that it will move gradually toward less expansionary policies, its credibility would be damaged if it did not follow through.	美联储早就明确表示它将逐渐减少扩张性政策，因此，如果它不那么做，信誉就会收到影响。
But there are strong reasons for the Fed to postpone interest-rate hikes and to keep monetary policy expansionary over the coming quarters.	但有很好的理由认为美联储应该暂停升息，并在未来几个季度保持货币政策扩张。
For starters, the US recovery remains weak.	首先，美国复苏仍然疲软。
Historically, 3% growth during a recovery is far from impressive.	从历史看，复苏期间3%的增长绝算不上漂亮。
In other recent recoveries, growth often hit 4% or even 5% when increased capacity utilization pushed up productivity and investment.	在其他几次最近的复苏中，随着产能利用率的提高助推生产率和投资，增长率常常达到4%甚至5 % 。
Over the past three decades, the US has been able to grow at an average annual rate of around 2.5%.	在过去三十年中，美国能够以平均每年2.5%的速度增长。
Some attribute relatively slow growth to demographic factors, which have reduced the labor force, as well as to weak productivity levels, which have been low.	一些人将相对较慢的增长归因于人口因素，人口因素导致劳动力减少和已然低迷的生产率水平进一步恶化。
But America’s potential output may be underestimated, and its inflation propensity exaggerated.	但美国的潜在产出可能被低估，而通胀倾向被高估。
The US labor market works well.	美国劳动力市场运转良好。
Unemployment is down to 5%, with no signs of overheating.	失业率已下降至5 % ， 没有过热迹象。
The employment cost index suggests that wage increases so far have been surprisingly low.	就业成本指数表明目前工资增长低得出人意料。
One reason for this is that labor-market flexibility increased during the recovery.	这一现象的一个原因是复苏期间劳动力市场弹性有所增加。
Self-employment, short-term contracts, or part-time arrangements account for many of the jobs that have been created over the past few years.	自由职业、短期合同工和兼职占了过去几年工作岗位创造的很大一部分。
Full-time jobs with comprehensive benefits are now much rarer.	如今，福利俱全的全职工作少见多了。
This ongoing “Uberization” of the US labor market means that the balance in the wage-setting process has shifted.	美国劳动力市场的这一持续的“优步化 ” （ Uberization）意味着工资决定过程的平衡已经发生了改变。
As a result, it will take longer for demand to feed through to wages and inflation than in the past.	结果，需求反馈到工资和通胀所需要的时间比以前更长了。
Moreover, the economy is undergoing an ongoing technological shift stemming from digitization and globalization.	此外，美国经济正在经历数字化和全球化带来的持续的技术变迁。
Estimates from Citigroup indicate that almost half of all jobs will be disrupted in the coming decades.	花旗集团的估算表明，在未来几十年中，近一半的工作岗位将不复存在。
Jobs that require lower skills and less training are particularly vulnerable; but it is also clear that many other occupational categories – including administration, accounting, logistics, banking, and various service activities – are likely to be affected.	技能和训练要求低的岗位尤其脆弱；但同样明确的是，许多其他岗位类别 — — 包括管理、会计、物流、银行和各种服务活动 — — 也可能受到影响。
Companies will be able to reduce their headcount and production costs while improving customer service, which, like Uberization, will affect the wage-setting process.	公司可以在减少人手、降低生产成本的同时改进客户服务，这与优步化一样，也将影响工资决定过程。
Central bankers, I believe, are underestimating the impact of this structural shift.	我认为，央行行长低估了这一结构变迁的影响。
In the more tech-oriented economies, like the US, the United Kingdom, and the Nordic countries, there is a risk that traditional macroeconomic models will overestimate the cost pressure from labor.	在更加技术导向的经济体，如美国、英国和北欧国家，一个风险是传统宏观经济模型将高估来自劳动力的成本压力。
Another reason why the Fed should postpone a rate hike is that financial turmoil in emerging markets, particularly China, could have a substantial impact on the global economy, with some clear implications for the US economy.	美联储应该暂停升息的另一个原因是新兴市场（特别是中国）的金融动荡可能给全球经济造成重大冲击，美国经济也将受到明显影响。
In particular, lower energy and commodity prices are likely to dampen inflationary pressure.	特别是，能源和大宗商品价格下跌可能消除通胀压力。
When inflation is low for a long period, inflation expectations also tend to be low.	当通胀长期保持低迷时，通胀预期也会趋于下降。
Add falling commodity and energy prices to the mix and there is a risk that inflation expectations will remain too low to sustain a balanced recovery.	再加上大宗商品和能源价格下跌，就产生了一个风险，即，通胀压力太低而无法维持平衡复苏。
The global implications of lower emerging-market currencies are also likely to be deflationary.	新兴市场货币贬值的全球影响也可能是通缩性的。
The direct impact is that a stronger dollar reduces the cost of imported goods.	直接影响是强势美元增加进口品的成本。
The indirect effect, which might be substantial, is that cost-competitive light manufacturing in emerging markets increases.	间接影响可能更大，即成本竞争力强的新兴市场制造业的增长。
That would reinforce the deflationary pressure from globalization for years to come.	这将强化今后多年内来自全球化的通缩压力。
There is also a risk of greater currency-market volatility if the Fed jumps the gun in raising rates.	如果美联储抢先升息，还会带来货币市场波动扩大的风险。
The Fed’s unconventional monetary policies have been necessary for the US.	美联储的非常规货币政策对美国来说是必要的。
But, because they flooded global markets with liquidity, large portfolio flows have moved into emerging-market countries, whose currencies often are not as liquid as the dollar.	但是，这些政策给全球市场注入了流动性，巨大的投资组合流流向了新兴市场国家，而它们的货币流动性常常不如美国。
When investment moves back into dollars, the currency fluctuations in these less liquid markets can become excessive.	当投资流回美元时，这些流动性较差的市场的货币就会过度波动。
The Fed clearly has a responsibility to consider how its policy decisions affect the global financial system.	美联储有责任考虑其政策决定如何影响全球金融体系。
Excessive currency volatility is not in America’s interest, not least because large exchange-rate depreciations in emerging markets would amplify the effects of globalization on US jobs, wages, and inflation, particularly as weaker foreign currencies make outsourcing a more economically viable solution.	过度货币波动不符合美国的利益，因为新兴市场的大规模汇率贬值将放大全球化对美国就业、工资和通胀的影响，特别是当外币贬值使外包在经济上更加划算时。
Another reason for the Fed to reconsider hiking rates is that the legitimacy of the Bretton Woods institutions depends on a well-functioning global financial system.	美联储应该重新考虑是否升息的另一个理由是布雷顿森林机构的合法性依赖全球金融体系的正常运转。
The global economy’s center of gravity is moving to Asia, Latin America, and Africa, but the IMF and the World Bank still seem to mirror the reality of the 1950s.	全球经济的重心正在转向亚洲、拉丁美洲和非洲，但IMF和世界银行所体现的仍然是20实际50年代的现实。
If the Fed is seen as unleashing a major crisis in emerging markets, this will almost certainly do long-term damage to the global financial system.	如果美联储被认为是在制造一场新兴市场大危机，那么这几乎肯定会给全球金融体系造成长期伤害。
The Fed should regard lower commodity prices, reduced inflationary pressures, changes in the labor market, and further disruptive technological shifts as sufficiently convincing arguments to postpone a rate hike.	美联储应该将大宗商品价格的下跌、通胀压力的减小、劳动力市场的变化以及未来破坏性技术变迁视为暂停升息的压倒性证据。
Including the risk of excessive volatility in the global financial system tips the balance even further.	如果考虑到全球金融体系过度波动的风险，那么暂停升息的理由就更加充分了。
There is plenty of time for the Fed to signal that its policy stance has shifted, and the conclave in Jackson Hole is an excellent opportunity to start that communication.	美联储有充足的时间释放信号表明其政策立场的转变，而杰克森霍尔会议便是一次开始释放这一信号的良机。
If the facts have changed, the policy implications must also change.	如果事实发生了改变，政策也应该改变。
The greatest loss of credibility always comes when policymakers try to ignore changing realities.	信誉的最大损失永远来自决策者试图忽视变化的现实。
	
Why the Greek Bailout Failed	失败的希腊援助
CAMBRIDGE – As the Greek crisis evolves, it is important to understand that a successful structural-adjustment program requires strong country ownership.	美国剑桥—随着希腊危机的演进，一个很重要的要点是明白成功的结构调整方案需要强大的国家所有权（ownership ） 。
Even if negotiators overcome the most recent sticking points, it will be difficult to trust in their implementation if the Greek people remain unconvinced.	即使谈判者克服了最近的症结，如果说服不了希腊人民，也很难信任调整方案的实施。
That has certainly been the experience so far.	显然，目前的经验就是如此。
And without structural reform, there is little chance that the Greek economy will see sustained stability and growth – not least because official lenders are unwilling to continue extending an unreformed Greece significantly more money than it is asked to pay.	而如果没有结构改革，希腊经济就无从实现持续稳定和增长 — — 官方贷款人不愿给予不实施改革的希腊远远多于要求它偿还的资金。
(This has been the case through most of the crisis, even if one would never know it from the world press coverage.)	（大部分危机都是如此，尽管也许无法从全球媒体报道中了解这一点。 ）
Greece’s membership in the European Union gives its creditors significant leverage, but evidently not enough to change the fundamental calculus.	希腊的欧盟成员资格给了其债权人很大的杠杆（leverage ） ， 但显然仍不足以改变基本面。
Greece remains very much a sovereign country, not a sub-sovereign state.	希腊仍然是主权国家（country）而不是次主权的邦国（state ） 。
The “troika” of creditors – the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank, and the European Commission – simply do not enjoy the kind of leverage over Greece that, say, the Municipal Assistance Corporation wielded over New York City when it teetered on the edge of bankruptcy in the mid-1970s.	“三驾马车”债权人 — — IMF、欧洲央行和欧盟委员会 — — 在希腊问题上并没有获得类似于20世纪70年代市政援助公司（Municipal Assistance Corporation）在纽约市濒临破产时所获得的杠杆。
The best structural-adjustment programs are those in which the debtor country’s government proposes the policy changes, and the IMF helps design a bespoke program and provides the political cover for its implementation.	最好的结构调整计划应该让债务国政府实施政策变化，并由IMF帮助设计定制方案和提供实施方案的政治掩护。
Imposing them from the outside is simply not an effective option.	从外部实施这些政策绝非有效方法。
So, for reforms to take hold, the Greek government and its electorate must believe in them.	因此，要想巩固改革，希腊政府及其选民必须相信改革政策。
That a country must take ownership of its reform program is not a new lesson.	一国必须拥有其改革方案的所有权（ownership ） ， 这并非新教训。
The IMF’s rocky relationship with Ukraine began long before the latest round of negotiations.	IMF与乌克兰关系不稳定在最近一轮谈判之前很久就开始了。
Back in 2013, IMF staff wrote a sobering report on the organization’s experience in the country.	2013年，IMF工作人员撰写了一份发人深省的报告，总结了IMF在乌克兰的经验。
Their conclusion, in essence, was that the government’s failure to embrace the reform process fully all but guaranteed that its program would not work.	从根本上说，他们的结论是政府不充分相信改革程序，改革方案就无从奏效。
If a government is incapable of or uninterested in making the needed adjustments, the report argued, the best option is to drip money out as reforms are implemented, as is now being done in Greece.	报告认为，如果政府无力执行需要的调整或对调整不感兴趣，那么最佳办法是不实施改革就不给钱，就像现在对希腊做得那样。
Unfortunately, that approach has not proved adequate to overcome the challenges there.	不幸的是，这一方针不足以克服希腊的问题。
Structural-reform conditions often tilt the balance between competing domestic factions, for better or for worse.	结构改革的条件常常会改变互相竞争的国内派系，结果有利有弊。
If there is no will inside the country to maintain the reforms, they will quickly be undermined.	如果国内没有意愿维持改革，那么改革很快就会遭到破坏。
Left-wing ideologues have long viewed structural-reform programs with deep suspicion, accusing international lenders like the IMF and the World Bank of being captured by neoliberal market fundamentalists.	左翼思想一直认为结构改革方案十分可疑，IMF和世界银行的国际贷款人被新自由派市场原教旨主义绑架了。
This critique has some truth in it, but is overblown.	这一批评不无道理，但用力过猛。
To be sure, structural reforms often favor policies like labor-market flexibility.	诚然，结构改革常常向弹性劳动力市场等等政策倾斜。
But one should not make the mistake of viewing these interventions in black-and-white terms.	但不应该非黑即白地看待这些干预。
Breaking down dual labor markets that are excluding young workers (as they do in much of southern Europe, including Italy and, to some extent, France) is very different from making it easier to fire all workers.	打破将年轻工人排除在外的二���劳动力市场（南欧有很多这样的情况，包括意大利和一定程度上的法国）与让解雇一切工人变得更容易是完全不同的两码事。
Making pension systems sustainable does not amount to making them stingier.	让退休金体系变得可持续并不意味着一定要减少退休金。
Making tax systems simpler and fairer is not the same as raising all taxes.	简化和公平化税收体系并不等同于提高一切税收。
Recently, opponents of structural reform have put forward more exotic objections – most notably the problem caused by deflation when policy interest rates are at zero.	最近，结构改革的反对者提出了更加奇怪的反对理由 — — 最值得关注的是政策利率处于零水平时通缩所造成的问题。
If structural reforms simply lower all wages and prices, it may indeed be difficult in the short-term to counter the drop in aggregate demand.	如果结构改革降低了所有工资和物价，那么克服短期总需求下降的确十分困难。
But a similar critique could be made of any other change in policy: if it is poorly designed, it will be counter-productive.	但类似的批评也适用于其他任何政策变化：如果设计不合理，必然不利于生产。
The truth is that the way forward in Europe requires achieving greater productivity.	真相是欧洲要向前进就必须提高生产率。
The lessons from Greece and other unsuccessful bailout programs are sobering.	希腊和其他失败援助方案的教训发人深省。
If a debt bailout program requires a wholesale change in a country’s economic, social, and political model, the best course of action might be to write off the private losses, rather than pour in public money to cover them.	如果债务援助方案要求一国经济、社会和政治模式发生全面的变化，那么最好的行动方案可能是减记私人损失，而不是用公共资金覆盖私人损失。
In cases like Greece, the creditors’ passion for structural reforms might be better directed at home – particularly toward improving financial regulation.	在希腊的例子中，债权人的结构改革热情也许更应该引导向国内 — — 特别是改善金融监管。
The vast majority of Greeks want to stay in the EU.	绝大多数希腊人都希望留在欧盟。
In an ideal world, offering financial aid in exchange for reforms might help those in the country who want to shape it into a modern European state.	在理想情形中，以改革为交换提供金融援助也许有助于那些希望转变为现代欧洲邦国的国家。
But given the difficulty Greece has had so far in making the necessary changes to reach that goal, it might be time to reconsider this approach to the crisis completely.	但考虑到希腊目前在做出必要改变从而实现这一目标方面所遇到的困难，也许应该彻底重新思考这一危机解决方案。
In place of a program providing the country with further loans, it might make more sense to provide outright humanitarian aid – regardless of whether Greece remains fully within the eurozone.	对于向一国提供更多贷款的方案，也许最好的办法是提供直接人道援助 — — 不管希腊是否完全留在欧元区。
	
Why the Greek Deal Will Work	为何希腊协议会起作用
LONDON – Now that Greek banks have reopened and the government has made scheduled payments to the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, does Greece’s near-death experience mark the end of the euro crisis?	伦敦—希腊银行已经重新开门，希腊政府也按期偿付了欧洲央行和国际货币基金组织（IMF ） 。 那么，希腊差点死去的经验是否标志着欧元危机的结束？
The conventional answer is a clear no.	传统答案是言简意赅的“不 ” 。
According to most economists and political commentators, the latest Greek bailout was little more than an analgesic.	根据大部分经济学家和政治评论家的观点，最新一轮希腊援助充其量只是止痛剂。
It will dull the pain for a short period, but the euro’s deep-seated problems will metastasize, with a dismal prognosis for the single currency and perhaps even the European Union as a whole.	它能够暂时减少痛苦，但欧元的深层次问题将会转移，这个单一货币乃至整个欧盟的预后非常不乐观。
But the conventional wisdom is likely to be proved wrong.	但传统智慧可能是错误的。
The deal between Greece and the European authorities is actually a good one for both sides.	希腊和欧洲当局的协议实际上对于双方都是好事。
Rather than marking the beginning of a new phase of the euro crisis, the agreement may be remembered as the culmination of a long series of political compromises that, by correcting some of the euro’s worst design flaws, created the conditions for a European economic recovery.	该协议绝非欧元危机新阶段开始的标志，它有可能作为一系列漫长的政治妥协的起点被人铭记，这一系列妥协纠正了欧元最糟糕的设计缺陷，为欧洲经济复苏创造了条件。
To express guarded optimism about the Greek deal is not to condone the provocative arrogance of former Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis or the pointless vindictiveness of German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble.	表示对希腊协议谨慎乐观并不是要饶恕前希腊财政部长瓦鲁法基斯（Yanis Varoufakis）目中无人的傲慢或德国总理朔伊布勒（Wolfgang Schäuble）毫无意义的恶意相逼。
Neither is it to deny the economic criticism of the bailout provisions presented by progressives like Joseph Stiglitz and conservatives like Hans-Werner Sinn.	这也不是要否认斯蒂格利茨（Joseph Stiglitz）等进步人士和辛恩（Hans-Werner Sinn）等保守人士对援助条款的经济学批评。
The arguments against creating a European single currency and then allowing Greece to cheat its way into membership were valid back in the 1990s – and, in theory, they still are.	反对创造欧洲单一货币然后允许希腊作弊获得欧元区成员资格的批评可以在20世纪90年代很有道理 — — 理论上，它们至今仍然如此。
But this does not mean that breaking up the euro would be desirable, or even tolerable.	但这并不意味着应该让欧元区解体，甚至不意味着可以容忍欧元区解体。
Joining the euro was certainly ruinous for Greece, but there is always “a great deal of ruin in a nation,” as Adam Smith remarked 250 years ago, when losing the American colonies seemed to threaten Britain with financial devastation.	加入欧元区显然给希腊造成了破坏，但亚当·斯密在250年前失去美国殖民地眼看着要给英国带来金融灾难时就指出 ， “ 一个国家永远有各种破坏 ” 。
The great virtue of capitalism is that it adapts to ruinous conditions and even finds ways of turning them to advantage.	资本主义的一大优点是它能适应破坏性条件甚至找到办法把它们转化为优势。
The United States in the mid-nineteenth century was badly suited for a single currency and a single economic structure, as evidenced by the Civil War, which was provoked as much by single-currency tensions as by moral abhorrence to slavery.	十九世纪中叶的美国十分不适合采取单一货币和单一经济结构，南北战争就是明证，单一货币紧张局势和对奴隶制到的痛恨都是战争爆发的原因。
Italy would probably be better off today if Garibaldi had never launched unification.	如果加里波第没能统一意大利，说不定意大利会比今天更好。
But once unification has happened, the pain of dismantling the political and economic settlement usually overwhelms the apparent gains from a break-up.	但一旦统一事件发生了，废除政治和经济制度安排的痛苦常常会比分裂的直接好处更大。
This seems to be the case in Europe, as clear majorities of voters are saying in all eurozone countries, including Germany and Greece.	欧洲似乎就是如此，所有欧元区国家，包括德国和希腊的绝对多数选民都这么认为。
Thus, the question was never whether the single currency would break up, but what political reversals, economic sacrifices, and legal subterfuges would occur to hold it together.	因此，问题从来不是单一货币是否将打破，而是何种政治逆转、经济牺牲和法律借口能让单一货币得以维持。
The good news is that Europe now has some persuasive answers.	好消息是欧洲现在已经有了一些有说服力的答案。
Indeed, Europe has overcome what could be described as the “original sin” of the single-currency project: the Maastricht Treaty’s prohibition of “monetary financing” of government deficits by the ECB and the related ban on mutual support by national governments of one another’s debt burdens.	事实上，欧洲已经克服了可称之为单一货币工程“原罪”的东西：马斯特里赫特条约禁止欧洲央行给政府赤字“货币融资”以及对国家政府共同支持彼此债务负担的禁令。
In January, ECB President Mario Draghi effectively sidestepped both obstacles by launching a program of quantitative easing so enormous that it will finance the entire deficits of all eurozone governments (now including Greece) and mutualize a significant proportion of their outstanding bonds.	1月，欧洲央行行长德拉吉事实上绕过了这两个障碍，实施了量化宽松方案，其规模之大足以为所有欧元区政府（现在也包括希腊）的全部赤字提供融资，并将它们未偿还债务的大部分共同化。
Moreover, European governments have belatedly understood the most basic principle of public finance.	此外，欧洲政府终于认识到公共财政的最基本原则。
Government debts never have to be repaid, provided they can be extended in a cooperative manner or bought up with newly created money, issued by a credible central bank.	政府债务永远不必偿还，只要可以以合作的方式展期或用由可信央行发行的新创造的货币买断。
But for this to be possible, interest payments must always be made on time, and the sanctity of debt contracts must always take precedence over electoral promises regarding pensions, wages, and public spending.	但要让这一幕发生，必须按时支付利息，并且债务契约的神圣性永远高于关于退休金、工资和公共支出的选举承诺。
Now that Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’s government has been forced to acknowledge the unqualified priority of debt servicing, and can now benefit from unlimited monetary support from the ECB, Greece should have little problem supporting its debt burden, which is no heavier than Japan’s or Italy’s.	如今，希腊总理齐普拉斯政府被迫承认了支付债务利息才是至高无上的当务之急，因此可以获得来自欧洲央行的无限量货币支持，因此，希腊支持其并不比日本或意大利更沉重的债务负担应该没有什么问题。
Finally, Germany, Spain, Italy, and several northern European countries required, for domestic political reasons, a ritual humiliation of radical Greek politicians and voters who openly defied EU institutions and austerity demands.	最后，德国、西班牙、意大利和一些北欧国家出于国内政治原因要求对公开违抗欧盟机构和紧缩要求的希腊政客和选民给予形式羞辱（ritual humiliation ） 。
Having achieved this, EU leaders have no further reason to impose austerity on Greece or strictly enforce the terms of the latest bailout.	实现了这一目的，欧盟领导人就没有进一步的理由对希腊施加紧缩或严格执行最新援助的条件。
Instead, they have every incentive to demonstrate the success of their “tough love” policies by easing austerity to accelerate economic growth, not only in Greece but throughout the eurozone.	相反，他们有很大的激励通过放松紧缩以加速经济增长（不仅仅是希腊，而是整个欧元区）来证明“严���的爱”的成功。
This raises a key issue that the Tsipras government and many others misunderstood throughout the Greek crisis: the role of constructive hypocrisy in Europe’s political economy.	这就引出了一个齐普拉斯政府和其他人在整个希腊危机中误解的问题：假设性伪善在欧洲政治经济学中的作用。
Gaps between public statements and private intentions open up in all political systems, but these become huge in a complex multinational structure like the EU.	公开言论和私下意图之间的差异在所有政治制度中都存在，但像欧盟这样的复杂多边结构中特别巨大。
On paper, the Greek bailout will impose a fiscal tightening, thereby aggravating the country’s economic slump.	表面上，希腊援助将带来财政紧缩，从而加剧希腊经济衰退。
In practice, however, the budget targets will surely be allowed to slip, provided the government carries out its promises on privatization, labor markets, and pension reform.	但在实际中，预算目标必然有商量余地，只要政府兑现其在私有化、劳动力市场和退休金改革方面的承诺。
These structural reforms are much more important than fiscal targets, both in symbolic terms for the rest of Europe and for the Greek economy.	这些结构改革比财政目标重要得多，不管是对欧洲其他国家的象征意义还是对希腊经济而言。
Moreover, the extension of ECB monetary support to Greece will transform financial conditions: interest rates will plummet, banks will recapitalize, and private credit will gradually become available for the first time since 2010.	此外，延长欧洲央行对希腊的货币支持将转变金融环境：利率将下降，银行将资本重组，私人信用将逐渐可得（这是2010年以来没有发生过的事 ） 。
If budget targets were strictly enforced by bailout monitors, which seems unlikely, this improvement in conditions for private borrowers could easily compensate for any modest tightening of fiscal policy.	如果援助监督者严格执行预算目标 — — 这看起来不太可能 — — 这一私人借款人条件的改善轻而易举就能补偿任何财政政策的略微收紧。
In short, the main conditions now seem to be in place for a sustainable recovery in Greece.	简言之，目前希腊可持续复苏的主要条件看起来已经具备。
Conventional wisdom among economists and investors has a long record of failing to spot major turning points; so the near-universal belief today that Greece faces permanent depression is no reason to despair.	经济学家和投资者的传统智慧常常无法辨认重要转折点；因此，完全不必担心当下几乎人人都持有的观点：希腊面临持久萧条。
	
Money-Market Resistance	货币市场基金的抵抗
CAMBRIDGE – The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently rejected proposed rules aimed at making money-market funds safer in a financial crisis – a rejection that has caused consternation among observers and other regulators.	发自剑桥 — — 美国证券交易委员会最近否决了一系列旨在令货币市场基金在金融危机中更加安全的提案，令众多观察员和其他监管者大惊失色。
Given the risks that money market funds can pose to the global financial system, as shown by their destabilizing role in the 2008 financial crisis, it is not hard to see why they are worried.	而考虑到货币市场基金可能为全球金融系统带来的风险 — — 正如其在2008年所扮演的不稳定角色—自然也不难明白人们为何如此忧虑。
Money-market funds take excess cash from investors and use it to purchase short-term IOUs from businesses, banks, and other financial institutions.	货币市场基金从投资者处吸收多余的资金来从企业，银行和其他金融机构购买短期金融要求权（IOU ） 。
They mimic bank accounts by allowing investors to write checks and promise that their investment’s value will not fall.	他们通过允许投资者写支票来模仿银行账户，并承诺后者的投资价值不会下跌。
In 2012, American “prime” money-market funds, which buy bank and corporate debt, were worth nearly $1.5 trillion.	在2012年，购买银行和企业债券的美国“主要”货币市场基金规模达1.5万亿美元。
The money flowing through these funds went to many of the world’s largest banks, including not just the obvious US suspects (JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citi), but also major European and Japanese banks such as Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Bank of Tokyo, Sumitomo, Credit Suisse, and ING.	通过这些基金的资金流通往全球许多大型银行，不仅包括常说的那几个美国巨头（摩根大通，美洲银行和花旗银行 ） ， 还有英格兰银行、德意志银行、东京银行，住友银行，瑞士瑞信银行和荷兰ING银行等欧日大型银行。
These six international banks alone accounted for nearly 20% of the prime money-market funds’ value.	单单后面这六家国际银行就占了主要货币市场基金总市值的近20 % 。
Many readers know how money-market funds work: An investor buys a $1.00 share from the XYZ fund, which keeps each share’s value at a constant $1.00, allowing the investor to believe that the money – invested in a pool of safe, secure, but not always government-guaranteed assets – is on deposit.	许多读者知道货币市场基金如何运作：一个投资者从某基金买了价值1美元的份额，而基金则一直保持每个份额都值1美元，令投资者相信自己的钱 — — 投资在一揽子安全，可靠但不常有政府担保的资产上 — — 是存款。
Even if the asset pool declines in value, the fund’s managers keep the value of each share at $1.00 by rounding upward the fund’s real value.	即便这个资产组合的价值下跌，基金经理也会通过将基金实际价值凑整的方式来将每份价值维持在1美元。
If the fund’s losses are big enough that rounding off still leaves it short of a stable $1.00 value, the fund “breaks the buck.”	如果基金的损失使其即便凑整也无法维持稳定的1美元价值，基金就“跌破面值”了。
That happened when Lehman Brothers failed in September 2008.	这种情况在2008年9月雷曼兄弟破产时就出现了。
The Reserve Fund, a well-established money-market fund with too many unpaid IOUs from Lehman, could not keep its value steady. It broke the buck.	“储备基金”这家持有过多未支付雷曼兄弟金融要求权的老牌货币市场无法维持自身价值稳定，出现了跌破面值的状况。
All money-market funds then became suspect, and many investors fled – withdrawing one-third of a trillion dollars in a single week.	所以货币市场基金都因此遭到了质疑，许多投资者闻风撤资 — — 仅仅一个星期内就赎回了3000多亿美元。
Since much of the money-market funds’ assets are IOUs from the world’s biggest banks, the withdrawals weakened the already-shaky global banking system.	由于大多数货币市场基金的资产都是那些来自各大银行的金融要求权，赎回行动削弱了本已摇摇欲坠的全球银行系统。
The Federal Reserve, seeking to stem the growing panic and stabilize the American and international banking system, promptly guaranteed the value of all money-market funds.	为了遏制恐慌的蔓延并稳定美国和国际银行系统，美联储则迅速为所有货币市场资金的价值做了担保。
The proposals that the SEC rejected were aimed at making money-market funds more robust by requiring that each fund maintain capital reserves or let its value “float” – and not be rounded up – to reflect its true, underlying risk.	而美国证券交易委员会所否决的几个提案正是为了让货币市场基金更加稳固，要求每个基金保持资本储备或者任其“浮动 ” — —而不是凑整 — — 来体现真实和潜在的风险。
The proposal would also have required that money-market funds hold back a fraction of some redemptions, thereby making investors take some risk that funds might not have complete transactional liquidity if their investments weakened.	提案同时也要求货币市场基金拒绝某些赎回行动中的一部分交易，从而令投资者们承担更多的风险 — — 如果他们的投资受损的话基金或许不会有完全的交易流动性。
A majority of the commissioners turned down the proposals after substantial lobbying from the mutual-fund industry.	在共有基金行业的有力游说下，委员会的大多数委员否决了这些提案。
If money-market funds had to maintain capital reserves, industry representatives argued, yields to investors would decline and the industry’s profits would suffer.	那些行业的代理人认为，如果货币市场基金需要保持资本储本金的话，投资者的收益和行业的利润都将受损。
And, if retail investors saw their money-market funds’ values declining from the amount that they had invested, and if they knew that they could not get all of their money back immediately, the funds would become less attractive.	同时如果零售投资者发现原本投资的货币市场基金价值出现了下跌，如果他们知道自己无法迅速把自己的钱赎回来，那么这些基金的吸引力就会下降。
Investors might choose other places for their excess cash, like banks.	投资者会选择其他地方来配置自己的多余现金，比如银行。
Banks are obliged to hold reserves, maintain capital, and pay deposit insurance to ensure that they can honor their deposits.	银行有义务去持有储备金，维持资本，并支付储蓄保险以确保能为这些储蓄负责。
The mutual-fund industry, one can assume, feared that the SEC’s rules would induce customers to redirect much of their cash directly into banks.	因此可以推测，共同基金行业害怕证券交易委员会的监管规则会令消费者将大部分现金转入银行。
As a result of the SEC’s inaction, money-market funds will continue to operate outside the scope of bank-style rules on capital and reserves, even though investors treat them like bank accounts.	即便投资者依然将其当作银行账户般看待，但由于证券交易委员会的不做为，货币市场基金将继续在银行式的资本和储备规则之外运作。
Unlike banks, though, they do not pay the government to insure their investors.	跟银行不同的是，他们并不会像政府付钱来为投资者担保。
But the 2008 financial crisis showed that, when push comes to shove, the government will backstop money-market funds nonetheless.	但2008年的金融危机显示，当情况危急时，政府依然会为货币市场基金撑腰。
The rejected proposals are thus good policy: money-market funds should be made safer – via capital requirements and liquidity restrictions – because they already receive a de facto government guarantee.	因此被否决的提案都是些好政策：货币市场基金应该变得更加安全 — — 通过对资本的要求以及流动性限制 — — 因为他们已经获得了一个事实上的政府担保。
Their steady value makes them appear safer to investors than they are to the world’s financial system.	它们的稳定价值使它们看上去对投资者显得更安全 — — 对全球金融系统就难说了。
The SEC’s rejection of the proposed rules demonstrates the power of concerted lobbying – and that concentrated interests often trump diffuse benefits.	证券交易委员会的否决行动显示出协商一致的游说行动 — — 以及集中的利益往往会胜过分散的利益。
Typically, an interest group lobbies Congress, blandishing persuasive arguments, campaign contributions, and other support; often enough members – or enough key members – come to see the merit of the group’s point of view (or at least vote as if they do).	通常来说，一个利益集团游说国会，组织有说服力的论据，发起筹款以及其他支持；往往有足够的议员 — — 或者足够的核心议员 — — 会看到该集团观点的可取之处（���至少看似明白地投下一票 ） 。
Meanwhile, ordinary citizens do not notice unless the issue receives significant media attention.	与此同时，普通市民直到情况受到媒体极大关注时才注意到这些事情。
Often no one lobbies the other side of the issue.	往往也没有人去游说并陈述事情的另外一面。
One might think that banks would counter-balance the mutual-fund industry’s lobbying efforts, because the likely effect of forcing money-market funds to pay for more of their systemic costs would be to expand funds flowing directly to banks.	有人或许会认为银行会抵消共同基金行业的游说努力，因为迫使货币市场基金支付更多系统成本可能会扩大直接流入银行的资金流。
But inflows through money-market funds are not so bad for banks, which get the cash without having to set aside reserves or pay for deposit insurance.	但以货币市场基金形式流入的资金对于银行来说其实并不太坏，因为后者无须为这些现金进行资本储备或者支付存款保险。
Some banks may even prefer these flows to direct deposits.	一些银行甚至更喜欢这类现金流而非直接存款。
So the mutual-fund industry had the regulators all to itself.	因此共同基金行业令监管者完全倒向了他们这边。
Its lobbyists told the SEC commissioners that current rules already did everything possible to ensure safety; that retail investors want money-market funds’ steady value; that change would hurt all investors; and that the recent Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation disrupts regulators’ ability to bail out money-market funds next time.	其游说者告诉一众证券交易委员会委员说没有比当前法规在确保资金安全方面更完善的了；说零售投资者想要货币市场基金的稳定价值；说改革会伤害所有投资者；说最近通过的Dodd-Frank金融改革立法削弱了监管者下次援助货币市场基金的能力。
Other regulators were watching, as were academics and journalists – and some regulators may now feel compelled to take over the money-market safety rules from the SEC or push the SEC back into action.	和学者和记者一样，其他监管者都在旁观这一切 — — 有些监管者可能现在会觉得必须去从证券交易委员会处接管货币市场安全法规或者促使委员会有所作为。
With no one having a direct financial interest in the outcome pressing an alternative view, the SEC’s initial decision was as predictable as it was bad.	由于没有人在推动另一个观点方面拥有直接的金融利益，委员会最初的决定也就变得毫无悬念，正如我们知道这个决定必将很糟糕那样。
	
Transatlantic Free Trade?	跨大西洋自由贸易？
MADRID – This month, the United States National Intelligence Council released a sobering report entitled Global Trends 2030: Alternative Worlds.	马德里—本月，美国国家情报委员会公布了一份不容乐观的报告 ： 《 全球趋势2030：不一样的世界 》 （ Global Trends 2030: Alternative Worlds ） 。
Most important, according to the authors, if current trends continue, Asia could soon surpass North America and Europe in global power.	作者所指出的最重要的一点是，如果当前趋势继续下去，亚洲将很快超过北美和欧洲成为全球一极。
It will have a higher GDP, larger population, higher military spending, and more technological investment.	亚洲将拥有更高的GDP、更多的人口、更大的军事支出和更多的技术投资。
In this geopolitical context, Europe and the US need each other more than ever, making greater transatlantic cooperation crucial.	在这样的地缘政治环境下，欧洲和美国比从前更加需要彼此，跨大西洋合作比以前更加重要。
This seems to be the approach that inspired outgoing US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s recent speech at the Brookings Institution on US-European relations.	这似乎也是即将离任的美国国务卿希拉里·克林顿在布鲁克林研究所美欧关系演讲的主旨。
Given the shift in global power and the prospect of US energy self-sufficiency as domestic hydrocarbon output booms, America is trying to adapt its foreign policy to the new multi-polar international order.	全球实力正在发生变迁，美国也因国内碳氢化合物产量增加而走向能源自给，在这样的背景下，美国将调整外交政策，以适应新的多极国际秩序。
And, although Asia is now America’s strategic priority, Europe is still the partner with which Americans have the most in common.	此外，尽管亚洲现在是美国的战略重点，但欧洲仍是和美国最有共同语言的伙伴。
“I want to be clear,” Clinton noted. “Our reorientation toward Asia is not a withdrawal from Europe.”	“我要澄清 ， ” 克林顿指出 ， “ 我们的亚洲导向并不意味着从欧洲撤出 。 ”
The US, according to Clinton, hopes that Europe will follow suit, so that Asia is seen not only as a market, but also as a focus of common strategic action.	按克林顿的说法，美国希望欧洲可以紧随其后，这样一来亚洲将不再仅仅是一个市场，而同时也是共同战略行动的焦点。
But, beyond that, as the US and Europe seek to ensure their global roles, cooperation between them is more important than ever.	但是，除此之外，在美国和欧洲都在寻求确保全球地位时，它们之间的合作前所未有地重要。
So now is the time for a bold initiative: the launch of a US-European Union free-trade agreement.	因此，现在正是果断行动的良机：推出美欧联盟（US-European Union）自由贸易协定。
Clinton has already hinted at America’s readiness for this, mentioning the possibility of negotiating a complete agreement that would increase trade and stimulate growth on both sides of the Atlantic.	克林顿暗示美国已为此做好准备，提及了进行能够增进大西洋两岸贸易、刺激大西洋两岸经济的完整协定谈判。
The journalist David Ignatius even dared to give it a name in a recent article in The Washington Post: TAFTA (Transatlantic Free-Trade Agreement).	记者伊格内修斯（David Ignatius）甚至在《华盛顿邮报》的最新文章中给它起了个名字：TAFTA（跨大西洋自由贸易协定 ） 。
Edward Luce, writing in the Financial Times, preferred “Transatlantic Partnership.”	《金融时报》的卢斯（Edward Luce）则更喜欢“跨大西洋伙伴关系”这个名字。
The US and the EU (taken as a whole) are not only the world’s two largest economies and typically the largest commercial partners for other major economies; they also maintain the world’s largest bilateral trade relationship.	美国和欧盟（作为一个整体）不但是世界第一和第二大经济体、其他主要经济体通常的最大商业伙伴；它们还是世界规模最大的双边贸易的双方。
American investment in Europe is three times higher than it is in Asia.	美国在欧洲的投资比在亚洲高三倍。
European investment in the US is eight times larger than its investments in China and India combined.	欧洲在美国的投资比在中国和印度的总和还高八倍。
So transatlantic trade is crucial for both economies, particularly for job creation.	因此跨大西洋贸易对双方都很关键，特别是在就业创造方面。
Indeed, it is estimated that one-third of all bilateral US-EU trade consists of internal transfers by companies that operate in both markets.	事实上，据估计，美国-欧盟双边贸易总额的三分之一是在双方都有经营活动的公司的内部转移。
Although US and EU tariffs on each other’s marketed manufactured goods are already low (below 3%, on average), a free-trade agreement would be enormously beneficial in promoting further investment, thereby boosting economic growth and creating more jobs.	尽管美国和欧盟对彼此的制造品关税已经很低（平均不到3 % ） ，但自由贸易协定仍能大大有利于后续投资，从而提振经济增长、创造就业。
Such an agreement could include trade in goods, services, financial instruments, and agriculture, and would necessitate greater compatibility of European and American regulations and legal norms, implying substantial savings.	这样一个协定可以包括商品、服务、金融工具和农业方面的贸易，也将成为增加欧洲和美国监管和法律规范兼容性的必要条件，这意味着省下大笔资金。
Moreover, the effects of such an agreement would be felt far beyond the US and Europe.	此外，这样一个协定的影响范围将远超美国和欧洲。
For example, both have already signed free-trade treaties with various Latin American countries, implying the creation of a geographically enormous free-trade area, which should boost economic resilience in the face of global crisis.	比如，美国和欧洲均已和许多拉丁美洲国家签订了自由贸易条约，这意味着可以建立一个地理范围极广的自由贸易区，从而增强抵御全球危机的韧性。
Indeed, regional free-trade agreements are gaining momentum worldwide.	事实上，地区自由贸易协定正在全世界高歌猛进。
The Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade agreement spearheaded by the US, is set to be a game-changer in the Asia-Pacific region, with decisive advances this year putting it on course to be concluded in 2015.	美国牵头的自由贸易协定跨太平洋合作伙伴关系改变亚太地区的格局，该协定在今年取得了决定性进步，计划将于2015年完成。
Potential signatories include the US, Australia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, New Zealand, Chile, Peru, Brunei, Canada, Mexico, and perhaps Japan and South Korea.	潜在签署方包括美国、澳大���亚、马来西亚、越南、新加坡、新西兰、智利、秘鲁、文莱、加拿大、墨西哥，可能还有日本和韩国。
The result will be trade liberalization in an area that produces 40% of global GDP.	其结果将是一个站全球GDP份额40%的自由贸易区。
Isn’t it time to consider something similar for Europe and the US?	现在难道不是考虑在欧洲和美国之间实行类似安排的良机吗？
The EU, now confronting a wave of populism and Euro-skepticism, could revive its sense of purpose by committing itself to closer transatlantic cooperation and coordination on trade, to be carried out by the European Commission.	眼下，欧盟正面对着欧元怀疑派的民粹主义风潮，它可以通过更深地投入跨大西洋贸易合作和协作（将由欧盟委员会负责实施）重新燃起使命感。
Such a project has worked before in bringing Europe together; it can do so again.	类似的工程曾经在团结欧洲方面祈祷过重要作用；现在可以依样画葫芦。
The most precious asset today is confidence, and the mere fact of launching negotiations would generate it in abundance.	眼下，信心比黄金更重要，而进行谈判这一事实变已足够产生足够的信心。
Protectionism is no solution to the crisis, whereas a transatlantic free-trade agreement would favor multilateralism and openness.	保护主义绝不是危机的解决方案，而跨大西洋自由贸易协定有利于多边主义和开放。
In this sense, it is important to stress the work of the World Trade Organization, the best multilateral forum that the world has for resolving trade disputes.	从这个角度看，促进世贸组织的工作十分重要，因为这是世界所拥有的解决贸易纠纷的最好论坛。
Signing a transatlantic trade treaty would be irrefutable proof that the political case for open trade can be made – and won.	毫无疑问，签署跨大西洋贸易条约能够证明，开放贸易的政治条件可以创造并成功。
The only way to achieve this is through the clear commitment of political leaders on both sides of the Atlantic, together with private-sector involvement, which is fundamental to sustaining urgently needed economic growth.	达到这一目标的唯一办法是大西洋两岸政治领袖的明确承诺，并辅之以私人部门参与，后者是维持急需的经济增长的关键。
But let’s not wait: faced with predictions of the West’s relative decline, the US and the EU must commit themselves to more union, more cooperation, and more prosperity.	但所谓时不我待，在西方相对衰落的预言声中，美国和欧盟应该致力于更多的联合，更多的合作和更大的繁荣。
Today, that means a transatlantic free-trade agreement.	如今，这就意味着跨大西洋自由贸易协定。
	
Financial Reform’s Breakthrough Year	金融改革的突破之年
ZANZIBAR – Here’s an odd prediction for the coming year: 2013 will be a watershed for financial reform.	桑给巴尔—新一年有老预言：2013年将是金融改革的分水岭之年。
True, while the global financial crisis erupted more than four years ago, and the Dodd-Frank financial reforms were adopted in the United States back in 2010, not much has changed about how Wall Street operates – except that the large firms have become bigger and more powerful.	诚然，尽管全球金融危机爆发已逾四年，美国的多德-弗兰克金融改革也在2010年便被通过，但华尔街的运作方式并没有什么变化 — — 除了大公司变得更大、更有权势之外。
Yet there are reasons to expect real progress in the new year.	但仍有不少理由期待新的一年中会有真正的进步。
The US Federal Reserve is finally shifting its thinking.	美联储终于开始转变思维了。
In a series of major speeches this fall, Governor Dan Tarullo made the case that the problem of “too big to fail” financial institutions remains with us.	在今年秋天的一系列重要演讲中，美联储理事塔鲁罗（Dan Tarullo）明确指出，金融机构“太大而不能倒”的问题仍然没有消除。
We need to take additional measures to reduce the level of systemic risk – including limiting the size of our largest banks.	我们需要动用更多的措施降低系统性风险 — — 包括限制最大银行的规模。
News reports indicate that the Fed has already started saying no to some bank mergers.	新报告表明，美联储已经开始对一些银行并购说不。
At the same time, the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has become a bastion of sensible thinking on financial-sector issues.	与此同时，美国联邦存款保险公司（FDIC）已成为理智思考金融部门问题的重要堡垒。
In part, this is because the FDIC is responsible for cleaning up the mess when financial-sector firms fail, so its senior officials have a strong incentive to protect its insurance fund by preventing risks from getting out of control.	这部分是因为FDIC需要在金融部门企业倒闭时收拾残局，因此其高级官员有强烈的激励通过防止风险失控保护保险资金。
The FDIC is showing intellectual leadership as well as organizational capabilities – Vice Chairman Tom Hoenig’s speeches are a must-read.	FDIC不但起到了观念领袖作用，也是组织能力的先锋 — — 其副主席霍尼格（Tom Hoenig）的演讲不容错过。
Wall Street is pushing back, of course.	当然，华尔街在卷土重来。
But the rolling series of scandals surrounding global megabanks makes it difficult for anyone to keep a straight face when executives insist that our largest banks must maintain their current scale and scope.	但全球银行巨头没完没了的丑闻让所有人都不会对银行高管所声称的大银行必须维持现有规模的论调买账。
Do we need HSBC to facilitate global money laundering?	我们需要汇丰帮助在全世界洗钱吗？
Do we need Barclays and UBS to manipulate Libor (a key benchmark for interest rates around the world)?	我们希望巴克莱和瑞银操纵Libor（世界关键性基准利率之一）吗？
Do we need still more losses at poorly run trading operations for JP Morgan Chase?	我们需要JP摩根大通的不慎交易给我们带来更大损失吗？
The pro-bank lobby groups are positioning themselves to argue that the new resolution powers under Dodd-Frank have ended the too-big-to-fail problem, and we can expect a public-relations drive in this direction early in the new year.	支持银行的游说集团辩称新多德-弗兰克法案下的解决方案已经终结了太大而不能倒问题，明年年初，我们可以期待公共关系推动这一方向的进步。
But the consensus view at the most recent meeting of the FDIC’s Systemic Resolution Advisory Committee (of which I am a member) was that this claim should not be taken seriously.	但FDIC系统性解决方案咨询委员会（Systemic Resolution Advisory Committee，我也是委员之一）最新的一致意见是对这一论断不能妄加信任。
Under Dodd-Frank, it is arguably easier for the FDIC to handle the failure of a single large financial institution than it was in pre-Dodd-Frank days.	在多德-弗兰克法案下，FDIC处理一家大金融机构的难度确实比多德-弗兰克法案出台前容易了一些。
But what if two or three or seven firms are all in trouble at the same time?	但如果两家、三家甚至所有金融企业同时陷入麻烦呢？
The answer, as former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker implied at the meeting, is that we would be right back where we started – in the panic and frozen credit markets that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.	前美联储主席沃克尔在会议中指出，答案在于我们应该回到起点 — — 2008年9月雷曼兄弟倒闭所引起的恐慌和信用市场冻结。
Indeed, the idea that substantial shocks could soon hit the US financial system is not far-fetched.	事实上，严重冲击很快会袭向美国金融体系的观点绝非杞人忧天。
The European debt crisis, for example, remains far from being resolved.	比如，欧洲债务危机就远远没有得到解决。
A significant sovereign-debt restructuring there would bring down European banks and potentially damage US banks – as well as financial institutions around the world.	欧洲的大规模主权债务重组将导致欧洲银行的倒闭，并可能危害美国银行以及全世界的金融机构。
Meanwhile, the continuing problems at European banks are a stark reminder that operating highly leveraged, thinly capitalized firms is incredibly risky.	与此同时，欧洲银行问题的持续提醒我们，高杠杆、低资本经营的公司风险极高。
And the regulatory failures in Europe – consider the German Landesbanks, for example – will become only more obvious in the coming months.	而欧洲的监管无能 — — 德国Landesbanks就是明证 — — 在未来几个月中将进一步显现。
Creating a common supervisory authority will mean nothing unless it can clean up the mess created by the existing supervisors.	成立共同监督当局是毫无意义的，除非它能够收拾好现任监督者留下的残局。
And that cleanup will expose more of the rot in banks’ current operations.	而收拾残局将会把更多欧洲银行的经营问题暴露出来。
The need for banks to finance themselves with more equity and relatively less debt will be the focus of one of the main publishing events in economics in 2013.	银行需要更多地依靠股权融资、相对减少债务为自己筹集资金，这将使2013年经济读物的主要关注点之一。
Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig’s The Bankers’ New Clothes: What’s Wrong with Banking and What to Do About it? will appear officially in March, but advance copies are already being closely read in leading central banks.	阿德马蒂（Anat Admati）和赫尔维格（Martin Hellwig）的《银行家的新衣：银行犯了什么错以及怎样纠正错误？ 》 （ The Bankers’ New Clothes: What’s Wrong with Banking and What to Do About it ? ） 将在3月正式面世，但抢鲜版已经开始在主要央行中间流传。
Bankers everywhere will rush to read it before their regulators do.	各国银行家都会抢在监管者之前阅读这本书。
The road to the ongoing financial and economic crisis was built on a foundation of intellectual capture: not only regulators, but academics, too, became captivated by modern finance and its methods.	迈向持续金融和经济之路建立在思想禁锢的基础上：不仅仅是监管者，学术界也越来越受制于现代金融学及其方法的支配。
Admati and Hellwig are at the vanguard of the counterrevolution, challenging the great myths of banking head-on.	阿德马蒂和赫尔维格是反革命先锋，挑战了“银行向前冲”的大神话。
Do we need financial institutions to be so highly leveraged (that is, carrying so much debt relative to equity)?	我们需要金融机构杠杆如此职高吗（也就是说，相对于股本债务太多 ） ？
No, they argue.	他们的回答是否定的。
If banks of all kinds were financed with more equity, they would have stronger buffers to absorb losses.	如果各种各样的银行都更多地通过股权方式融资，它们将拥有更大的损失吸收缓冲。
Both the equity and the debt issued by well-capitalized banks would be safer – and therefore cheaper.	资本状况较好的银行所发行的股票和债券将更安全 — — 因此成本更低。
Bankers want to be so highly leveraged for a simple reason: implicit government guarantees mean that they get the upside when things go well, while the downside is someone else’s problem.	银行家希望杠杆率如此之高，原因很简单：隐性政府担保意味着他们可以在好光景时获利，而坏光景是其他人的问题。
Contrary to bankers’ claims, this is not a good arrangement for society.	与银行家的言论相反，这绝不是好的社会安排。
Admati and Hellwig are confronting the bankers and their allies in no uncertain terms, grounding their argument in deep financial thinking, yet writing for a broad audience.	阿德马蒂和赫尔维格以斩钉截铁的方式站在了银行界及其盟军的对立面，他们的论点具有深层金融思想根基，尽管他们的书是写给大众看的。
Whatever else happens in 2013, we can be sure that they will not win the Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year award.	不论2013年发生什么事情，我们可以确定的是，这本书得不到高盛年度商业书籍奖。
	
In Defense of Non-Visionaries	为非空想主义者辩护
OXFORD – Many of the recent tributes for Margaret Thatcher following her death celebrated her as a “transformational” leader who brought about great changes.	牛津—玛格丽特·撒切尔去世后，很多最新纪念文章称赞她是带来伟大变革的“转型”领袖。
There were frequent references to her equally transformational American counterpart, Ronald Reagan.	经常被提到的还有她的美国转型同侪罗纳德·里根。
But a more interesting comparison is with her other presidential contemporary, George H. W. Bush.	但更有趣的比较是把她和另一位美国总统放在一起 — — 老布什。
Though often dismissed as a mere “transactional” manager, Bush had one of the best foreign-policy records of the past half-century.	尽管通常被贬低为“事务性”管理者，老布什却拥有着过去半个世纪的最佳外交政策记录。
His administration managed the end of the Cold War, the dismantlement of the Soviet Union, and the unification of Germany within NATO – all without violence.	他的政府让冷战结束，目睹了苏联的解体，让德国在北约框架内实现了重新统一 — — 所有这些都没有使用暴力。
At the same time, he led a broad United Nations-backed coalition that repelled Saddam Hussein’s aggression against Kuwait.	与此同时，他领导了广泛的由联合国支持的联盟，击退了萨达姆·侯赛因对科威特的入侵。
Had he dropped any of the balls he was juggling, today’s world would be much worse.	他在任何一个方面稍有闪失，当今世界就会糟糕得多。
Although he presided over a major global transformation, Bush, by his own account, did not have transformational objectives.	尽管他主导了重要的全球转型，但就个人而言，老布什并没有转型目标。
On the unification of Germany, he resisted the advice of Thatcher and others, apparently out of a sense of fairness and responsiveness to his friend, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.	在德国重新统一的问题上，它坚持撒切尔和其他人的意见，显然偏向于他的朋友、德国总理科尔而不顾公平。
In October 1989, Bush responded to a call from Kohl by publicly stating that he did not “share the concern that some European countries have about a reunified Germany.”	1989年10月，老布什响应科尔的呼吁，公开声称他不“同意一些欧洲国家对重新统一的德国的担心 ” 。
At the same time, he was careful to let Kohl and others take the lead.	与此同时，他小心翼翼地让科尔和其他人主导形势发展。
When the Berlin Wall was opened a month later, partly owing to an East German mistake, Bush was criticized for his low-key response.	当一个月后柏林墙倒掉时（部分是因为东德的错误 ） ， 老布什因其反应太过低调而受到批评。
But Bush had made a deliberate choice not to humiliate the Soviets or gloat: “I won’t beat on my chest and dance on the wall,” was his response – a model of emotional intelligence in a leader.	但老布什深思熟虑地选择不去羞辱苏联，也不幸灾乐祸 ： “ 我不会在柏林墙上手舞足蹈 ， ” 这就是他的反应 — — 堪称领袖心理智慧的样板。
Such self-restraint helped to set the stage for the successful Malta Summit with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev a month later.	如此自我克制帮助他成功地在一个月后于苏联总统戈尔巴乔夫举行了马耳他峰会。
The Cold War ended quietly, and the dismantlement of the Soviet empire followed.	冷战静悄悄地结束了，随之而来的苏联帝国的倒闭。
As Bush and his team responded to forces that were largely outside of his control, he set goals and objectives that balanced opportunities and constraints in a prudent manner.	当老布什及其团队应对他所无法控制的力量时，他审慎地权衡机会和约束，设定目标和目的。
Some critics have faulted him for not supporting the national aspirations of Soviet republics like Ukraine in 1991 (when he delivered his infamous “Chicken Kiev” speech warning against “suicidal nationalism”); for failing to go to Baghdad to unseat Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War; or for sending Brent Scowcroft to Beijing to maintain relations with China after the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989.	一些批评家挑他的刺，认为他不支持苏联加盟��和国的民族意愿（比如1991年的乌克兰，他做了臭名昭著的《基辅鸡 》 （ Chicken Kiev）演讲，警告“自杀式民族主义 ” ） 、批评他没能在海湾战争中进军巴格达把萨达姆赶下台、指责他在1989年天安门事件后派布伦特·斯考克罗夫特（Brent Scowcroft）前往北京维持与中国的关系。
But, in each instance, Bush was limiting his short-term gains in order to pursue long-term stability.	但是，在所有这些事件中，老布什都为了长期稳定而牺牲短期利益。
Other critics complained that Bush did not set more transformational objectives regarding Russian democracy, the Middle East, or nuclear non-proliferation at a time when world politics seemed fluid.	也有批评家认为老布什没有在俄罗斯民主、中东和核不扩散问题上追求更有转型意义的目标 — — 当时的世界政坛波诡云谲。
But, again, Bush remained more focused on maintaining global stability than on advancing new visions.	但是，老布什扔更关注维持全球稳定而不是推行新愿景。
Bush was also respectful of institutions and norms at home and abroad, going to the US Congress for authorization of the Gulf War, and to the United Nations for a resolution under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter.	老布什还尊重国内外制度和范式，要求美国国会授权参与海湾战争，要求联合国根据联合国宪章第七条给出决议。
Although a realist in his thinking, he could be Wilsonian in his tactics.	尽管他的思维是现实主义的，但在策略上，他是威尔逊主义的。
Bush’s termination of the ground war in Iraq after only four days was motivated in part by humanitarian concerns about the slaughter of Iraqi troops, as well as by an interest in not leaving Iraq so weakened that it could not balance the power of neighboring Iran.	老布什在结束伊拉克地面战争开始仅仅四天后就鸣金，部分原因是出于伊拉克军队遭屠的人道主义考虑，也有部分是出于不能让伊拉克过于孱弱以至于无法制衡相邻的伊朗的利益计算。
While Bush’s invasion of Panama to capture (and later put on trial) Manuel Noriega may have violated Panamanian sovereignty, it had a degree of de facto legitimacy, given Noriega’s notorious behavior.	老布什的入侵巴拿马并俘获（随后审判）曼努尔·诺列加（Manuel Noriega）也许破坏了巴拿马的主权，但这具有一定程度的实际合法性，因为诺列加是臭名昭著的暴君。
And, when Bush organized his international coalition to prosecute the Gulf War, he included several Arab countries – not to ensure military success, but to boost the mission’s legitimacy.	而当老布什组织多国联合控诉海湾战争时，他把一些阿拉伯国家也包括了进来 — — 这不是为了确保军事胜利，而是为了增加行动的合法性。
When Bush and Thatcher met in Aspen, Colorado, in the summer of 1990, Thatcher allegedly warned him “not to go wobbly.”	1990年夏，老布什和撒切尔在科罗拉多州阿斯彭（Aspen）举行会晤，据说撒切尔警告他“不要摇摆不定 ” 。
But most historians agree there was no such danger.	但大部分历史学家同意根本不存在这样的危险。
With his careful combination of hard and soft power, Bush created a successful strategy – one that accomplished American goals in a manner that was not unduly insular and with minimal damage to the interests of foreigners.	老布什小心翼翼地结合了硬实力和软实力，创造了成功的战略，以既不过于狭隘、又能将他国利益损害最小化的方式实现美国的目标。
He was careful not to humiliate Gorbachev, and to manage the transition to Boris Yeltsin’s presidency in a newly independent Russia.	他小心地不去羞辱戈尔巴乔夫，并完成了新成立的独立的俄罗斯向叶利钦做总统的过渡。
Of course, not all foreigners were adequately protected.	当然，并非所有外国人都得到了充分保护。
For example, Bush assigned a low priority to Kurds and Shia in Iraq, to dissidents in China, and to Bosnians in the former Yugoslavia.	比如，老布什对伊拉克库尔德人和什叶派、中国持异见者和前南斯拉夫的波斯尼亚人就不那么上心。
In that sense, Bush’s realism set limits to his cosmopolitanism.	从这个角度来说，老布什的现实主义限制了他的世界大同观。
Could Bush have done more had he been a transformational leader like Thatcher or Reagan?	如果老布什是像撒切尔和里根那样的转型领袖，他能做得更多吗？
Perhaps he might have done more in a second term.	也许他可以在第二个任期做得更多。
And, with better communication skills, he might have been able to do more to educate the American public about the changing nature of the post-Cold War world.	而如果沟通技巧更好，他或许能更好地教育美国公众明白后冷战世界的变化本质。
But, given the profound uncertainty of a world in flux, as well as the dangers of miscalculation as the Soviet empire collapsed, prudent management trumped grand visions.	但是，在流动世界的高度不确定性中，在错误估计苏联帝国解体的风险阴影笼罩下，审慎管理要胜于宏伟空想。
Bush famously said that he did not do “the vision thing.”	老布什有句名言，他不“做空想的事 ” 。
Nonetheless, few people at the end of 1989 believed that Germany could be reunited peacefully within the Western alliance.	尽管如此，在1989年底，很少有人相信德国灰和平地重新统一并留在西方同盟中。
Thatcher certainly did not.	撒切尔显然不相信。
The lesson is that in some circumstances, we should prefer leadership by good transactional managers like George H. W. Bush (or Dwight Eisenhower before him), rather than by more flashy and inspirational transformers.	这表明，在某些环境中，我们应该看好作为优秀事务性管理者的领导人，比如老布什（以及他之前的艾森豪威尔 ） ， 而不是更犀利、更能激发人心的转型领导人。
	
Should Business Travel Be Obsolete?	商务旅行应该淘汰吗？
COLOMBO – Think about it: You can call, email, and even watch your counterparty on FaceTime, Skype, or GoToMeeting.	科伦坡—想一想：你可以在FaceTime、Skype或GoToMeeting上呼叫你的对手方、给他们发电邮，甚至与与他们面对面。
So why do companies fork out more than $1.2 trillion a year – a full 1.5% of the world’s GDP – for international business travel?	既然如此，为何公司每年还要花1.2万亿美元以上的钱 — — 足足相当于世界GDP的1.5 % — —用于国际商务旅行？
The expense is not only huge; it is also growing – at 6.5% per year, almost twice the rate of global economic growth and almost as fast as information and telecommunication services.	开支不但巨大，而且还在增长 — — 每年6.5 % ， 几乎是全球经济增长的两倍，或者与信息和通讯服务业增长相当。
Computing power has moved from our laptops and cellphones to the cloud, and we are all better off for it.	计算能力已经从笔记本和手机移动到云端，这让我们所有人都从中获益。
So why do we need to move brains instead of letting those brains stay put and just sending them bytes?	那么，为何我们还需要移动大脑，而不是让这些大脑留在原地，而只是传输大脑中的数据？
Why waste precious work time in the air, at security checks, and waiting for our luggage?	为何要把宝贵的工作时间浪费在空中、安检门和等待行李上？
Before anyone starts slashing travel budgets, let’s try to understand why we need to move people rather than information.	在开始削减差旅预算前，让我们试着理解一下为何我们需要让人移动，而不是信息。
Thanks to a research collaboration on inclusive growth with MasterCard and an anonymized donation of data to the Center for International Development at Harvard University, we are starting to shed some light on this mystery.	通过与万事达卡的联合包容增长研究，以及向哈佛大学国际发展中心的匿名数据捐赠，我们开始探索这一谜题并取得了一些洞见。
In ongoing work with Dany Bahar, Michele Coscia, and Frank Neffke, we have been able to establish some interesting stylized facts.	在与丹尼·巴哈尔（Dany Bahar ） 、 米歇尔·柯西亚（Michele Coscia）和弗兰克·尼福柯（Franke Neffke）的研究中，我们已经能够识别出一些有趣的典型事实。
More populous countries have more business travel in both directions, but the volume is less than proportional to their population: a country with 100% more population than another has only about 70% more business travel.	人口较多的国家双向商务旅行也更多，但旅行量的增量不及人口比例：如果一个国家人口比另一个国家多100 % ， 其商务旅行量将只多出70%左右。
This suggests that there are economies of scale in running businesses that favor large countries.	这表明营商存在有利于大国的规模经济。
By contrast, a country with a per capita income that is 100% higher than another receives 130% more business travelers and sends 170% more people abroad.	相反，如果一国人均收入比另一国高100 % ， 那么它所接收的商务旅行者将多出130 % ， 它发出的商务旅行者将多出170 % 。
This means that business travel tends to grow more than proportionally with the level of development.	这意味着商务旅行增长比例要高于发展水平。
While businesspeople travel in order to trade or invest, more than half of international business travel seems to be related to the management of foreign subsidiaries.	商务人士旅行的目的是做交易或投资，但超过一半的国际商务旅行与外国分支管理层有关。
The global economy is increasingly characterized by global firms, which need to deploy their know-how to their different locations around the world.	全球经济中的全球企业越来越多，它们需要在全世界各地部署专业知识。
The data show that there is almost twice the amount of travel from headquarters to subsidiaries as there is in the opposite direction.	数据表明，从总部到分支的旅行量是相反方向的近两倍。
Exporters also travel twice as much as importers.	出口国旅行量是进口国的两倍。
But why do we need to move the brain, not just the bytes?	但为什么我们需要移动大脑，而不仅仅是数据？
I can think of at least two reasons.	我可以想到至少两个原因。
First, the brain has a capacity to absorb information, identify patterns, and solve problems without us being aware of how it does it.	首先，大脑具有吸收信息、识别模式和解决问题的模式，我们根本不需要知道大脑如何做到这一点。
That is why we can, for example, infer other people’s goals and intentions from facial expressions, body language, intonation, and other subtle indicators that we gather unconsciously.	因此，我们能够（比如）在面部表情、肢体语言、语调和其他我们下意识收集到的微妙信号中推断他人的目标和意图。
When we attend a meeting in person, we can listen to the body language, not just the spoken word, and we can choose where to look, not just the particular angle that the video screen shows.	当我们召开现场会议时，我们可以倾听肢体语言，而不仅仅是说出来的话，我们可以选择看哪里，而不仅仅是通过视频中的特殊角度。
As a consequence, we are better able to evaluate, empathize, and bond in person than we can with today’s telecom technologies.	因此，我们能够比通过当今通讯技术更好地评估他人、产生共鸣、建立纽带。
Second, the brain is designed to work in parallel with other brains.	其次，大脑天生具有与其他大脑并行工作的能力。
Many problem-solving tasks require parallel computing with brains that possess different software and information but that can coordinate their thoughts.	许多解决问题的任务需要与拥有不同软件和信息，但能够协调思想的其他大脑进行并行计算。
That is why we have design teams, advisory boards, inter-agency taskforces, and other forms of group interaction.	因此我们有了设计团队、顾问委员会、跨部门任务小组和其他形式的集体互动。
Conference calls try to match this interaction, but it is hard to speak in turn or to see one another’s expressions when someone is talking.	电话会议试图取代这一互动，但在电话会议中很难依次发言或在某人正在发言时 观察彼此的表情。
Conference calls have trouble replicating the intricacy of human conscious and unconscious group interactions that are critical to solve problems and accomplish tasks.	电话会议无法复制人的意识和无意识集体互动的复杂性，而这种复杂性是解决问题、完成任务的关键。
The amount of travel should then be related to the amount of know-how that needs to be moved around.	因此，旅行量应该与有多少知识需要移动有关。
Countries differ in the amount of know-how they possess, and industries differ in the amount of know-how they require.	各国拥有的知识量不同，各行业所需要的知识量也不同。
Controlling for population and per capita income, travel is significantly more intense to and from countries and industries that possess or use more know-how.	控制人口和人均收入变量，拥有或使用更多知识的国家和行业，商务旅行的密集程度显著更高。
The countries that account for the most travel abroad, controlling for population, are all in Western Europe: Germany, Denmark, Belgium, Norway, and the Netherlands.	出国旅行量最大的国家（控制人口因素后）都在西欧：德国、丹麦、比利时、挪威和荷兰。
Outside of Europe, the most travel-intensive countries are Canada, Israel, Singapore, and the United States, a reflection of the fact that they need to deploy many brains to make use of their diverse know-how.	在欧洲之外，旅行最密集的国家为加拿大、以色列、新加坡和美国，这反映了一个事实：它们需要部署许多大脑来让它们多样化的知识派上用场。
Interestingly, countries in the developing world differ substantially in the amount of know-how they receive through business travel.	有趣的是，发展中国家通过商务旅行所获得的知识量大相径庭。
For example, countries such as South Africa, Bulgaria, Morocco, and Mauritius receive much more know-how than countries at similar levels of development such as Peru, Colombia, Chile, Indonesia, or Sri Lanka.	比如，南非、保加利亚、摩洛哥和毛里求斯等国家所获得知识量远远多于发展水平相当的秘鲁、哥伦比亚、智利、印度尼西亚或斯里兰卡。
The fact that firms incur the cost of business travel suggests that, for some key tasks, it is easier to move brains than it is to move the relevant information to the brains.	企业愿意承担商务旅行的成本，这一事实表明，对于一些关键性任务，移动大脑要比将相关信息传递给大脑更加容易。
Moreover, the fact that business travel is growing faster than the global economy suggests that output is becoming more intensive in know-how and that know-how is diffusing through brain mobility.	此外，商务旅行比全球经济增长更快这一事实表明，产出的知识密集程度日益增加，而知识通过大脑的移动扩散。
And, finally, the huge diversity of business travel intensity suggests that some countries are deploying or demanding much more know-how than others.	最后，商务旅行密集程度的巨大差异表明一些国家比其他国家部署或需求更多的知识。
Rather than celebrate their thrift, countries that are out of the business travel loop should be worried.	位于商务旅行环路之外的国家不应该因为节俭而自豪，而应该感到担忧。
They may be missing out on more than frequent flyer miles.	它们也许已经被更加频繁地飞来飞去的国家远远甩在了身后。
	
Why Tuberculosis Persists	结核病为什么无法根除
SAN FRANCISCO – It surprises many people in Europe and North America that tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the great scourges in human history.	旧金山 — — 欧洲和北美许多人惊讶地看到结核病仍然是人类历史上最严重的灾难之一。
One out of every three people in the world is infected with latent or sub-clinical TB, and scientists predict that 10% of them will manifest the disease as age and other illnesses compromise their immune systems.	世界每三个人中就有一个人感染了潜伏性或亚临床结核病，而且科学家预测其中10%会随着年龄增长和其他疾病影响免疫系统而表现出结核病的症状。
In 2015, more than ten million new cases of TB were reported, and almost two million people died from it.	2015年报告了超过1000万例新增结核病，而且近200万人因此而死亡。
There are three reasons why TB persists: political leaders do not understand the sociology behind it, scientists lack an effective paradigm to attack it, and the rich and famous no longer die from it.	有三个原因导致结核病无法根除：政治领袖不懂它背后的社会学、科学家缺乏有效的方式来打击它，而结核病不再对名人和富豪的生命构成威胁。
TB once affected every stratum of society, but it now afflicts the most vulnerable populations.	结核病曾影响到社会的各个阶层，现在却只对最弱势群体构成影响。
This makes it an ideal meme for artists and activists who focus on social justice.	它因此成为专注社会正义的艺术家和活动人士的理想对象。
The incidence of drug-resistant TB is on the rise, because the health-care systems of poor countries lack the resources to screen for TB and to help patients comply with their therapies.	耐药性结核病的发病率正在上升，因为贫穷国家的医疗卫生系统缺乏筛查结核病的资源和帮助患者接受治疗的方法。
Six countries – India, Indonesia, China, Nigeria, Pakistan, and South Africa – account for 60% of all reported TB cases.	印度、印尼、中国、尼日利亚、巴基斯坦和南非等六国在所有报告结核病例中占据60%的份额。
Russia may be willfully underreporting its TB burden, and some African countries do not know how many of their citizens are infected.	俄罗斯可能有意隐瞒其结核病例，而有些非洲国家则不清楚国内有多少民众感染。
Political leaders have failed to understand the sociological factors behind TB.	政治领袖未能掌握结核病背后的社会学因素。
For example, the disease’s prevalence does not usually increase after natural disasters, but it did in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, owing partly to the policies of the United Nations and USAID.	例如，自然灾害通常不会增加结核病感染率，但2010年海地地震后却部分因联合国和美国国际开发署的政策而导致结核发病率有所增加。
Refugee camps were crowded, the sanitation was poor, children were chronically malnourished, and financial incentives caused many to extend their stay there.	难民营拥挤不堪，卫生条件极差；儿童长期营养不良，而经济刺激导致很多人长期在那里生活。
TB afflicts many people who do not vote, such as refugees, prisoners, and the destitute.	很多感染结核病的人没有投票权，包括难民、囚犯和贫困人口。
Prisons and slums also serve as breeding grounds for TB, and young women on the periphery of society can infect their children.	监狱和贫民窟也是结核病的孳生地，生活在社会边缘的年轻女性可能感染她们的后代。
The World Health Organization states that TB-infected mothers are “associated with a six-fold increase in perinatal deaths.”	世卫组织称感染结核病的母亲“围产期死亡率增长六倍之多 ” 。
Mother Teresa worked for decades with TB’s victims in the slums of Calcutta, and observed that, “The biggest disease today is not leprosy or tuberculosis, but rather the feeling of being unwanted.”	特蕾莎修女曾在加尔各答贫民窟与结核病患者相处数十年，她观察的结果是 ， “ 当今最严重的疾病不是麻风病和结核病，而是被社会抛弃的感觉 。 ”
Discrimination, stigma, and isolation are not just pernicious features of weak societies; they foster conditions that facilitate TB infections and increase the rate of diffusion.	歧视、耻辱和孤立不仅是弱势群体的致命特点；它们加速结核病感染，并增加感染率。
Partners in Health (PIH), which runs TB clinics in South America, the Caribbean, and Africa, may be among those who get it right.	我们或许可以借鉴在南美、加勒比和非洲开设结核病诊所的健康伙伴机构（PIH）的做法。
Peter Drobac, who ran their programs, told me that PIH trains people in small villages to identify the disease early and to administer treatment properly, as well as to build policy systems that focus on the underlying values of self-determination and compassion, which strengthen any society.	负责管理项目的彼得·达罗巴奇告诉我健康伙伴机构对村民进行培训，教会他们迅速识别早期结核病并正确地加以治疗，健康伙伴机构还努力建设关注自决和同情等基本价值观的政策体系，这样的体系能使任何社会的抗风险能力得到加强。
Innovation often comes from introducing insights and tools from a different domain.	创新往往源于全新领域认识能力和工具的引入。
Maybe TB behaves more like cancer than like other infectious diseases.	或许与其他传染病相比结核病与癌症具有更高的相似度。
Daryl Drummond – a vice president of Merrimack Pharmaceuticals and one of the innovators behind the only second-line treatment for pancreatic cancer approved by the US Food and Drug Administration – told me that the lung lesions from a TB infection “share a marked similarity with solid tumors.”	美国联邦药品管理局批准的唯一胰腺癌二线药品发明者，梅里马克制药公司副总裁达里尔·德拉蒙德告诉我结核病感染造成的肺部病变“与实体肿瘤非常相像 。 ”
In fact, he explained, “the TB granuloma has many of the pathological features of cancer: hypoxia, a necrotic core, fibrous collagen at the outer rim, the development of a surrounding capillary network, and the presence of phagocytic cells.”	事实上，结核性肉芽肿具有许多癌症的病理特征：组织缺氧、核心坏死、外缘胶原纤维化、周遭发展出毛细血管网和出现吞噬细胞。
If Drummond is right, those engaged in the fight against TB could look for ways in other branches of medicine to shorten treatment duration, lower dosing frequency, reduce side effects, lower costs, and improve compliance, all at the same time.	如果德拉蒙德所言不虚，那么结核病防治工作者可以在其他医学领域寻找同时能缩短治疗时间、降低给药频率、降低成本和改善依从性的方法。
Drummond added, “We are finding ways to achieve these things in oncology."	德拉蒙德补充道 ， “ 我们正在想法设法在肿瘤治疗中达到上述目标 。 ”
Unfortunately, commercial innovation is slow to respond to TB.	不幸的是，商业创新对结核病响应迟缓。
As World Bank President and PIH co-founder Jim Yong Kim points out, “If you look at the three major killers – HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria – the only disease for which we have really good drugs is HIV.	正如世行行长兼健康伙伴机构创始人金墉所指出的那样 ， “ 在三大主要杀手 — — 艾滋病、结核病及疟疾中 — — 唯一有特效药可用的是艾滋病。
The reason is simple: there’s a market in the United States and Europe.”	原因很简单：美国和欧洲有市场 。 ”
TB, by contrast, is often thought of as a “third-world” or poor person’s disease.	相比之下，结核病往往被视为属于“第三世界”或者穷人。
Some of the most profitable and powerful pharmaceutical companies in the world, AstraZeneca and Pfizer, have left that “market” behind.	全球某些最大最赚钱的制药企业，如阿斯利康和辉瑞，都对结核病“市场”不屑一顾。
Tony Fauci, Director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which, since 1984, has helped to lead successful global efforts against HIV and Zika, takes a different perspective.	1984年来协助领导全球抗击艾滋病和寨卡工作的美国国家过敏和传染病研究所主任托尼·福奇的观点与众不同。
“Collectively,” he reminds us, “we should be paying more attention to what is going on around us in the world among people who don’t have the advantages that we have.”	“作为整体 ” ， 他提醒我们 ， “ 我们应当更关注周边国家劣势群体所过的生活 。 ”
North Americans and Europeans need to lift their fingers out of “the greasy till of commerce” and see the end of TB as a challenge to our collective humanity.	北美及欧洲人必须从“油腻腻的商业钱匣中”抽出手来，将消灭结核病视为全人类的共同事业。
It has certainly been a challenge to many of history’s greatest artists and activists.	结核病对历史上很多伟大艺术家和活动家而言无疑是一个挑战。
Henry David Thoreau, Eleanor Roosevelt, George Orwell, Franz Kafka, Louis Braille, Wallace Thurman, and Simón Bolívar struggled with or against alienation, isolation, and injustice.	亨利·大卫·梭罗、埃莉诺·罗斯福、乔治·奥威尔、弗兰茨·卡夫卡、路易斯·布莱叶、华莱士·瑟曼和西蒙·玻利瓦尔都曾反抗异化、隔离和不公正。
They all died of TB.	他们都是死于结核病。
Nelson Mandela was diagnosed with TB while serving his 27-year prison term in a dank cell.	纳尔逊·曼德拉在一间阴暗牢房完成其27年刑期期间被诊断出结核病。
Two liters of fluid were drained from his chest, and he recuperated in a hospital that had never treated a black patient.	从他的胸部抽出了两升液体，他在一家从未治疗过黑人患者的医院接受治疗。
If such eminent people contracted TB today, how fast could our governments and corporations find a cure?	如果这样的知名人士今天患上结核病，我们的政府和企业多快能找到治愈方法？
How many of the 400,000 children who die from TB each year could grow up, fight for social justice through art, activism, and commerce, and inspire the rest of us to do the same?	每年死于结核病的400,000儿童有多少本来可以长大成人，通过艺术、社会活动和商业为社会平等而战，并激励我们其他人加入到这项事业当中？
	
Why Turkey's Army Will Stay Home	为什么土耳其的军队会呆在国内
Just when the smoke from Turkey’s domestic political conflicts of the past year had begun to clear, another deadly attack by Kurdish separatists on Turkish soldiers has the government threatening military attacks inside northern Iraq.	正当过去一年土耳其国内政治斗争的硝烟刚刚开始散去时，库尔德分离主义者攻击土耳其军队导致多名军人死亡的事件使政府威胁要在伊拉克北部实施军队打击。
That prospect raises risks for Turkey, Iraq, and the United States.	这种前景给土耳其、伊拉克和美国都带来了巨大的风险。
But there are reasons to doubt that the situation is as dangerous as recent headlines suggest.	但是有理由怀疑形势是否真的像最近报纸大字标题上所写的那样危险。
Turkey accuses Iraqi Kurds of harboring between 3,000 and 3,500 of Turkey’s most active Kurdish militants – the PKK separatist guerillas who are blamed for the deaths of 80 Turkish soldiers so far this year.	土耳其谴责伊拉克库尔德地区藏匿了3000到3500名土耳其最最活跃的库尔德武装分子库尔德工人党分离主义者的游击队员，他们被指责在今年已经造成了80名土耳其军人死亡。
The trouble reached the boiling point on October 7, when Kurdish fighters killed 13 Turkish soldiers near Turkey’s border with Iraq.	这个问题在10月7日达到了沸点，当天库尔德武装分子在土耳其与伊拉克交界附近打死了13名土耳其军人。
The Turkish public has demanded action, and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government has responded.	土耳其公众要求采取行动，并且埃尔多安总理领导的政府也作出了反应。
On October 17, despite pleas for patience and restraint from Iraq and the US, Turkish lawmakers voted 507-19 to authorize Erdogan to order cross-border military strikes into Iraq at any time over the next year.	10月17日，尽管伊拉克和美国都呼吁保持耐心和克制，但是土耳其的立法者还是以507票赞成对19票反对授权埃尔多安在明年的任何时间下令越境进入伊拉克实施军事打击。
Erdogan has sent Iraqi Kurds a forceful message.	埃尔多安向伊拉克库尔德人发出了一个有力的信息。
But, for several reasons, the Turkish military is likely to limit its operations to small-scale incursions and air strikes on specific targets rather than launch an all-out war.	但是，有好几个原因会使土耳其军队很可能把它的军事行动限制在小规模的入侵和对特定目标实施空中打击上，而不会爆发一场全面战争。
First, the Turkish military has no interest in embracing the risks that come with involvement in Iraq’s sectarian strife.	首先，土耳其军队并不想面对介入伊拉克的宗派斗争所带来的风险。
A full-scale invasion might well provoke Iraq’s own Kurdish guerrillas into a prolonged and bloody battle with Turkish forces that can only undermine support for Erdogan’s government at home and abroad.	全面入侵很可能会激起伊拉克国内的库尔德游击队员与土耳其军队进行一场漫长而又血腥的斗争，这只会削弱埃尔多安政府在国内和国际所受到的支持。
Second, Turkey’s government hopes to keep the country’s bid to join the European Union moving forward.	第二，土耳其政府希望继续这个国家加入欧盟的进程。
An invasion of Iraq would bring that process to a grinding halt.	而入侵伊拉克会使这一进程嘎然而止。
EU Foreign Policy chief Javier Solana has made plain that Europe strongly opposes any large-scale Turkish military operation in Iraq.	欧盟负责外交事务的高级代表索拉纳已经明确表示欧洲强烈反对土耳其军队在伊拉克境内实施任何大规模的军事行动。
Third, Turkey is well aware that an all-out attack inside Iraq is exactly what Turkey’s Kurdish separatists want.	第三，土耳其很清楚在伊拉克境内实施全面军事打击正是土耳其的库尔德分离主义者所梦寐以求的。
What better way to damage Turkey than to pull its military into conflict with Iraq, the US, and the EU?	还有什么比把土耳其的军队拉上与伊拉克、美国还有欧盟对抗之路更能损害它的利益的呢？
Erdogan has no intention of being drawn into that trap.	埃尔多安是不愿意掉进这个陷阱的。
With all that in mind, this latest move by Turkey’s parliament should be seen more as an ultimatum to Iraq’s Kurdish Regional Government to expel the Turkish Kurds and an attempt to persuade the US to use its considerable influence there.	正因为考虑到这些原因，土耳其议会最近的举动应该更多地被看作是要求伊拉克库尔德地区政府驱逐土耳其库尔德人的最后通牒以及试图劝说美国发挥其在当地相当的影响力。
That’s hardball politics, not a declaration of war.	这是强硬方式的政治，而不是宣战。
The parliamentary authorization itself is carefully worded to underline Turkey’s limited aims.	议会的授权本身用词也很谨慎，强调土耳其的有限目标。
It stresses that Turkey’s military has no intention of occupying Iraqi territory or threatening Iraqi Kurds or their oil infrastructure.	它强调说土耳其的军队并不想占领伊拉克的领土或者威胁伊拉克库尔德人抑或他们的石油基础设施。
An attack would certainly make Iraq’s Kurdish provinces less appealing for foreign investors.	一次打击很可能会使伊拉克的库尔德省份对外国投资者不再那么有吸引力。
But Turkey has no reason to attack the assets of foreign oil companies.	但是土耳其没有理由攻击外国的石油公司。
Iraq’s central government is aware of the risks, as well, and is likely to exercise maximum restraint.	伊拉克中央政府很清楚风险所在，并且很可能会保持最大限度的克制。
A limited Turkish strike into northern Iraq would probably elicit little reaction beyond public condemnation and rhetorical assertions of Iraqi sovereignty.	土耳其对伊拉克北部地区实施的有限的军事打击除开会使伊拉克当局作出公开谴责和口头宣称伊拉克的主权外，不会再引起其他反应。
Threats to Iraq’s oil infrastructure around the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk and other territory under the Kurdish Regional Government’s control are minimal.	对伊拉克北部城市基尔库克周围的石油基础设施和库尔德地区政府控制下的领土的威胁是非常小的。
Turkey’s government knows that any move to shut down the 600-mile pipeline from Kirkuk to Turkey’s Mediterranean port at Ceyhan would have little near-term impact, since most of Iraq’s oil exports flow from the south, hundreds of miles from the country’s border with Turkey.	土耳其政府知道任何关闭由基尔库克通向土耳其位于地中海的查伊汉港600英里长的石油管道的行动近期不太可能产生多少影响，因为伊拉克石油出口的大部分是从南部出去的，与该国跟土耳其的交界处相隔了数百英里。
Furthermore, the Turkish military can increase the pressure on Iraqi Kurds with far less drastic measures.	此外，土耳其军队运用远没有那么猛烈的措施就能给伊拉克库尔德人增加压力。
It can close the two countries’ principal border crossing, an important route for food, fuel, and other goods headed for Iraqi Kurds.	它还可以关闭两国主要的过境通道，这是运往伊拉克库尔德地区的食品、燃料和其他物资的重要路线。
It could also cut exports of electricity to northern Iraq.	它还可以减少输往伊拉克北部地区的电力。
Still, even small-scale military operations would generate risk.	然而，即便是小��模的军事行动也会带来风险。
If the PKK is able to launch a major attack on troops or civilians inside Turkey, the public outcry might leave Erdogan with little choice but to up the ante.	如果库尔德工人党能够对土耳其境内的军队或平民发动一次重大打击，公众的强烈抗议会使埃尔多安除了增加赌注外别无选择。
The issue is complicated further by Turkey’s refusal to negotiate directly with the Kurdish Regional Government in northern Iraq.	这个问题因为土耳其拒绝与伊拉克北部的库尔德地区政府进行直接谈判而变得更加复杂了。
Such talks, Turkey fears, would offer tacit acknowledgement that Iraqi Kurds have won a degree of autonomy from Baghdad.	土耳其方面担心这种谈判会等同于默认伊拉克库尔德人已经从巴格达获得了一定程度的自治权。
That’s a bridge too far for Turkey’s nationalists and its military.	那对于土耳其的民族主义者和它的军队来说是不太可能做的。
There are risks for Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki as well, because Turkish military strikes on Iraq’s northern provinces could undermine the Kurdish support on which his government increasingly depends.	伊拉克总理马利基也承受着一定的风险，因为土耳其军队在伊拉克北部省份实施的军事打击会严重削弱他的政府越来越依赖的库尔德人的支持。
Both Sunni Arabs and Kurds already resent al Maliki’s mild reaction to Iran’s recent shelling of Iraqi territory – an attempt to strike at Iranian Kurdish militants fleeing across its border with Iraq.	逊尼派阿拉伯人和库尔德人都对马利基对于伊朗最近轰炸伊拉克领土的行动 — — 以便打击通过越境逃到伊拉克境内的一支伊朗库尔德人武装力量 — — 所作出的温和反应深表不满。
There are also risks for the US.	美国同样也承受着风险。
Most supplies headed for US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan move through the Incirlik airbase in Turkey.	大部分运往驻扎在伊拉克和阿富汗的美国军队的物资都是通过土耳其的因切利克空军机场进行的。
With the threat that the US House of Representatives will approve a resolution that accuses Turks of genocide against ethic Armenians nine decades ago, this is a particularly inopportune moment for the two countries to be at odds over Iraq.	面对美国众议院威胁要通过一项谴责土耳其人在90年前对亚美尼亚族人实施种族灭绝的决议，两国在伊拉克问题上产生分歧真是显得特别不合时宜。
But, worst-case scenarios aside, a Turkish invasion of northern Iraq can only serve the interests of Turkey’s Kurdish separatists.	但是，除这些最糟糕的状况，土耳其对伊拉克北部的入侵只会使土耳其的库尔德分离主义者得益。
That’s why cooler heads are likely to prevail.	正因为如此，头脑清醒的人到最后很可能会占据上风。
Limited cross-border operations are increasingly likely.	有限的越境军事行动的可能性变得越来越大了。
A war between Turkey and Iraqi Kurds is not.	但是土耳其与伊拉克库尔德人爆发战争却并不太可能。
	
Why Ukraine Deserves a Haircut	为何乌克兰债券需要减值
LONDON – In addition to its many other troubles, Ukraine now finds itself in a showdown with its creditors.	发自伦敦 — — 除了自身众多问题之外，乌克兰如今也到了跟其债权人摊牌的时候。
Investors holding high-yielding bonds – many of them bought at heavy discounts after Russia’s annexation of Crimea last year – are demanding to be paid in full.	那些持有高息债券 — — 其中许多都是在去年俄罗斯吞并克里米亚之后大幅折价购入 — — 的投资者都在要求连本带息全额支付。
Ukraine’s government, for its part, argues that the country’s financial difficulties – in particular the economic effects of the conflict and the plunge in the value of the hryvnia – have made its debt burden unsustainable.	而乌克兰政府方面则声称本国所面对的经济困难 — — 尤其是军事冲突带来的经济冲击和本国货币格里夫尼亚的大幅贬值 — — 使得自身债务负担无以为继。
The outcome of this standoff could determine Ukraine’s future, as much as the military confrontation with Russia.	这一对峙状况的结果将和与俄罗斯的军事冲突一道觉得这个国家的未来。
Recent developments have put the country on a path that would have been unimaginable until very recently.	最近局势的发展已经将乌克兰推向了一条原本无法想象的道路。
For the first time in Ukraine’s post-Soviet history, it has a government that is willing and able to carry out real reform.	在苏联解体之后，乌克兰首次建立了一个有意愿且有能力推动真正改革的政府。
Ukraine’s progress, however, could not be more fragile.	然而乌克兰的进步之路也极之脆弱。
Without some form of debt relief, it could easily be lost.	如果无法实现某种形式的债务削减的话，就会轻易灰飞烟灭。
A little over a year ago, Ukraine did not have an elected president or a representative and functioning parliament.	就在不到一年之前，乌克兰还缺乏一位民选总统，也没有一个具有代表性和正常运作的议会。
The political landscape was deeply fragmented.	整个政治图景极为碎片化。
Civil society had been energized by the Maidan revolution that ousted former President Viktor Yanukovych, but it was in turmoil.	公民社会在推翻了前总统维克多·亚努科维奇（Viktor Yanukovych）的广场革命驱动下建立了起来，但如今却陷入了混乱。
Debate over the association agreement with the European Union, along with the Russian-backed rebellion in the east, had stoked tensions over distinctions that previously played little or no role in people’s lives.	针对欧盟联系国协议的讨论，在加上俄罗斯支持下的东部叛乱，使得人们在生活中原本微不足道的细微区别之上剑拔弩张，紧张不已。
But since parliamentary elections in October, Ukraine has begun to pull itself together.	但自去年10月的议会选举后，乌克兰已经开始振作起来。
Russia’s intervention has to some extent backfired, strengthening support for a European orientation.	俄罗斯的干预在一定程度上适得其反，反而加强了乌克兰对欧洲的向心力。
Eastern Ukraine may have voted differently from the rest of the country, but the overwhelming majority of voters came out in favor of Europe.	虽然乌克兰东部的投票结果可能与该国其余地区不同，但支持偏爱欧洲的选民依然会占绝大多数。
The electorate also said no to the more virulent forms of nationalism, leaving the right-wing extremist parties marginalized.	选民们也拒绝了更致命形式的民族主义，把右翼极端党派晾在了一边。
The result of the elections was the formation of a five-party governing coalition.	选举最终结果是组成了一个五党执政联盟。
Though seemingly fragile, it has held up remarkably well.	虽然看似脆弱，但团结却相当紧密。
Some of its members have displayed worrying populist tendencies, but an analysis of parliamentary voting patterns indicates that so far the coalition has been able to find agreement, even on very difficult issues.	它的一些成员显示出令人担忧的民粹主义倾向，但对议会投票模式的分析表明，到目前为止，即使是在非常棘手的问题上联盟依然能够达成共识。
The government has, among other things, raised gas tariffs by 450% (from absurdly low levels).	除此之外，政府把天然气关税（从原本荒谬的低水平）提高了450 % 。
Dissension has been relatively moderate.	各派之间斗争也一直相对温和。
As a result, Ukraine’s core institutions are undergoing fundamental change.	在此基础之上，乌克兰的核心体制正在经历根本性的变化。
The central bank – once in the pocket of the country’s oligarchs, supplying inside information on exchange rates and liquidity in exchange for bribes – has been put under the command of a governor committed to reform, surrounded by an increasingly professional team.	中央银行 — — 曾经是国内寡头的囊中物，通过提供汇率和流动性的内部信息以换取贿赂 — — 已经任命了一位致力于改革的行长，招募了一个更为专业的团队。
The energy monopoly Naftogaz, previously a cesspool of illicit transactions, has in a year managed the seemingly impossible: making Ukraine virtually independent from direct gas delivery from Russia for at least a year.	能源寡头乌克兰天然气公司过去一直是充斥非法交易的藏污纳垢之地，却在这一年多以来实现了看似不可能的任务：让乌克兰几乎摆脱了对俄罗斯天然气的依赖。
Perhaps Ukraine’s single most important achievement is the establishment of the National Reform Council.	而或许乌克兰最重要的成就则是建立国家改革委员会。
Originally set up to coordinate reforms across ministries and monitor their implementation, it has come to serve as an important tool to discuss and ensure coherence among the different branches of government.	原本是为了协调跨部门改革并监督其进程，如今委员会已成为讨论和确保政府各部门之间一致性的重要工具。
This latter role is particularly important, given the constitutional ambiguity created by the reversion back to a parliamentary system and the uneasy co-habitation of President Petro Poroshenko and Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk in government.	鉴于向议会体系的回归所产生的体制模糊状况，以及总统彼得·波罗申科（Petro Poroshenko）和总理阿尔谢尼·亚采纽克（Arseniy Yatsenyuk）在政府中一山难容二虎的形势，后者的作用尤为重要。
Meetings are held every three weeks and are attended by the president, the prime minister, and his entire cabinet, providing a forum in which tensions can be discussed and eased.	会议每三周举行一次，总统、总理和他的整个内阁都会出席，为大家提供了一个可以讨论和缓解紧张关系的平台。
In between meetings, the council’s special project-management office assists in the preparation and implementation of key reforms by ministries.	在会议期间，委员会的特别项目管理办公室协助各部委策划和实施关键改革。
With support from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the George Soros-funded International Renaissance Foundation, and bilateral assistance from, among others, the Swedish government, the office has been able to hire staff at market rates, raising the quality of the government administration.	在欧洲复兴开发银行，乔治•索罗斯（George Soros）资助国际复兴基金会以及瑞典等多国政府的双边援助下，办公室已经能够以市场认可的工资水平雇佣员工，从而提高政府管理的质量。
Ukraine’s government has also benefited from the expertise of private-sector leaders.	乌克兰政府也受益于私营部门领导人的专业知识。
Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration Dmytro Shymkiv, who drove the National Reform Council, was CEO of Microsoft Ukraine.	主管国家改革委员会的总统办公厅副主任迪米特罗·什姆基夫（Dmytro Shymkiv）是原微软乌克兰分公司的首席执行官。
Finance Minister Natalie Jaresko and Economic Development and Trade Minister Aivaras Abromavicius were both investment bankers (neither was a Ukrainian citizen when they joined the government).	财���部长娜塔莉·雅雷斯科（Natalie Jaresko）和经济发展与贸易部长艾瓦拉斯·阿布罗马维丘斯（Aivaras Abromavicius）都曾是投资银行家（两人在加入政府时都不是乌克兰公民 ） 。
Infrastructure Minister Andriy Pivovarsky, also a former investment banker, was most recently CEO of Continium, one of the country’s largest holding companies.	基础设施部长安德烈·皮沃瓦尔斯基（Andriy Pivovarsky）也是前投资银行家，曾任全国最大的控股公司之一Continium集团的CEO。
Each has played a key role in pushing the reform agenda forward, working for salaries that are orders of magnitude smaller than what they earned before.	他们每一位都为推动改革议程向前发展发挥了关键作用，也在为比从前少得多的工资在工作。
Some have even employed staff using their own money.	有些人甚至自己花钱来雇佣员工。
Meanwhile, the ambitious agendas of the government ministers and the presidential administration are closely monitored by an energized civil society.	同时，政府部长和总统办公厅的宏伟议程由一个充满活力的民间社会来密切监察着。
As Soros has noted, Ukraine probably has the most active civil society in Europe.	正如索罗斯指出的那样，乌克兰可能有着全欧最活跃的公民社会。
One of the country’s most interesting new ventures is VoxUkraine, a blogging platform set up by two Ukrainian economics professors based in the United States, Yuriy Gorodnichenko and Timofiy Mylovanov.	该国其中一个最有趣的新企业是VoxUkraine，一个由尤里·哥罗尼申科（Yuriy Gorodnichenko）和蒂莫西·米洛万诺夫（Timofiy Mylovanov）两位在美乌克兰经济学教授建立的博客平台。
They have championed modern evidence-based decision-making and constantly come up with new, constructive ways of challenging the government and its assumptions.	他们倡导实施现代循证型决策，不断提出新的、有建设性的方式来挑战政府及其政策设想。
Despite all this progress, however, the odds remain stacked against the country.	尽管取得了这些进步，形势依然对乌克兰不利。
The government is fighting at least two wars simultaneously – taking on a deeply entrenched oligarchy, while trying to fend off its hostile eastern neighbor.	政府同时在参与至少两场战争 — — 在试图抵御敌对东部邻国的同时还要对抗根深蒂固的寡头政治。
Further trouble – in the form a steeply declining economy – is something it cannot afford.	更麻烦的问题 — — 以经济急剧下滑的形式呈现 — — 则是政府无法承受的。
The stakes could not be higher.	但改革的红利也是极大的。
For the first time since the country gained its independence in 1992, Ukraine has a clear sense of direction and a government capable of supporting reform.	自1992年独立以来，乌克兰第一次有了一个明确的方向和一个能够支持改革的政府。
There are signs that the oligarchs’ grip is beginning to loosen, owing partly to internal conflicts among them.	有迹象表明，在某种程度上由于寡头之间的内部冲突，他们对国家的钳制开始有放松迹象。
The EU and the US are working to help resolve its conflict with Russia.	欧盟和美国正努力帮助乌克兰解决与俄罗斯的冲突。
Ukraine’s private creditors must now do their part, recognize the country’s economic and political situation, and accept a haircut on their bonds.	因此乌克兰的私人债权人现在必须认识到国家的经济和政治形势，接受债券减值。
Neither the Ukrainian economy – nor its political system – can afford that they do otherwise.	否则无论是乌克兰经济 — — 还是政治体制 — — 都无法承受其他的方案。
	
When Inflation Doves Cry	当通胀鸽派得势
PITTSBURGH – The Wall Street Journal recently ran a front-page article reporting that the monetary-policy “doves,” who had forecast low inflation in the United States, have gotten the better of the “hawks,” who argued that the Fed’s monthly purchases of long-term securities, or so-called quantitative easing (QE), would unleash faster price growth.	匹兹堡 — 《 华尔街日报》最近刊登了一篇头版文章报道，说预测美国通胀将保持低位的货币政策“鸽派”已经压倒了认为美联储每月购买长期证券的计划，即所谓的量化宽松（QE）将加速物价上涨的“鹰派 ” 。
The report was correct but misleading, for it failed to mention why there is so little inflation in the US today.	报道说的没错，但有误导之嫌，因为它没有提及为何现今美国通胀如此之低。
Were the doves right, or just lucky?	是鸽派对了，还是仅仅因为幸运？
The US Federal Reserve Board has pumped out trillions of dollars of reserves, but never have so many reserves produced so little monetary growth.	美联储董事会抛出了数万亿美元的准备金，但如此之多的准备金只造成如此至少的货币增长，这是从未有过的事情。
Neither the hawks nor the doves (nor anyone else) expected that.	鹰派和鸽派（和任何其他人）都没有料到会如此。
Monetarists insist that economies experience inflation when money-supply growth persistently exceeds output growth.	货币主义者坚持认为，当货币供给持续高于产出增长时，经济会经历通胀。
That has not happened yet, so inflation has been postponed.	但这并没有发生，因此通胀一直起不来。
Instead of rejecting monetary theory and history, the army of Wall Street soothsayers should look beyond the Fed’s press releases and ask themselves: Does it make sense to throw out centuries of experience?	华尔街预言家不应该拒绝接受货币理论和历史，而应该让目光超越美联储新闻稿，扪心自问：否定几百年的经验有意义吗？
Are we really so confident that the Fed has found a new way?	我们真的这么有信心，认为美联储已经找到了新道路？
The Fed has printed new bank reserves with reckless abandon.	美联储毫无忌惮地大手笔印着新银行准备金。
But almost all of the reserves sit idle on commercial banks’ balance sheets.	但这些准备金几乎全部闲置在商业银行的资产负债表上。
For the 12 months ending in July, the St. Louis Fed reports that bank reserves rose 31%.	在截至7月的12个月中，圣路易斯联邦储备银行报告其银行准备金增加了31 % 。
During the same period, a commonly used measure of monetary growth, M2, increased by only 6.8%.	同一时期，常用货币增长指标M2只增加了6.8 % 。
No sound monetarist thinks those numbers predict current inflation.	没有哪位严谨的货币主义者会认为这些数字意味着当前通胀。
Indeed, almost all the reserves added in the second and third rounds of QE, more than 95%, are sitting in excess reserves, neither lent nor borrowed and never used to increase money in circulation.	事实上，几乎所有在第二轮和第三轮QE期间增加的准备金（超过95 % ） 以超额准备金的形式存在着，既没有借贷，也没有用于增加流通中货币。
The Fed pays the banks 0.25% to keep them idle.	美联储为了这些闲置资金向银行支付0.25%的利息。
With $2 trillion in excess reserves, and the prospect of as much as $85 billion added each month, banks receive $5 billion a year, and rising, without taking any risk.	超额准备金高达2万亿美元，而且预计将以每个月850亿美元的速度增加，银行将因此每年获得50亿美元（而且会越来越多 ） ， 还不用承担任何风险。
For the bankers, that’s a bonanza, paid from monies that the Fed would normally pay to the US Treasury.	对银行家来说，这简直是天降馅饼，这笔钱通常是美联储付给美国财政部的。
And, adding insult to injury, about half the payment goes to branches of foreign banks.	此外，雪上加霜的是，一半的支付额流入了外国银行的分支机构。
In normal times, there are valid reasons for paying interest on excess reserves.	在正常时期，可以找到充分的理由论证应该向超额准备金支付利息。
Currently, however, it is downright counter-productive.	但是，目前这么做不利于生产。
Bank loans have started to increase, but small borrowers, new borrowers, and start-up companies are regularly refused.	银行贷款已开始增加，但小型借款人、新借款人和创业公司总是吃闭门羹。
Current low interest rates do not cover the risk that banks would take.	当前的低利率不能覆盖银行所冒的风险。
To be sure, they could raise the rate for new and small borrowers; but, in the current political climate, they would stand accused of stifling economic recovery if they did.	诚然，它们可以针对新借款人和小借款人提高利息；但是，在当前的政治气候下，这么做会让它们受到千夫所指，认为它们妨碍复苏。
The new Consumer Financial Protection Board is also a deterrent, as banks consider it safer to lend to the government, large corporations, and giant real-estate speculators.	新的消费者金融保护委员会也成了妨碍因素，因为银行认为借钱给政府、大公司和大型房地产投机商更加安全。
The banks can report record profits without much risk, rebuild capital, and pay dividends and bonuses.	银行可以报告利润，有不同承担高风险；可以冲减资本；可以支付股票红利和奖金。
And the Fed can congratulate itself on the mostly unobserved way that the large banks have used taxpayers’ money.	而美联储也可以暗自庆幸，大银行用难以看到的方式用了纳税人的钱。
Instead of continuing along this futile path, the Fed should end its open-ended QE3 now.	美联储不应该继续坚持这一徒劳无益的政策，而应该马上结束无限制QE3。
It should stop paying interest on excess reserves until the US economy returns to a more normal footing.	美联储应该停止向超额准备金支付利息，直到美国经济站稳脚跟。
Most important, it should announce a strategy for eliminating the massive volume of such reserves.	最重要的是，美联储应该宣布消灭如此巨量准备金的战略。
I am puzzled, and frankly appalled, by the Fed’s failure to explain how it will restore its balance sheet to a non-inflationary level.	我很困惑，坦白说是惊骇，美联储一直没有解释它将如何让其资产负债表恢复到无通胀水平。
The announcements to date simply increase uncertainty without telling the public anything useful.	目前所宣布的政策只能增加不确定性，而没有告诉公众任何有用的信息。
Selling $2 trillion of reserves will take years.	拍卖2万亿准备金要花上多年时间。
It must do more than repeat that the Fed can raise interest rates paid on reserves to encourage banks to hold them.	除了重申美联储可能增加准备金利率以鼓励银行持有它们之外，美联储还需要做些另外的事。
It will take a clearly stated, widely understood strategy – the kind that Paul Volcker introduced in 1979-1982 – to complete the job.	为此，美联储必须给出明确的、被广泛理解的战略，就像1979—1982年保罗·沃克尔（Paul Volcker）做的那样。
Should the end of QE come in September, December, or later?	QE的结束会在9月、12月还是更晚发生？
Does it matter?	这重要吗？
Historically, the Fed has typically been slow to respond to inflation.	从历史上看，美联储对通胀的反应总是慢半拍。
Waiting until inflation is here, as some propose, is the usual way.	正如一些人所指出的，坐等通胀出现是美联储的惯常做法。
But that merely fuels inflation expectations and makes the task more painful.	但这只能助长通胀预期，让任务更加艰巨。
And how high will the Fed push up interest rates?	美联储会把利率提高到何种高度？
Once rates get to 5% or 6%, assuming inflation remains dormant, the Fed can expect a backlash from Congress, the administration, unions, homebuilders, and others.	如果���率达到5%或6 % ， 假设通胀仍然低迷，那么美联储将受到国会、政府、工会、业主和其他人的口诛笔伐。
When contemplating the consequences of this, remember that 40% of US government debt comes due within two years.	在思考这些后果时，必须牢记40%的美国政府债务将于两年内到期。
Rolling it over at higher rates of 4% or 5% would add more than $100 billion to the budget deficit.	以更高的利率 — — 4%或5 % — —展期将导致预算赤字增加1000多亿美元。
And that is just the first two years.	而这仅仅是最初两年。
The budget cost increases every year, as more of the debt rolls over – and that does not include agency debt and the large increase in the current-account deficit to pay China, Japan, and other foreign holders of US debt.	随着更多的债务展期，预算成本将逐年太高 — — 这还不算政府机构债务和经常项目赤字的增加以支付中国、日本和其他美国债务外国债权人。
Those who believe that inflation will remain low should look more thoroughly and think more clearly.	认为通胀将保持低迷者应该看得更通透一些，想得更明了一些。
There are plenty of good textbooks that explain what too many policymakers and financial-market participants would rather forget.	有很多决策者和金融市场参与者忘记的东西原原本本地躺在出色的教科书中。
	
Send in the Clowns	小丑上台
NEW YORK – When too many Italians voted late last month for either a louche and discredited business tycoon or a comedian, European stock markets plummeted.	纽约 — — 上月底，太多意大利人投票选举一位声名狼藉的商业大亨和一名喜剧演员导致欧洲股市出现暴跌。
With no public trust in the political class, Italy might become ungovernable.	公众对政治阶层失去信任可能导致意大利局势失控。
But Italians are not alone.	但意大利人绝非个别现象。
Rage against the political establishment has become a global phenomenon.	对政治体制的怒火在世界各地随处可见。
Chinese bloggers, American Tea Party activists, British Europhobes, Egyptian Islamists, Dutch populists, Greek ultra-rightists, and Thai “red shirts” all have one thing in common: hatred of the status quo and contempt for their countries’ elites.	中国的博客写手、美国的茶党激进分子、英国的恐欧主义者、埃及的伊斯兰教徒、荷兰的民粹主义者、希腊的极右派和泰国的“红衫军”都有一个共同点：仇恨现状及鄙视国内精英阶层。
We are living in an age of populism.	我们生活在民粹主义时代。
The authority of conventional politicians and traditional media is slipping away fast.	传统的政治家和传统媒体正在迅速丧失权威。
Populism can be a necessary corrective when political parties grow sclerotic, mass media become too complacent (or too close to power), and bureaucracies are unresponsive to popular needs.	民粹主义可以作为对政党僵化、大众媒体自满（或太过亲权 ） 、 以及官僚机构对大众需求反应迟钝的一种必要的修复。
In a globalized world managed by bankers and technocrats, many people feel that they have no say in public affairs; they feel abandoned.	很多人在由银行家和技术专家管理的全球化世界中感觉丧失了公共事务发言权，这些人感到被抛弃了。
Our national politicians, increasingly powerless to cope with serious crises, are suspected, often with good reason, of simply looking after their own interests.	国内政治家应对严重危机越来越力不从心，公众往往怀疑他们只想保护自身的利益，而公众的怀疑其实也很有道理。
All we can do is vote the rascals out, sometimes by voting for candidates whom we would not take seriously in more normal times.	我们只想投票将无赖赶下台，有时甚至因此而投给那些在正常情况下不会受到关注的候选人。
Italian elites are not the only ones in need of being shaken up.	需要重新振作的不仅仅是意大利精英。
But the problem with populism is that it is rarely benign. In the 1930’s, it resulted in violent movements led by dangerous men in uniform.	但问题是民粹主义很少有良性结果，比方说在20世纪30年代导致由身着制服的危险份子领导的暴力运动。
Today’s populists are different.	而今天的民粹主义者则有所不同。
They do not, on the whole, advocate violence.	总体而言他们并不赞成暴力运动。
Some preach that Muslims are destroying Western civilization.	有人宣扬穆斯林正在摧毁西方文明。
Others think that President Barack Obama is a kind of communist out to destroy America.	也有人认为奥巴马总统是要毁掉美国的共产主义份子。
Two types of contemporary populist, however, stand out: the ultra-rich business tycoon and the clown.	于是超级商业大亨和小丑这两类当代民粹主义者脱颖而出。
In the Anglo-Saxon media world, Rupert Murdoch, owner of far too many newspapers, TV stations, and movie studios, is a typical populist tycoon.	盎格鲁－撒克逊世界的传媒大亨鲁珀特·默多克拥有数不清的报纸、电视台和电影制片厂，可谓是民粹主义大亨的典型。
But he never aspired to lead a country.	但他从未有志于担任国家领袖。
Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra did – and still do.	意大利前总理西尔维奥·贝卢斯科尼和泰国前总理他信则有志于此 — — 他们现在仍不改初衷。
Neither the clown nor the tycoon is well suited to being a democratic leader.	民主领袖的合适人选既不是小丑也不是大亨。
The question is which is worse.	问题在于哪个更差劲。
Clowns have always played a role in politics.	小丑一直在政治领域发挥重要作用。
Medieval court jesters were often the only ones who could speak truth to despotic kings.	中世纪的宫廷小丑往往是唯一敢对专制君主讲真话的人。
Today, it is often comedians who claim to speak truth to power – and to the public.	今天，声称对当权者和民众直言不讳的往往是喜剧演员。
In America, liberals turn for political commentary to television comedians like Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, who are now more trusted than traditional news broadcasters.	美国人认为乔恩·斯图尔特和斯蒂芬·科尔伯特等电视喜剧演员比新闻主播的传统政治评论更值得信任。
And clownish right-wing radio talk-show hosts now have more influence on many conservative American voters than the sober journalists of the mainstream media do.	幽默滑稽的右翼电台脱口秀主持人比严肃的主流媒体记者更能影响美国的选民。
A few years ago, a clown named Brozo, with a large red nose and a bright green wig, was Mexico’s most popular political commentator on television, actively courted by all candidates running for national office.	几年前，一位大红鼻头、亮绿假发的Brozo小丑曾是墨西哥最受欢迎的电视政治评论员，并得到所有政界候选人的着意拉拢。
In 1980, the French clown Coluche actually dropped out of the presidential race when one newspaper put his popular support at 16%, causing him to fear that he might influence the result too much.	1980年，法国小丑Coluche其实是主动退出总统竞选，原因是一家报纸统计其民意支持率为16 % ， 这让他担心会过于影响选举结果。
The prototype of modern European populism was the flamboyant Dutch political showman Pim Fortuyn, who was assassinated in 2002 by a fanatical vegan.	2002年遭狂热素食主义者暗杀的夸张的荷兰政治表演者皮姆·佛杜恩是现代欧洲民粹主义的原型。
Fortuyn’s outrageousness was deliberately provocative and always entertaining.	佛杜恩肆无忌惮的故意挑衅常令人忍俊不禁。
His rants against the elites were often confused, but he was funny, which made the old elite politicians look like stuffy old bores – which many of them were.	他对精英阶层的斥责往往令人困惑，但他的滑稽可笑让老派精英政治家看去古板而令人生厌 — — 这也确实是很多人的真实写照。
And now Italy has Beppe Grillo, whose success in the country’s recent election makes him the first professional comedian to lead a major political party in Europe.	现在意大利有了毕普·格里罗，格里罗成功赢得刚刚结束的大选使他成为有史以来领导欧洲主要政党的首位专业喜剧演员。
The thing about clowns, though, is that few have any aspirations to rule their countries.	但小丑的问题在于他们鲜有管理国家的愿望。
Before his death, Fortuyn is said to have been terrified of the prospect of becoming Prime Minister.	据说佛杜恩死前想起担任首相就不寒而栗。
And Grillo cannot even aspire to the job in Italy because of his criminal record.	而格里罗甚至因为有过犯罪记录而不允许在意大利任职。
Clowns mostly seek to provoke, and this can be healthy.	小丑一般都乐于挑衅，而这可以成为他们的优势。
They are less likely than members of the professional political class to allow political calculations to influence their views.	与职业政客相比，他们不大可能让政治算计影响自己的意见。
And, sometimes, they actually say things that are uncomfortable but true, and that need to be said.	而且有时的确会说些有益无害的刺耳的真话。
Political business tycoons, on the other hand, have different ambitions.	另一方面，政界的商业巨子往往另有野心。
They attack the old elites not to shake things up, but to take their power.	他们攻击老派精英并非想寻求改革，而是想抢夺政权。
Promising to spread the riches that they have made for themselves, they exploit the fantasies of those of us who have little and want more.	他们许诺要让更多人像他们那样拥有财富，以此来利用两手空空却满怀希望者的幻觉。
Berlusconi understood the dreams of many Italians very well.	贝卢斯科尼深刻理解许多意大利人的梦想。
His extravagance, clownishness, and even his girls were part of his popular appeal.	他的挥霍无度、反覆无常，甚至就连他的桃色新闻都让他更有吸引力。
In Thailand, the self-made ethnic-Chinese media billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra was especially admired by the rural poor.	在泰国，白手起家的华裔传媒富豪他信·西那瓦尤其受到农村贫困人口的推崇。
Like a beneficent king, he would give them money, and promised to challenge the old elites in Bangkok – the bankers, generals, judges, and even the courtiers surrounding the Thai king.	他会像仁慈的国王那样给他们钱，并承诺挑战曼谷的银行家、将军、法官、甚至是泰国国王臣子等老牌精英。
But tycoons are not natural democrats.	但富豪并不等同于民主人士。
Their main interest is in their own business.	自身的商业利益是他们主要的兴趣点。
And they do not hesitate to undermine an independent press or judiciary when their business interests are threatened.	在商业利益受到威胁时他们会毫不犹豫地破坏新闻和司法独立。
Even though his sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, is now in power, Thaksin is still trying to evade trial in Thai courts on a wide array of financial charges.	即使当权的英拉·西那瓦是自己的妹妹，他信仍试图逃避泰法院对一系列财务指控的审判。
As it happens, Thaksin was overthrown in 2006 by a military coup that was largely backed by the Bangkok elites.	推翻他信的恰好是2006年一次主要由曼谷精英发起的军事政变。
Berlusconi was replaced by a government run by elite technocrats, whose policies had to be approved by European bankers and European Union bureaucrats.	精英技术专家管理的政府接替了贝卢斯科尼，这些人的政策必须得到欧洲银行家和欧盟官僚的核准。
Neither of these responses to populism is likely to boost democracy.	上面提到的民粹主义反应不太可能推动民主。
On the contrary, they make things worse.	相反，情况可能进一步恶化。
What is needed is mainstream politicians who understand and respond to what is fueling popular rage.	我们需要的是了解民众愤怒根源并愿意采取对策的主流政治家。
Paying attention to some of what the clowns are saying might be a good first step.	倾听小丑的心声也许是不错的开始。
	
Why Don’t We Trust Our Leaders?	为什么我们不信任我们的领导人？
OXFORD – In developed democracies today, political leadership is increasingly up for grabs.	牛津—在当今发达民主国家，政治领导权日益变得人人可争而得之。
Voters, clearly tired of the status quo, want change at the top, leaving even major parties’ establishments struggling to install leaders of their choosing.	选民显然已经厌倦了现状，想要顶层发生变化，就连主流政党的建制派都难以安插他们选定的领导人。
In the United Kingdom, Labour Party MPs have been stymied in their efforts to unseat Jeremy Corbyn as leader.	在英国，工党议员罢黜党首杰瑞米·科尔宾（Jeremy Corbyn）的努力严重受阻。
In Japan, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s preferred candidate for Governor of Tokyo, Hiroya Masuda, lost in a landslide to Yuriko Koike.	在日本，执政党自民党中意的东京都知事增田宽也惨败给了小池百合子。
As for the United States, the Republican Party wanted virtually anybody except Donald Trump to win the nomination for the presidency; yet Trump it is.	至于美国，共和党几乎愿意让任何人赢得总统提名人，只要不是唐纳德·特朗普；然而偏偏唐纳德·特朗普赢了。
And while the Democratic Party is being represented by the establishment choice, Hillary Clinton, her competitor, Bernie Sanders, put up a much stronger fight than virtually anyone anticipated.	而民主党尽管仍然由建制派的选择希拉里·克林顿代表，其竞争对手伯尼·桑德斯（Bernie Sanders）斗争之激烈超过了几乎所有人的预料。
The message to the establishment is clear: we don’t trust you anymore.	对建制派来说，信号是明确的：我们再也不信任你们了。
But some of the leaders voters do trust could pose a very real danger – to their supporters, their countries, and the world.	但选民果真信任的一些领导人有可能带来非常切实的危险 — — 对支持者、对国家，也对世界。
Trump – with his admiration of dictators, unabashed racism and sexism, ignorance regarding the issues, and mercurial temperament – stands at the top of this list.	特朗普 — — 及其对独裁者的景仰、毫不遮掩的种族主义和性别歧视、对相关问题的无知以及喜怒无常的习性 — — 首屈一指。
Those who led the British campaign to leave the European Union – such as Conservatives like Boris Johnson (now the country’s foreign secretary) and Nigel Farage, the right-wing populist leader of the UK Independence Party – are similarly disparaged for recklessly jeopardizing the future of the UK and the EU alike.	领导英国脱欧阵营的人 — — 如保守党鲍里斯·约翰逊（Boris Johnson，现任英国外交大臣）和英国独立党的右翼民粹主义领导人尼格尔·法拉奇（Nigel Farage ） — —也因为肆意践踏英国和欧盟的未来而被人唾弃。
If mainstream leaders want to change voters’ minds, they should look carefully at what leadership really means.	如果主流领导人想要改变选民的观点，应该认真想想领导力真正意味着什么。
Here, it is worth recalling the insights of US General George C. Marshall, who contemplated the topic as he worked to rebuild the US military in the 1940s.	在这方面，我们值得回顾美国五星上将乔治·马歇尔的洞见。 他在20世纪40年代重建美军时思考过这个问题。
Marshall argued that leadership is a matter not of rhetoric, but of character.	马歇尔认为，领导力是气质问题，不是修辞问题。
In particular, leaders must display three key qualities to win the trust needed to lead effectively: purpose, impartiality, and competence.	特别是，领导人必须展现三大关键品质才能赢得有效领导所需要的信任：目标（purpose ） 、 公平（impartiality）和胜任力（competence ） 。
Purpose, in his view, meant putting the greater good ahead of one’s own interests.	在马歇尔看来，目标意味着大大超越一个人的自身利益。
This kind of leadership still exists.	这类领导力仍然存在。
A shining example is Jo Cox, the young British MP who was murdered during the Brexit campaign, whose leadership in advocating for the rights of refugees was recognized across party lines.	一个显著的例子是在英国脱欧运动期间遭到杀害的年轻英国议员乔·考克斯（Jo Cox ） ， 他在推进难民权利方面的领导力得到了超越党派界线的承认。
But, in many cases, politics has become a matter of self-promotion – and a race for ratings.	但是，在许多例子中，政治沦为自我推销 — — 以及流品（ratings）的竞赛。
In today’s celebrity culture, politicians must be “personalities.”	在当今名人文化中，政客必须“有个性 ” 。
They campaign like contestants on a reality TV show.	他们的竞选活动好比实时电视秀。
Trump, with his clownish looks and showbiz resume, is probably the ultimate example of this shift.	特朗普形象滑稽，深谙娱乐圈之道，堪称这一转变的终极范例。
(The Huffington Post even decided last summer to publish coverage of Trump’s campaign in its entertainment section.)	（去年夏天 ， 《 霍芬顿邮报》甚至决定将特朗普竞选活动的报道放在娱乐版。 ）
The problem is not only that this can lead to the election of utterly unqualified leaders.	问题不仅在于这可能导致选出完全不够格的领导人。
It is also that, once elected, even qualified leaders can struggle to shed the personal elements of their decision-making, and serve the country impartially instead.	问题还在于，一旦当选，甚至合格的领导人也可能忙于在决策中打上个人烙印，无法做到公平地服务于国家。
The slippery slope is exposed in a memo – recently disclosed as part of the UK’s Chilcot Inquiry – written by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair to former US President George W. Bush in the run-up to the Iraq war.	这一急转直下可以从一份最近作为英国奇尔科特调查（Chilcot Inquiry）的一部分被披露的备忘录中一窥端倪。 该备忘录由英国前首相布莱尔写给美国前总统小布什，时间在伊拉克战争前夕。
The note begins, “I will be with you, whatever.”	备忘录开头写道 ， “ 不管发生���么，我将与你同在 。 ”
He was talking about leading his country into war.	他谈的是领导国家进入战争。
Yet his language suggests that his personal bond with Bush somehow took precedence over his duty as Prime Minister.	但他的语言表明他与小布什的个人关系似乎还在他作为首相的指责之前。
Leading with purpose, rather than personality, is closely related to the impartiality that Marshall thought essential.	以目标而不是个性来领导与马歇尔认为的关键要素 — — 公平密切相关。
Once in office, leaders must act with fairness and candor.	上台后，领导人必须公正坦率地行动。
They must resist the temptation to use official power to benefit themselves, their families, or their cultural identity group, and refuse enticements, however powerful they may be, to offer special access or protection to friends, funders, and lobbyists.	他们必须抵制以权谋私 — — 谋他们自己、他们的家庭或他们的文化认同群体之私 — — 的诱惑，并拒绝为朋友、金主和游说集团提供特殊便利或照顾的诱惑，不管他们多么强大。
Maintaining a high standard of impartiality is not easy, but it is far from impossible.	保持高公平标准绝非易事，但也绝非不可能。
President Pedro Pires of Cape Verde was awarded the 2011 Ibrahim Prize for Achievement in African Leadership, for transforming his country into “a model of democracy, stability, and increased prosperity.”	佛得角总统佩德罗·皮雷（Pedro Pires）2011年获得易卜拉欣非洲领导力成就奖（Ibrahim Prize for Achievement in African Leadership ） ， 原因是他将他的国家改变为“民主、稳定和日益繁荣的典范 ” 。
Pires retired from office without even a house to his name; he worked for the people, not to amass personal wealth.	皮雷离职时名下没有一栋房产；他为人民工作，而不是为敛财工作。
The third criterion for good leadership – competence – is not just a matter of how much knowledge a leader already possesses.	好领导力的第三个标准 — — 胜任力 — — 并不只是具备多少知识那么简单。
As Marshall noted, it also consists in leaders’ capacity to learn from their mistakes and to prepare themselves and those around them for important decisions.	马歇尔指出，胜任力还包括领导人从错误中学习和让自己和周围人群随时做好做出重要决定的能力。
Chilcot’s verdict on Britain’s lack of preparation for the Iraq War and its aftermath is damning in this regard.	奇尔科特调查认定英国对伊拉克战争及其后果准备不足，便是对胜任力的全盘否定。
So is the Brexiteers’ lack of any plan whatsoever for how to proceed after the referendum.	英国脱欧派完全没有处理公投后果的计划亦然。
It is time to revitalize good leadership.	必须重振好领导力。
Voters need to see candidates who show purpose, impartiality, and competence.	选民需要看到候选人如何展现目标、公平和胜任力。
If they don’t, they will continue to vote against the establishment that they believe has failed them – even if it means voting for turmoil in Europe or a reckless narcissist in the US.	如果没有，他们将继续投票反对他们认为辜负了他们的建制派 — — 即使这意味着投票支持欧洲的动乱和美国的鲁莽自恋狂。
	
The Battle for Water	水之战争
NEW YORK – The sharpening international geopolitical competition over natural resources has turned some strategic resources into engines of power struggle.	纽约—自然资源的国际地缘政治竞争愈演愈烈，导致一些战略之源成了实力斗争的推动器。
Transnational water resources have become an especially active source of competition and conflict, triggering a dam-building race and prompting growing calls for the United Nations to recognize water as a key security concern.	跨国水资源已成为特别活跃的竞争和冲突原因，引发了各国的建坝竞赛，越来越多的人呼吁联合国把水看做关键性安全问题。
Water is different from other natural resources.	水和其他自然资源不同。
After all, there are substitutes for many resources, including oil, but none for water.	毕竟，许多资源都能找到替代品，包括石油，但水不行。
Similarly, countries can import fossil fuels, mineral ores, and resources from the biosphere like fish and timber; but they cannot import water, which is essentially local, on a large scale and on a prolonged – much less permanent – basis.	类似地，国家可以进口化石燃料、矿石和其他诸如鱼和木材等生物资源；但国家不能进口水，从根本上说，水是大规模、长时间（尽管远非持久）的立国之本。
Water is heavier than oil, making it very expensive to ship or transport across long distances even by pipeline (which would require large, energy-intensive pumps).	水重于油，这决定了船运或长途输送（即使使用管道进行，而这又需要大型能源密集型水泵）成本极其高昂。
The paradox of water is that it sustains life but can also cause death when it becomes a carrier of deadly microbes or takes the form of a tsunami, flash flood, storm, or hurricane.	水的悖论之处在于，它能维持生命，但也可以造成死亡，如果它成为致命微生物携带者或以海啸、洪水、风暴或飓风形式来临的话。
Many of the greatest natural disasters of our time – including, for example, the Fukushima catastrophe in 2011 – have been water-related.	许多现时代最严重的自然灾害 — — 包括2011年福岛灾难 — — 都和水有关。
Global warming is set to put potable-water supplies under increasing strain – even as oceans rise and the intensity and frequency of storms and other extreme weather events increase.	全球变暖使得饮用水供应日渐捉襟见肘 — — 尽管海平面有所上升，风暴和其他极端天气事件的烈度和频率都在增加。
Rapid economic and demographic expansion has already turned adequate access to potable water into a major issue across large parts of the world.	经济和人口的快速扩张已经让获得充足的饮用水成为世界大部地区的主要问题。
Lifestyle changes, for example, have spurred increasing per capita water consumption, with rising incomes promoting dietary change, for example, especially higher consumption of meat, production of which is ten times more water-intensive, on average, than plant-based calories and proteins.	比如，生活方式的转变刺激了人均水消费量的增加，比如收入上升促使饮食结构发生了改变，特别是肉类消费有所提高，而平均而言，生产肉类卡路里和蛋白质的水密集程度十倍于植物。
Today, the earth’s human population totals slightly more than seven billion, but the livestock population at any given time numbers more than 150 billion.	如今，地球人口总数略高于70亿，但任何时候的牲口数量都超过1500亿。
The direct ecological footprint of the livestock population is larger than that of the human population, with rapidly rising global meat consumption becoming a key driver of water stress by itself.	随着全球肉类消费的迅速增长本身已成为水压力的主要推动因素，牲口数量的直接生态足迹比人类更大。
Political and economic water wars are already being waged in several regions, reflected in dam construction on international rivers and coercive diplomacy or other means to prevent such works.	政治和经济上的谁战争已经在不少地区打响，国际河流上的水坝建设以及用强制外交或其他手段防止这类工程的尝试就是明��。
Consider, for example, the silent water war triggered by Ethiopia’s dam building on the Blue Nile, which has elicited Egyptian threats of covert or overt military reprisals.	比如，埃塞俄比亚在青尼罗河上修建大坝便引起了静悄悄的谁战争，埃及已表示要进行隐蔽或公然的军事报复。
A report reflecting the joint judgment of US intelligence agencies warned last year that the use of water as a weapon of war or a tool of terrorism would become more likely in the next decade in some regions.	去年的一份体现美国情报机构联合判断的报告警告说，未来十年，某些地区极有可能把水作为战争武器或恐怖主义工具。
The InterAction Council, comprising more than 30 former heads of state or government, has called for urgent action to prevent some countries battling severe water shortages from becoming failed states.	由30多位前国家或政府领导人组成的国际行动理事会（InterAction Council）呼吁立刻采取行动防止某些与严重水短缺做着艰苦斗争的国家沦为失败国家。
The US State Department, for its part, has upgraded water to “a central US foreign policy concern.”	美国国务院也将水升格为“美国外交政策核心关注点之一 ” 。
In many countries, inadequate local water availability is increasingly constraining decisions about where to set up new manufacturing facilities and energy plants.	在许多国家，本地水资源不足正在日益制约何处建设新生产设施和发电站的决策。
The World Bank estimates that such constraints are costing China 2.3% of GDP.	世界银行估计，这一制约因素给中国造成的成本相当于GDP的2 % 。
China, however, is not yet in the category of water-stressed states.	但是，中国并非水严重短缺国。
Those that are, stretching from South Korea and India to Egypt and Israel, are paying an even higher price for their water problems.	属于此类的国家 — — 从韩国和印度到埃及和以色列 — — 因为水问题付出的代价更加高昂。
These countries already understand that water is a renewable but finite resource.	这些国家已经认识到，水是一种可再生但有限的资源。
Nature’s water-replenishment capacity is fixed, limiting the world’s usable freshwater resources to about 200,000 cubic kilometers.	大自然的水补充能力是固定的，世界可用淡水资源总量只有200 000立方千米。
But the human population has almost doubled since 1970, while the global economy has grown even faster.	但自1970年以来，人口数量已接近翻番，而全球经济增长速度更加迅速。
Major increases in water demand, however, are being driven not merely by economic and demographic growth, or by the additional energy, manufacturing, and food production to meet rising consumption levels, but also by the fact that the global population is getting fatter.	但是，水需求的大量增加并不仅仅是由经济和人口增长推动的，也不仅仅是由于满足消费水平升高而增加能源、制造品和食品产量导致的，全球人口越来越胖也是原因之一。
The average body mass index (BMI) of humans has been increasing in the post-World War II period, but especially since the 1980’s, with the prevalence of obesity doubling in the past three decades.	人类平均体重指数（BMI）自二战结束以来节节上升，且自20世纪80年代以后加速增长，过去三十年中肥胖率翻了一番。
Heavier citizens make heavier demands on natural resources, especially water and energy.	变重的人民导致了变重的自然资源需求，特别是水和能源需求。
The issue thus is not just about how many mouths there are to feed, but also how much excess body fat there is on the planet.	因此，问题不仅在于有多少张嘴需要喂饱，还在于地球上有多少多于的人体脂肪。
For example, a study published in the British journal BMC Public Health has found that if the rest of the world had the same average body mass index as the US, this would be the equivalent of adding almost one billion people to the global population, greatly exacerbating water stress.	比如，英国《BMC公共卫生 》 （ BMC Public Health）杂志发表的一项研究发现，如果全世界平均体重指数都向美国看齐，其效果相当于全球人口增加近十亿人，会大大增加水压力。
With the era of cheap, bountiful water having been replaced by increasing supply and quality constraints, many investors are beginning to view water as the new oil.	充足、廉价的水时代已经一去不返，取而代之的是日益加剧的供给和质量制约，在这样的局面下，许多投资者开始把水视为新的石油。
The dramatic rise of the bottled-water industry since the 1990’s attests to the increasing commodification of the world’s most critical resource.	20世纪90年代以来，瓶装水行业蓬勃发展，这是世界最关键资源日益商品化的写照。
Not only are water shortages likely to intensify and spread, but consumers also will increasingly have to pay more for their water supply.	不仅水短缺可能恶化和蔓延，消费者也将为水供应支付越来越高的价格。
This double whammy can be mitigated only by innovative water management and conservation, and by developing nontraditional supply sources.	只有水管理和保护方面的创新、开发非传统供给源能减轻这一双重难题。
As in the oil and gas sector – where tapping unconventional sources, such as shale and tar sands, has proved a game changer – the water sector must adopt all unconventional options, including recycling wastewater and desalinating ocean and brackish waters.	和油气行业一样 — — 从页岩和油砂等非常规资源中提取石油已经成为局面改变因素 — — 水行业也必须尽可能采取非常规手段，包括循环利用废水和淡化海水和咸水。
In short, we must focus on addressing our water-supply problems as if our lives depended on it. In fact, they do.	简言之，我们必须把解决我们水供应问题当作生死攸关的大事来关注。
	
The Biology of Luxury	奢侈品中的生物学
PARIS – Despite the global economic crisis, sales of luxury goods are surging worldwide.	巴黎 — — 尽管受到全球经济危机的影响，全球奢侈品的销售仍在激增。
Why?	这究竟是什么原因？
While marketing has contributed to the rise, the luxury market’s robust growth is actually rooted in biology.	尽管营销活动能够部分解释奢侈品消费的上涨，但奢侈品市场的强劲增长究其原因实际要归功于生物学。
Discussions about the structure of human thought have long been dominated by the Enlightenment view that reality is composed of four elements: space, time, matter, and energy.	对人类思想结构的探讨长期以来深受启蒙运动的影响，认为现实由空间、时间、物质和能量等四种要素组成。
But recently, a fifth element, information, has entered the debate.	但不久前，信息作为第五种要素进入了讨论的范畴。
And information, it turns out, is crucial to understanding the fundamental drivers of luxury-goods consumption, and thus to predicting the luxury market’s future.	而且事实证明信息对于理解奢侈品消费的根本动因至关重要，因此可以预测奢侈品市场的未来。
Living organisms communicate, and the information that they exchange shapes their reality.	活体生物相互交流，他们对现实的理解取决于他们所交换的信息。
While animals use colorful displays and complicated behaviors to signal fitness and strength, humans use luxury goods to demonstrate economic health.	动物用缤纷的色彩和复杂的行为来显示健康和力量，而人类则利用奢侈品作为经济状况的标志。
But, more than a symbol, buying luxury goods could indicate future success, owing to the selective advantage that showing off provides.	但购买奢侈品绝不仅仅是一种标志，鉴于炫耀所能提供的选择性优势，它还可能预示着未来的成功。
In nature, competitors perform, and the most compelling, beautiful spectacle wins.	自然界中有竞争才有成就，最引人注目、最美丽者最终胜出。
For most animals, males are the performers.	对多数动物而言，雄性动物更需要竞争。
Male birds, for example, often have brightly colored plumage or intricate appendages, such as the Australian lyrebird’s long tail.	比如雄性鸟类往往拥有色彩艳丽的羽毛或精致复杂的长尾，像澳大利亚琴鸟就拖着长长的尾巴。
As a result, competitive displays have been interpreted as a way to demonstrate fitness to a potential mate.	结果是竞争性炫耀被视为向潜在配偶展示健康的方法。
A bird that survives, despite inconvenient plumage that slows it down or makes it visible to predators, must be fit, and will likely sire a healthy progeny.	漂亮的羽毛吸引掠食者，拖慢奔跑速度，但在羽毛的拖累下仍可存活的鸟类肯定非常健康，而且繁衍出健康的后代的可能性也较大。
Given that females bear the physical burden of offspring, an unobtrusive appearance is more advantageous – and thus more common – in nature.	因为雌性承担着繁衍后代的任务，外表不引人注目似乎是明智的选择 — — 因此在自然界中这种现象也是比较普遍的。
But humans are social creatures with no natural predators, so female competition is more widespread – and demonstrative performance and display are more likely.	但人类是没有天敌的社会动物，因此存在着普遍的女性竞争 — — 也更有可能出现炫耀性的行为和举动。
Indeed, while visual manifestations of wealth are prevalent for both genders, women’s appearance is frequently more vivid (and more closely scrutinized).	其实，虽然炫富在男女两性中均颇为盛行，但女性的表现似乎更加生动（也更受人关注 ） 。
But effective display is costly.	但有效的炫耀行为代价不菲。
Developing complex, vibrant plumage demands significant energy and genetic resources.	长出精致漂亮的羽毛需要耗费可观的能量和遗传资源。
Genes are difficult to maintain, requiring subtle and energy-intensive correcting processes.	基因很难维护，需要耗费大量的能量来进行微妙的调校过程。
Just as writing too fast can cause typographical errors that garble a text, rapid changes to the genome can undermine a species’ integrity.	就像写字过快可能导致错字从而改变字意一样，基因的快速变化也可能破坏物种的完整性。
Likewise, purchasing luxury goods requires substantial financial resources.	同样，购买奢侈品需要雄厚的财力支撑。
This cost dictates the display’s competitive impact.	付出的成本决定炫耀行为的竞争性影响力。
In today’s information-based world, selection is effective only if a striking appearance is obtained at a very high price – and that price is known.	在当今这个以信息为本的世界，只有以极高代价取得醒目的外观才能在选择中产生实际作用 — — 上述代价是人所共知的。
For example, those who use cosmetics known to be expensive often seem healthier, more vibrant, and more attractive than those who do not.	比方说，选用人所共知的昂贵化妆品的人往往看起来更健康、更有活力，比那些不用的人吸引力更强。
This is not the result of efficiency (the most effective cosmetics frequently become pharmaceutical drugs).	这并非效果使然（最有效的化妆品往往是某种药品 ） 。
Rather, it signals a lifestyle that values the preservation of beauty and youth.	相反，它标志着一种重视保持美丽和青春的生活方式。
Cosmetics, like all luxury products, gain influence not from their production, or even their purchase, but from their visibility.	像所有奢侈品一样，化妆品的影响不是源于生产，甚至也不是源于购买，而是源于品牌知名度。
Indeed, an expensive item with no label or identifying characteristics has less competitive impact than a recognized item or brand.	其实，没有标志或识别指征的昂贵物品比为人所知的品牌或物品要少有影响力。
For luxury goods to have any function, society needs information about their cost.	奢侈品要想发挥作用，社会必须了解它的价值。
This has been true to varying degrees throughout history – sometimes resulting in price bubbles.	这有史以来或多或少都是真理 — — 有时还会导致价格泡沫。
False information, such as counterfeit goods, jeopardizes the competition-based selection process.	假冒商品所释放的虚假信息损害了以竞争为本的选择性过程。
Animals commonly use mimicry to capitalize on knowledge – or fear – of another’s strength.	动物往往通过模仿来利用对其他同类力量的了解或恐惧。
By imitating an animal with a well-known protective profile, a weaker one may enjoy selective benefits without the costs.	通过模仿众所周知的具有保护性的动物，弱者可以不付出任何代价就可以享受到选择性收益。
But mimicry’s success in nature depends on the ratio of the original to the ersatz.	但自然界中模拟的成功取决于原版和替代品之间的比例。
If there are too few of the original, the profile loses its significance, and its protective value vanishes.	原版太过稀少的形象就会失去意义，与之相关的保护价值也会大打折扣。
Similarly, nobody would display a symbol of wealth if it were too common.	同样，没有人会去炫耀司空见惯的财富象征。
Therefore, assessing whether luxury goods will maintain their impact, and thus their appeal, requires monitoring the extent of counterfeiting.	因此评估奢侈品是否会保持影响力和吸引力需要控制假冒产品的泛滥程度。
Given that luxury goods provide individuals with a competitive advantage, higher luxury-goods sales could indicate a brighter economic future for a country.	鉴于奢侈品能为个体带来竞争性优势，一个国家奢侈品销售的增长可能预示着更美好的经济未来。
In a time of crisis, countries in which luxury goods play their selective role effectively are the safest bets for productive investment.	危机时期奢侈品有效发挥选择作用的国家是进行生产性投资的理想对象。
	
Why Wolfensohn Mattered	Wolfensohn为何如此重要
At the end of this month, James Wolfensohn’s ten-year tenure as President of the World Bank comes to an end.	这个月底，James Wolfensohn作为世界银行总裁的十年任期即将结束。
Though much remains to be accomplished and consolidated, his achievements as leader of the international development community are noteworthy and provide a strong foundation upon which to build.	尽管还有很多事情尚待完成和巩固，作为国际发展团体领导人，他所取得的成就非凡卓越，为以后的工作奠定了强有力的基础。
Perhaps Wolfensohn’s most important contribution was to clarify the Bank’s mission – to promote growth and eradicate poverty in the developing world – while recognizing the massive scale of that task and the inadequacy of previous approaches.	也许Wolfensohn最为重要的一项贡献就是明确了世界银行的使命所在 — — 促进发展中世界的经济增长、消灭贫穷 — — 同时他们也意识到了这个任务的范围之广以及先前方式的不适当。
At one time, it was thought that since developing countries had less capital than more developed countries, merely supplying more capital would solve their problems.	人们一度以为，由于发达国家比发展中国家拥有更多资本，所以只要提供更多的资本就能够解决发展中国家的问题。
Indeed, this view provided part of the rationale for the World Bank: if a shortage of funds was the problem, clearly a Bank would have to be a key part of the solution.	事实上，这个观点为世界银行提供了一部分理由：如果问题就是基金短缺的话，很明显一个银行就必须得成为解决方案的重要部分。
In the 1980’s, there was a switch from projects to policies – structural adjustments, involving trade liberalization, privatization, and macroeconomic stabilization (typically focusing on prices rather than employment or output.)	上世纪80年代有了一个从计划到政策的转变 — — 涉及到贸易自由化、民营私有化，以及宏观经济的稳定性（比起就业率和产量，尤为关注价格）的结构调整。
But these policies proved neither necessary nor sufficient for growth; the countries of East Asia, which followed different policies, achieved faster growth and were far more successful in poverty reduction.	但是事实证明这些政策对经济增长既非必要也无甚效果；东亚许多国家虽然实施着不同的政策，却取得了更快的经济增长，在减少贫穷方面也成功得多。
Under Wolfensohn’s leadership, the Bank began to look for multifaceted strategies, framed by what he called a Comprehensive Development Framework.	在Wolfensohn的领导下，世界银行开始寻求一种根据他所称的“全球发展框架”来设计的多层面战略。
Many of the links were obvious, but had been given insufficient attention.	许多事物之间的关联显而易见，但却很少有人注意到。
Improved rural productivity or better market access would do little good if roads and harbors were lacking.	如果没有公路和港口，得以提高的农村产量以及更为良好的市场准入就没无甚优势可言。
In a malaria-infested country, mosquito eradication programs can boost production and even increase effective land usage, as acres that were almost uninhabitable become livable.	在疟疾肆虐的国家，灭蚊计划可以提高产量，甚至还可以提高土地有效使用率，使那些不适于人居住的耕地变得可居住。
The returns from education, too, can be increased, if more individuals live longer because of better health care.	如果更多人在健康医疗条件下更加长寿，教育的回报也会增加。
The Bank began to recognize that developing countries differed from more developed countries not just in their lack of resources; there was also a knowledge gap.	世界银行开始意识到发展中国家与发达国家的区别不仅仅在于他们缺少资源，还有知识方面的缺口。
This was particularly important as the world moved into what we call the “knowledge economy.”	当世界迈入我们所谓的“知识经济”时代之际，这点显得尤为重要。
Among the success stories were India and East Asia, which invested heavily not just in primary education, but also in secondary and tertiary education, and especially in technology and science.	印度和东亚取得了成功，他们不仅在初级教育上，也在中等教育和高等教育，尤其是在技术和科学方面大力投资。
This represented a major change in the Bank’s approach to education, which previously focused on primary schooling .	这代表了世界银行对教育的一个重大策略改变，它原来只把重点放在初级学校教育。
Wolfensohn’s campaign against corruption also represented a major change in thinking, a shift from downsizing the state to improving the State.	Wolfensohn发起的抵制腐败运动也代表了思想的一个重大转变，从 减小 国家 规模 转而 改善 国家。
Failed states, it was now acknowledged, were no less an impediment to development than were overbearing states.	人们现在已经意识到，比起那些失败国家，霸道国家对发展的阻碍更大。
The Bank’s 1997 World Development Report reflected this new attempt at finding a balanced role for the state, and showed an understanding of the limitations both of markets and government.	世界银行1997年的《世界银行报告》反映了这一新的尝试，即努力为国家找到平衡角色，并表现出它对市场和政府的局限性的理解。
Under Wolfensohn, the Bank repeatedly stood up to the United States, where both the Clinton and Bush administrations might have preferred a more pliant President.	在Wolfensohn的带领下，世界银行一次次地对抗美国。 克林顿和布什政府也许都会更喜欢一个更为顺从的总裁。
When then US Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summers tried to change the Bank’s Decennial report on poverty – to downgrade concerns about insecurity and empowerment and to focus more narrowly on income – the Bank prevailed.	那时候的美国财政部副部长劳伦斯·桑莫斯（Lawrence Summers）试图改变世界银行对贫困问题所作的十年报告 — — 降低对安全缺乏和赋权问题的关注程度，把焦点更集中地放在收入问题上 — — 但是世界银行胜利了。
When the US tried to suppress the Bank’s call for a more balanced intellectual property regime – one more consonant with the interests of developing countries – the Bank prevailed yet again.	当世界银行呼吁一个更为平衡、更符合发展国家利益的知识产权制度，而当美国试图压制时，世界银行再次胜利了。
Both the Bush administration and the EU would undoubtedly have preferred less criticism of their trade regimes, which have such adverse effects on developing countries.	布什政府和欧盟的贸易体系对发展中国家具有如此不利的影响，他们无疑都希望少一点对他们贸易体系的批评。
It would have been helpful for Bush if the World Bank quietly accepted proposals to finance debt relief for the poorest countries by depleting its reserves, thereby making poor countries pay for the poorest by reducing the Bank’s lending capacity.	如果世界银行平静地接受这个提议，即通过耗尽最贫穷国家的储备来为减免他们的债务融资、然后通过减少世界银行的贷款资本让贫穷国家为最贫穷国家付钱，那对布什会大有帮助。
But it would have been wrong, and the Bank again stood up for the interests of the developing world.	但那将会铸成大错，世界银行再一次为了发展中国家的利益拍案而起。
Changing the relationship between the Bank and the countries seeking its help was no less of an achievement.	把改变世界银行与寻求它帮助的国家之间的关系誉为一大功绩毫不为过。
In the past, the Bank was seen as a purveyor of neoliberal orthodoxy – an approach to development whose credibility had weakened by the time Wolfensohn arrived, and whose standing has eroded further since.	过去，世界银行被认为是通向发展的一种途��� — — 新自由正统学说的传播者。 在Wolfensohn到来之前，新自由正统学说的可信度已经削弱，它的立场自那以后也已经进一步遭到侵蚀。
That orthodoxy often went hand in hand with the national, corporate, and financial interests of the advanced industrial countries, or so it was perceived.	那个正统学说大致就被认为通常是与发达工业国家的民族、公司和金融利益紧密关联的。
Worse, the Bank typically demanded myriad conditions in return for assistance, an approach that undermined democratic processes and domestic ownership of policies, thereby enervating their effectiveness.	更糟的是，世界银行提出许多条件作为它付出资助的回报，这种做法破坏了民主进程和政策的国内所有权，从而降低这些政策的效率。
When Bank research showed that conditionality did not work, the Bank under Wolfensohn moved away from it.	当世界银行的调查显示这种方法行不通的时候，Wolfensohn带领下的世界银行抛弃了这种做法。
The Bank began to realize that on many key issues there were legitimate disagreements among economists about the right course of action.	世界银行开始意识到，经济学家们在许多重要问题上对行动的正确方法存在着诸多合法争论。
Democracy requires active debate about economic policies, not the suppression of discussion or the delegation of decision-making to experts, whether domestic or foreign.	民主需要对经济政策的积极辩论，而不是压制辩论或把决定权授予不管是国内还是国外的专家。
The Bank’s attempt to open the debate was not well received, by either the US Treasury or the IMF, but its influence was undeniable.	世界银行力图打开辩论局面的努力并不被美国财政部或国际货币基金组织所接受，但是它的影响却不可否认。
The Fund, too, began to reduce conditionality, and eventually it began to question the desirability of capital market liberalization, which previously had been central to its agenda.	国际货币基金组织也开始减少条件，并且终于开始质疑人们对资本市场自由化的期待究竟有多高，这原先可是该基金议程的重中之重。
Gradually the Bank came to be perceived, at least in many quarters, as a partner in the joint quest for growth and poverty reduction, not an adversary attempting to promote a Western economic agenda or ideology.	渐渐地，世界银行开始被许多地区看作联合寻求经济增长和减少贫困的合作者，而不再是一个试图推动西方经济议程或意识形态的对手。
Wolfensohn meant it when he said that he wanted to put the country in the driver’s seat, though not everyone within the Bank was as enthusiastic about this (or some of his other) initiatives.	当Wolfensohn说他要让国家做主的时候，他就是这个意思，尽管不是每个世界银行里面的人都对此（或他的其他行动）开端持有热情。
James Wolfensohn presided over the World Bank at a time of enormous change, tumult, and opportunity, an era marked by the end of the Cold War, the postcommunist transition to market economies, and the East Asian – and then global – financial crises.	James Wolfensohn在一个改革巨变的时代坐上了世界银行总裁的座位，这是一个嘈杂骚动、充满机遇的时代，是一个以冷战结束为标志、后共产主义向市场经济转型、全球紧随东亚发生金融危机的时代。
His commitment to those in the developing world has been contagious. He has left an impressive legacy for his successor to take up.	他对这些发生在发展中世界的一切所做的事情感染了众人，他为他的接班者留下了一笔可观的遗产。
	
A Virtuous Cycle for Conservation	良性保护循环
NEW YORK – Poor and rural people around the world rely on plants and animals for shelter, food, income, and medicine.	纽约 — — 世界各地的穷人和农民要靠动植物来获取庇护、食物、收入和药品。
In fact, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 15) on sustainable ecosystems acknowledges many developing societies’ close relationship with nature when it calls for increased “capacity of local communities to pursue sustainable livelihood opportunities.”	事实上，联合国可持续生态系统的可持续发展目标 (SDG 15) 承认许多发展中社会与自然有着密切的联系，并呼吁强化“当地社会追求可持续谋生机会的能力 。 ”
But how is this to be achieved?	但究竟该如何实现这一目标？
The 1975 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) provides a viable framework for reducing poverty while also conserving nature.	1975年野生动植物濒危物种国际贸易公约(CITES)提供了在控制贫困的同时保护自然的可行的架构。
It regulates the harvesting and exchange of more than 35,000 wildlife species across a range of locales.	该公约规定了超过35，000种野生物种在一系列区域的生产和交易行为。
Nature has been described as the “GDP of the poor.”	大自然被誉为“穷人的GDP ” 。
The CITES framework, combined with strong national conservation policies, can simultaneously protect wild species and benefit poor, rural, and indigenous people, by encouraging countries and communities to adopt sound environmental management plans.	野生动植物濒危物种国际贸易公约框架结合强势的国内保护政策，可以通过鼓励国家和社会采纳健全的环境管理计划，同时实现保护野生物种并惠及穷人、农民和土著民众的生活。
For example, under CITES, Andes communities shear the vicuña for its fine wool, which they sell to the luxury fashion industry in other parts of the world.	举例来讲，在野生动植物濒危物种国际贸易公约框架下，安第斯山区的民众剪下小羊驼的细毛向世界其他地方的时尚奢侈行业出售。
Cameroonians collect African cherry bark for export to European pharmaceutical companies.	喀麦隆人收集樱桃树皮出口欧洲制药企业。
And people on the Tibetan Plateau in Bhutan make a living selling caterpillar fungus to the traditional-medicine industry.	而生活在不丹青藏高原上的民众��依靠向传统医药产业售卖虫草来维持生活。
However, outside of CITES, limited guidance is available to ensure that legal trade is sustainable and beneficial to the poor.	但是在野生动植物濒危物种国际贸易公约框架外，确保合法贸易可持续并惠及穷人的指导性原则非常缺乏。
Sustainable trade often depends on poor and rural communities conserving their own resources at the local level.	可持续贸易往往取决于贫困的农村民众在当地实行资源保护。
To see what that looks like, the International Trade Center (ITC) recently examined how people in Southeast Asia sustainably manage the CITES-listed python trade.	为了弄清楚实际状况，国际贸易中心（ITC）不久前对东南亚民众如何管理野生动植物濒危物种国际贸易公约规定的蟒蛇贸易进行了研究。
Python skins are commonly used as raw material in the luxury fashion industry, and ITC surveys of python-skin harvesters, farmers, processors, and exporters in Vietnam and Malaysia found that the trade reinforces livelihood resilience by providing an additional source of income.	蟒蛇皮通常在时尚奢侈品行业被用作原材料，而国际贸易中心对越南和马来西亚蟒蛇皮采集者、农民和出口商的调查显示该贸易通过提供额外收入来源强化了当地民众的抗风险能力。
In Vietnam, an estimated 1,000 households farm and trade pythons, and python harvesting in Malaysia provides incomes for low-skilled, low-income workers during periods when other employment opportunities are either out of season, or simply scarce because of larger economic factors.	在越南，估计有1，000家家庭农场从事蟒蛇的养殖及贸易，而捕蛇在其他就业机会缺乏或因为宏观经济因素十分罕见的情况下为马来西亚的低技能、低收入工人提供了收入。
Researchers found that most of those harvesting pythons implement simple and effective sustainable-management plans, and that this has reduced pressure on wild populations.	研究人员发现大部分蟒蛇捕猎者采用简单而有效的可持续管理计划，且该计划在减轻野生种群压力方面发挥了很大作用。
However, python skins, like many wildlife products, are a commodity, so communities harvesting them are limited in terms of how they can add value to increase returns.	但蟒蛇皮像很多野生动物产品一样是一种商品，因此蟒蛇捕猎群体在如何增加附加值以提高收益方面是受到限制的。
Women in the Peruvian Andes may clean vicuña wool by hand to increase the price it fetches per kilogram by $50, whereas selling a wool-scarf could yield them $150-200; a Malaysian python skin sells for $200, while a python-skin bag could sell for $2,000.	秘鲁安第斯山区女性可以手工清理驼羊毛来换取每公斤增加50美元的收益，而售卖一条羊毛围巾则可以收入150到200美元；一张马来西亚蟒蛇皮售价为二百美元，而一个蟒蛇皮手袋却能以2，000美元的价格出售。
Still, some emerging countries are moving up the value chain and retaining a greater share of returns, as demonstrated by local brands such as Kuna, which markets alpaca and vicuña wool in Peru, and Natura, a Brazilian natural-cosmetic brand.	不过，某些新兴国家正在逐步加入价值链的上游，并因此增加在收益中所占的比例，这方面的例子有售卖羊驼呢和羊驼毛的秘鲁本土品牌Kuna，以及巴西天然化妆品品牌Natura。
The biggest threats to the legal wildlife trade are poaching, smuggling, improper trade permitting, and animal abuse, all of which must be addressed by regulators and rural community stakeholders at the local level.	偷猎、走私、不正当贸易许可和动物虐待是对合法野生动物贸易最大的威胁，所有这些都必须由监管机构和农村群体的利益相关者在当地层面加以解决。
Fortunately, rural communities are already in the best position to protect wildlife, so long as they are motivated to do so.	幸运的是，只要农村群体愿意这样做，他们已经占据了保护野生动物最有利的地位。
In the right circumstances, a virtuous cycle, whereby local producers have a direct interest in protecting wildlife (because they are benefiting from its legal trade) is the best – and sometimes the only – long-term solution to the problem of sustainability.	在适当的环境下，野生动物关系到当地生产者利益（因为他们从野生动物合法贸易中受惠）的良性循环是确保可持续收益的最好 — — 而且有时也是唯一的 — — 长期解决办法。
To help with this, governments can increase rural communities’ resource- and wildlife-use rights so that they can manage and protect their natural resources sustainably.	为实现这一目标，政府可以扩大农民群体对资源及野生动物的使用权，以求使他们能以长远的眼光对自然资源进行管理和保护。
For example, in the 1970s when Peru granted Andean communities the right to use vicuña wool, it saved the vicuña from extinction and created new, long-term income streams for the community.	举例来讲，二十世纪七十年代秘鲁批准安第斯山脉民众有权使用驼羊毛挽救了濒于灭绝的驼羊并为当地民众创造了长期的新的收入流。
Because legal and natural circumstances vary by country and community, we will need similar policy innovations across different sectors.	因为不同国家和群体的法律和自然环境千差万别，在各个部门实现类似的政策创新十分必要。
One promising sector is tourism, which also fits into the CITES framework.	另外一个前景远大的部门是旅游，而且旅游业完全符合野生动植物濒危物种国际贸易公约的架构。
To take one example, since Rwanda began sharing wildlife-tourism revenues with local communities, the mountain-gorilla population has grown.	举一个例子，自从卢旺达开始与当地民众分享野生动物旅游的收入后，山地大猩猩的数量一直在增长。
As we see time and again, when local communities are included, they can become resolute wildlife defenders.	我们一次又一次地看到，只要允许当地民众分享收益，他们可以成为坚定的野生动物捍卫者。
More generally, we should be supporting scientists working on new adaptive-management methods, and the private sector should be given incentives to invest in greater sustainable sourcing and increased supply- and production-chain transparency.	从更广义的角度讲，我们应当支持科学家研究新的适应性管理方法，并激励私营部门投资于扩大可持续采购以及加大供给 — — 还有生产链的透明度。
As the examples above show, conservation and improved livelihoods for the rural poor are feasible, and even mutually reinforcing.	上面的例子表明，在保护的同时改善贫困农民生活不仅可行、甚至是相辅相成的。
With more political will and smart investments, there is no reason we can’t reach the SDGs to both reduce poverty and safeguard wildlife for future generations.	只要强化政治意愿和明智投资，完成可持续发展目标为子孙后代减少贫困和保护野生动物的双重任务是完全可能的。
Last year, the UN passed an historic resolution to tackle illicit wildlife trafficking, recognizing the effectiveness of the CITES legal framework.	去年，联合国通过了一项解决野生动物非法贩卖问题的历史性决议，承认野生动植物濒危物种国际贸易公约合法构架的积极作用。
The resolution calls on the 182 CITES member countries to protect the interests of wildlife as well as to provide tangible benefits for the poor and rural communities.	该决议呼吁野生动植物濒危物种国际贸易公约的182个成员国保护野生动物利益，同时实实在在地惠及贫困人口和农村群众。
We hope that delegates from those member countries meeting at the World Wildlife Conference in South Africa are hearing that call.	我们希望参与世界野生动物大会的来自上述成员国的代表对这一呼吁表示认同。
	
Will Banks and Financial Markets Recover in 2009?	银行和金融市场会在2009年复苏吗？
NEW YORK – Global financial markets in 2008 experienced their worst crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930’s.	纽约—2008年的全球金融市场经历了自从二十世纪三十年代大萧条以来最严重的危机。
Major financial institutions went bust; others were bought up on the cheap or survived only after major bailouts.	有许多大型金融机构破产，另外一些以非常低廉的价格被收购或者在巨额融资后方才得以生存。
Global stock markets fell by more than 50%; interest-rate spreads skyrocketed; a severe liquidity and credit crunch appeared; and many emerging-market economies staggered to the International Monetary Fund for help.	全球股票市场下跌超过50 % ， 利率差急剧扩大，出现了严重的流动性和信用紧缩，还有许多新兴市场经济体不得不向国际货币基金组织求助。
So what lies ahead in 2009?	那么2009年的情况会怎样呢？
Is the worst behind us or ahead of us?	最糟糕的时候是已经过去了还是尚未到来？
To answer these questions, we must understand that a vicious circle of economic contraction and worsening financial conditions is underway.	要回答这些问题，我们必须认识到经济紧缩的恶性循环和持续恶化的财政状况还远未结束。
The United States will certainly experience its worst recession in decades, a deep and protracted contraction lasting about 24 months through the end of 2009.	美国可能会经历几十年来最严重的衰退。 严重并且漫长的经济紧缩可能将持续24个月，直至2009年底。
Moreover, the entire global economy will contract. There will be recession in the euro zone, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Canada, Japan, and the other advanced economies.	此外，整个全球经济也将步入衰退，欧元区、英国、欧洲大陆、加拿大、日本和其他发达经济体都将出现衰退。
There is also a risk of a hard landing for emerging-market economies, as trade, financial, and currency links transmit real and financial shocks to them.	新兴市场经济体存在硬着陆的风险，因为贸易、金融和货币联系将把实际的金融动荡传导给它们。
In the advanced economies, recession had brought back earlier in 2008 fears of 1970’s-style stagflation (a combination of economic stagnation and inflation).	而在发达经济体中，早在2008年初人们就担心衰退会引发二十世纪七十年代出现的那种经济滞胀（经济停滞和通货膨胀的合称 ） 。
But, with aggregate demand falling below growing aggregate supply, slack goods markets will lead to lower inflation as firms’ pricing power is restrained.	但是，由于总需求低于不断增长的总供应量，疲软的商品市场将因为企业的定价能力受到限制而使通货膨胀得以缓解。
Likewise, rising unemployment will control labor costs and wage growth.	同样地，失业率的上升将限制劳动力成本和工资的增长。
These factors, combined with sharply falling commodity prices, will cause inflation in advanced economies to ease toward the 1% level, raising concerns about deflation, not stagflation.	这些因素，加上急剧下降的商品价格，将使发达经济体的通货膨胀下跌到1%的水平，从而使人们担心会出现通货紧缩而不是滞胀。
Deflation is dangerous as it leads to a liquidity trap: nominal policy rates cannot fall below zero, so monetary policy becomes ineffective.	通货紧缩是非常危险的，因为它会导致流动性陷阱：名义政策利率不可能降到零以下，因此货币政策将失去效力。
Falling prices mean that the real cost of capital is high and the real value of nominal debts rise, leading to further declines in consumption and investment – and thus setting in motion a vicious circle in which incomes and jobs are squeezed further, aggravating the fall in demand and prices.	商品价格的不断下降意味着资本的实际成本非常高并且名义债务的实际价值提高了，这将导致消费和投资的进一步下滑，从而引发恶性循环：收入和就业机会进一步萎缩，从而加剧了需求和商品价格的下滑。
As traditional monetary policy becomes ineffective, other unorthodox policies will continue to be used: policies to bail out investors, financial institutions, and borrowers; massive provision of liquidity to banks in order to ease the credit crunch; and even more radical actions to reduce long-term interest rates on government bonds and narrow the spread between market rates and government bonds.	由于传统的货币政策失去效力，其他一些非传统的政策将继续被使用：帮助投资者、金融机构和借贷者摆脱困境，向银行注入巨额的流动资金以缓解信用紧缩，甚至采取更加激进的行动以降低政府债券的长期利率和缩小市场利率与政府债券之间的利差。
Today’s global crisis was triggered by the collapse of the US housing bubble, but it was not caused by it.	今天的全球危机是由美国房地产泡沫的破灭触发的，但是它并不是这场危机的根源。
America’s credit excesses were in residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, credit cards, auto loans, and student loans.	美国的信用发放过度存在于住房抵押、商业抵押、信用卡、车贷和学生贷款中。
There was also excess in the securitized products that converted these debts into toxic financial derivatives; in borrowing by local governments; in financing for leveraged buyouts that should never have occurred; in corporate bonds that will now suffer massive losses in a surge of defaults; in the dangerous and unregulated credit default swap market.	此外将这些债务转化为有害的金融衍生产品的证券化产品、地方政府的借款、向本不该发生的杠杆收购提供的融资、由于违约现象的大量发生现在可能将遭受巨额损失的公司债以及危险并且缺少监管的信用违约掉期市场都存在过多过滥的状况。
Moreover, these pathologies were not confined to the US.	此外，这些病症并不仅仅存在于美国。
There were housing bubbles in many other countries, fueled by excessive cheap lending that did not reflect underlying risks.	其他许多国家因为不能反应潜在风险的低息贷款的泛滥而引发了房地产市场的泡沫。
There was also a commodity bubble and a private equity and hedge funds bubble.	此外还有商品泡沫及私募股权和对冲基金的泡沫。
Indeed, we now see the demise of the shadow banking system, the complex of non-bank financial institutions that looked like banks as they borrowed short term and in liquid ways, leveraged a lot, and invested in longer term and illiquid ways.	事实上，我们现在看到了影子银行系统的倒台以及非银行金融机构的复杂性。 这些金融机构看上去像是银行，因为它们拆借短期资金，然后以流动性方式进行大量的杠杆收购和长期及非流动性的投资。
As a result, the biggest asset and credit bubble in human history is now going bust, with overall credit losses likely to be close to a staggering $2 trillion.	其结果是，人类历史上最大的资产和信用泡沫现在正在破灭，总信用损失很可能将接近2万亿美元。
Thus, unless governments rapidly recapitalize financial institutions, the credit crunch will become even more severe as losses mount faster than recapitalization and banks are forced to contract credit and lending.	在这种情况下，除非各国政府迅速向金融机构注资，随着损失增加的速度快于再资本化的速度以及银行被迫紧缩信用和贷款，信用紧缩将变得更加严重。
Equity prices and other risky assets have fallen sharply from their peaks of late 2007, but there are still significant downside risks.	股权价格和其他风险资产的价格自2007年下半年达到最高点以来急剧下降，但是依然还存在大幅下降的风险。
An emerging consensus suggests that the prices of many risky assets – including equities – have fallen so much that we are at the bottom and a rapid recovery will occur.	有一种共识是鉴于许多风险资产的价格，包括股权价格，已经下降如此之多，市场现在已经处于底部并且将很快出现快速反弹。
But the worst is still ahead of us.	但是最糟糕的时候还远未到来。
In the next few months, the macroeconomic news and earnings/profits reports from around the world will be much worse than expected, putting further downward pressure on prices of risky assets, because equity analysts are still deluding themselves that the economic contraction will be mild and short.	接下来几个月，世界各地出台的宏观经济消息和收入/利润报告将比预想的更糟糕，从而给风险资产价格带来更大的下行压力，因为股权分析师还在自欺欺人地说经济紧缩是温和的并且短暂的。
While the risk of a total systemic financial meltdown has been reduced by the actions of the G-7 and other economies to backstop their financial systems, severe vulnerabilities remain.	尽管发生系统性的金融危机的风险由于七国集团和其他经济体采取行动支持它们的金融体系而被减小了，但是依然存在相当大的脆弱性。
The credit crunch will get worse; deleveraging will continue, as hedge funds and other leveraged players are forced to sell assets into illiquid and distressed markets, thus causing more price falls and driving more insolvent financial institutions out of business.	信用紧缩将变得更严重；去杠杆化的行动将会继续，因为对冲基金和其他杠杆化玩家被迫将资产出售给流动性较差和低迷的市场，从而导致价格进一步下滑以及使更多无力清偿债务的金融机构破产。
A few emerging-market economies will certainly enter a full-blown financial crisis.	一些新兴市场经济体可能将陷入全面爆发的金融危机。
So 2009 will be a painful year of global recession and further financial stresses, losses, and bankruptcies.	因此2009年将会是全球衰退的痛苦一年，财政压力、损失和破产将会进一步加剧。
Only aggressive, coordinated, and effective policy actions by advanced and emerging-market countries can ensure that the global economy recovers in 2010, rather than entering a more protracted period of economic stagnation.	只有发达经济体和新兴市场经济体采取强有力、协同并且有效的政策行动，才能确保全球经济在2010年复苏，而不是进入一个更加漫长的经济滞胀期。
	
Europe’s Unending Berlusconi Problem	欧洲未完的贝卢斯科尼问题
LONDON – Silvio Berlusconi, Italy’s three-time prime minister and the country’s dominant politician for two decades, has now been convicted and sentenced to four years in prison – a sentence since reduced to one year. But few people in Italy – or in Europe – believe that Berlusconi will fade from Italian, or European, politics anytime soon.	伦敦—二十年来意大利最主要政客、三度出任总理的贝卢斯科尼如今被判四年监禁，此后又被减刑为一年。 但在意大利（或者说在欧洲）几乎没人相信贝卢斯科尼会马上从意大利或欧洲政坛上消失。
Just a few days ago, he declared his intention to remain involved in politics, though not to run for prime minister a fourth time.	就在几天前，他宣布无意退出政坛，尽管他也不会追求第四次总理生涯。
Whatever role Berlusconi chooses to play, it is unlikely to be a marginal one.	不管贝卢斯科尼选择扮演什么角色，肯定不会是边缘角色。
He may not wish to be king again, but he certainly can be a kingmaker, owing to his control of Mediaset, Italy’s largest media group.	他可能不再原因充当国王，但显然还可以成为拥立国王的人，因为他是意大利最大传媒集团Mediaset的控制着。
And, given his abysmal popularity ratings, he may decide to play the wild card, embrace a euro-skeptic and anti-government stance, and try to bring down Prime Minister Mario Monti’s technocratic administration.	此外，由于他支持率极低，他可能会选择使出王牌，采取质疑欧元和反对政府的立场，并试图推翻总理蒙蒂的技术官僚政府。
Monti’s government took over from Berlusconi in November 2011, arriving with a clear mandate, and full parliamentary support, to implement the measures needed to restore market confidence and reassure Italy’s eurozone partners and the International Monetary Fund that the country was not going down the path taken by Greece.	蒙蒂政府于2011年11月取代贝卢斯科尼，在议会的一直支持下，以鲜明的立场实施了重振市场信心、保证意大利欧元区成员国地位、向IMF表明意大利不会像希腊那样堕落到底的措施。
At the time of the G-20 summit in Cannes that month, Italy – and Europe – was dangerously close to collapse, with Berlusconi’s government deeply divided about the fiscal measures needed to bring down the country’s debt-service costs.	当月戛纳举行G20峰会时，意大利（以及欧洲）岌岌可危，而贝卢斯科尼政府在减少意大利债务利息支付负担所必须的政策方面分裂为两个阵营。
Domestic political deadlock, and Berlusconi’s inability to engage with Germany and France resulted in spiraling refinancing costs, with the spread relative to German bunds consistently over 500 basis points between July and November 2011.	国内政治僵局，加上再融资成本增加导致贝卢斯科尼无法与德国和法国合作，导致意大利国债相对德国国债的利差在2011年7月—11月间一直保持在500个基点以上。
The Monti government has restored market confidence and Italy’s international credibility.	蒙蒂政府已经重塑了市场信心和意大利的国际信誉。
But the overall picture remains fragile.	但整体状况依然脆弱。
The interest-rate spread has stabilized around a more manageable 300 basis points, but is still higher than it was three years ago.	利差稳定在较易控制的300个基点的水平，但仍比三年前要高。
In addition, Italy’s economic outlook remains highly uncertain.	此外，意大利经济前景仍高度不确定。
Indeed, the modest economic recovery that should benefit many countries in 2013 seems to be eluding Italy.	事实上，预计在2013年给众多国家带来好处的温和经济复苏似乎不会光临意大利。
According to the IMF, the economy will remain in recession next year, and, though the rate of contraction will be less severe than in 2012 (-0.7% in 2013, compared to -2.3% this year), the unemployment rate is expected to rise further, from 10.6% to 11.1%.	根据IMF的预测，意大利经济明年将继续衰退，尽管衰退不会像2012年那样严重（2013年经济增长将为-0.7 % ， 而今年将为-2.3 % ） ，而失业率将进一步从10.6%升至11.1 % 。
More needs to be done in order to support economic growth in the short term, improve the country’s fiscal position in the medium term, and implement the structural reforms needed to make the Italian economy more robust and internationally competitive in the long term.	意大利需要采取进一步行动以支持短期经济增长、改善中期财政状况，并采取结构性改革以保证意大利经济在长期更加稳健和具有国际竞争力。
Italy is ranked 43rd in the World Economic Forum’s global competitiveness index, well below the main eurozone countries, owing to lack of investment – especially in human capital – and structural rigidities that have constrained growth for many years.	意大利在经合组织全球竞争力排名中名列第43，与主要欧元区国家相去甚远，这主要是由于投资不足（特别是人力资本方面的投资）以及约束增长多年的结构性僵化造成的。
The answer to Italy’s economic problems is not, as Berlusconi advocates, an exit from the eurozone and a return to the flexibility of its own currency, which in the past allowed policymakers to boost competitiveness through irresponsible devaluations.	意大利经济问题的答案并不是如贝卢斯科尼所鼓吹的退出欧元区、回归更加灵活的本国货币等在过去能让政客用不负责任的贬值提振竞争力的老办法。
Italy needs to learn how to live with the euro and within the eurozone, which means adopting policies that ensure that productivity growth and innovation, not currency devaluation, are the main drivers of competitiveness.	意大利需要学习如何与欧元共存，如何在欧元区内生存，这意味着采取保证生产率增长和创新而不是货币贬值的政策，这才是提振竞争力的主要动力。
A stable, competent, and responsible government with a comfortable parliamentary majority is essential to continue what Monti’s government has initiated.	稳定、胜任而负责的政府以及一个满意的议会多数是维持蒙蒂政府措施的关键。
While the odds still favor a relatively smooth transition, many uncertainties could derail the reform process.	尽管相对平稳的转型仍是最可能发生的情景，但不确定性仍可能妨碍改革过程。
In particular, whether Italy will be able to move beyond technocratic politics to a “normal” government remains the outstanding question both at home and for the other eurozone member states.	特别是，意大利是否能够打破官僚政治的藩篱，回到“正常”政府上来仍是其国内和其他欧元区成员国关注的悬而未决的问题。
From this perspective, what Berlusconi advocates for Italy, and the consequences of his agenda for the eurozone, is not good news.	从这个角度看，贝卢斯科尼建议意大利做的，以及他的欧元区日程表的后果，对意大利来说都不是好消息。
Any hint that the country may be locked again in parliamentary inertia, as in the final months of Berlusconi’s last government, would push the markets to question the credibility of Italy’s fiscal-consolidation plan, jeopardizing the country’s ability to refinance its debt.	意大利可能再次陷入贝卢斯科尼上届政府最后几个月的议会僵局的风险将使市场质疑意大利财政整合计划的可信度，妨碍意大利再融资其债务的能力。
That debt is the largest in the eurozone – at roughly €2 trillion ($2.6 trillion), or 120% of the country’s GDP – which means that Italy can be helped, but not rescued.	而这笔债务是欧元区中最大的一笔 — — 大约2万亿欧元，或相当于其GDP的120 % — —这意味着意大利只能被帮助，不能被救助。
With potential instability looming, Monti should ensure that Italy is not defenseless in the event of another round of market instability.	在潜在的动荡面前，蒙蒂应该确保意大利不会再新一轮市场动荡前束手无策。
Unlike some months ago, now the European Central Bank can intervene and buy troubled countries’ debt.	与几个月前不同，如今欧洲央行可以干预并购买受困国的债务。
But this mechanism can be activated only by formal request.	但这一机制被激活是有正式条件的。
Italy should follow this route without delay.	意大利应该毫不迟疑地朝这个方向前进。
It is better to have a powerful weapon that may gather dust than to be unarmed in a time of need.	在这个节骨眼上，宁可获得有力武器而任其蒙尘，也不应该赤手空拳。
	
Will Britain Choose Irrelevance?	英国会选择边缘化吗？
LONDON – When voters in the United Kingdom go to the polls on June 23 to decide whether their country should leave the European Union, the issues they will have to reckon with will include the impact of their decision on unemployment, trade flows, and the stability of financial markets.	伦敦—6月23日，当英国选民来到投票箱前，决定是否要让祖国脱离欧元区时，他们必须考虑的一个问题是他们的决定对失业、贸易流和金融市场稳定的影响。
But there are other less quantifiable considerations that must also be weighed in the balance.	但其他不太能够量化的考虑也必须进行权衡。
The economic arguments against a British exit from the EU – or Brexit – have been well rehearsed.	反对英国退出欧盟（简称英国退出）的经济理由早已耳熟能详。
Many have suggested that if the UK were to leave, manufacturers would secure continued access to the European market by fleeing across the English Channel, costing the country millions of jobs.	许多人认为，如果英国脱离欧盟，制造业必须越过英吉利海峡进入欧洲市场，导致英国损失数百万工作岗位。
Similarly, withdrawal from the EU risks undermining London’s position as a global financial center, which depends on the city’s integration into European markets.	类似地，退出欧盟有可能破坏伦敦的全球金融中心地位，这一地位依赖英国融入欧洲市场。
Trade agreements, too, would have to be renegotiated in the wake of a Brexit.	贸易协定也必须在英国退出后重新谈判。
Another area of concern for many voters regards the UK’s sovereignty – the idea that independent countries should have ultimate decision-making authority over what happens within their borders.	对许多选民来说，另一个忧虑是英国的主权 — — 即独立国家对于发生在其疆界内的事物应该拥有最终决定权的思想。
Membership in the EU sometimes requires ceding control to a complex web of often-inefficient Brussels-based supranational institutions.	欧盟成员国地位有时需要向位于布鲁塞尔，常常效率低下的复杂的超国家机构网络让渡一些控制权。
I hold a doctorate in economics and work with businesses whose employees and operations benefit from the UK’s membership in the EU.	我拥有经济学博士学位，并与一些员工和经营活动因为英国的欧盟成员国地位而收益的企业合作。
I also have a pronounced disdain for red tape and inefficiency.	我也相当鄙视官样文章和低效率。
And yet I do not believe that economic considerations or concerns about sovereignty offer compelling arguments for Brexit.	但我并不认为经济考虑或对主权的担忧是英国退出问题最主要的原因。
Much more important is the potential impact of such a decision on the UK’s global standing.	比这些因素重要得多的是这一决定对英国全球地位的潜在影响。
Membership in a European community of 500 million people provides the UK with considerable influence over geopolitics and the global economy.	加入到拥有5亿人口的欧洲社会能让英国拥有对地缘政治和全球经济的可观的影响力。
As the world becomes ever more daunting and complex, maintaining that influence is clearly in the country’s interest.	随着世界变得越来越可怕和复杂，保持这一影响力显然符合英国的利益。
The referendum campaign is playing out against a global economic and political backdrop that is nothing if not foreboding.	全民公决是在一个全球经济和政治背景下进行的，这一背景带来了不祥的预兆。
The International Monetary Fund has warned that global growth is unlikely to return to the levels that it attained before the 2008 financial crisis.	国际货币基金组织（IMF）警告全球经济不可能回到2008年金融危机前的水平。
Indeed, the global consulting firm McKinsey predicts that global growth rates during the next 50 years will be half of what they were over the previous five decades.	事实上，全球咨询公司麦肯锡预测，未来50年全球增长率将只有此前五十年的一半。
Meanwhile, Martin Dempsey, a retired army general and former Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said that the world has entered the most dangerous period he has ever witnessed.	与此同时，退休陆军上将、前美国参谋长联合会议主席马丁·邓普西（Martin Dempsey）说，世界已经进入了他所见过的最危险的时期。
Developing countries are home to roughly 90% of the world’s population, and some two-thirds of their residents are younger than 25.	发展中国家占据了世界人口的90%左右，并且其中三分之二的居民年龄不到25岁。
Stagnant growth or shrinking output in many emerging economies has serious consequences.	许多新兴经济体的增长停滞或产出萎缩产生了严重后果。
The UK’s Overseas Development Institute predicts that by 2025, roughly 80% of the world’s poor will live in fragile states.	英国海外发展研究所（Overseas Development Institute）预测，到2025年，80%的世界人口将生活在脆弱国家。
Job-eroding technological advances, worsening income inequality, demographic shifts, dwindling natural resources, and environmental depletion are adding even more straws to the camel’s back.	减少工作岗位的技术进步、恶化的收入不平等、人口变化、日益遭到破坏的自然资源和环境耗竭给骆驼压上了更多的稻草。
The world is already undergoing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II, with some 60 million people having been driven from their homes.	世界正在经历二战结束以来最严重的难民危机，大约6,000万人被迫流离失所。
The mounting instability will only exacerbate the problem.	日益严重的动荡将进一步恶化问题。
Leaving the EU will not shield the UK from the vagaries of the global economy.	脱离欧盟无法将英国隔离在全球经济的变幻莫测之外。
It will only deprive the country of a leading voice in shaping the response to new and existing challenges.	这样将剥夺英国在制定新旧挑战应对方案上的领导权。
The UK is far better placed to influence the global policy agenda from inside the EU than from outside it.	对英国来说，从欧盟内部影响全球政策日程比从外部要有利得多。
To be sure, leaving the EU would not strip the UK of its historical prominence in international organizations – most notably its permanent membership of the United Nations’ Security Council.	诚然，脱离欧盟不会影响欧盟在国际组织中的历史主导地位 — — 最显著的便是联合国安理会常任理事国地位。
But a non-European Britain would be less likely to secure the same standing and influence in whatever institutions emerge in the years ahead.	但不属于欧洲的英国在今后新���现的任何机构中拥有同样地位和影响力的可能性降低了。
Within the EU, the UK is a critical part of an influential economic and political bloc with undeniable heft.	在欧盟内部，英国是影响力毋庸置疑的经济和政治集团的关键部分。
Amplified by the EU, its voice can influence world events, providing the country with what the British like to describe as an ability to punch above its weight.	通过欧盟的放大，英国的声音能够左右世界事件，给英国带来英国人常说的超越国家实力的能力。
Should the UK leave, however, its influence would be limited to its true size on the global stage: a relatively small country with limited economic and political power.	但是，如果英国脱离欧盟，其影响力将限于其在世界舞台上真正规模：一个相对较小的、经济和政治实力有限的国家。
As British voters prepare to cast their ballots, they should weigh carefully the consequences of international irrelevance.	在英国选民准备投票之际，他们应该仔细掂量国际边缘化的后果。
	
Will Cap-and-Trade Incite Protectionism?	“总量管制和排放交易 ” （ CAP-AND-TRADE）制度会引发贸易保护主义么？
CAMBRIDGE ­– There is a serious danger that the international adoption of cap-and-trade legislation to limit carbon-dioxide emissions will trigger a new round of protectionist measures.	剑桥 — — 目前，关于“总量管制和排放交易”在国际间被广泛接受，很有可能引发新一轮的贸易保护主义。 而且在近期乃至将来对经济造成非常不好的影响。
While aimed at reducing long-term environmental damage, cap-and-trade policies could produce significant harmful economic effects in the near term that would continue into the future.	“总量管制和排放交易”是为了限制二氧化碳的排放而制定的一项立法，目的是限制碳排放量对环境的长期危害。
Scientific evidence appears to indicate that the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels (primarily coal, oil, and natural gas) – mainly in electricity production, transportation, and various industrial processes – contributes to gradual global warming, with long-term adverse effects on living conditions around the world.	科学证据表明：由于燃料化石（主要是煤，石油和天然气 ） — —主要是用于发电，运输和各种工业化等 — — 在空气中的大量燃烧，使得二氧化碳在大气层中的含量不断升高，迫使全球气候变暖，由此威胁到我们生活的环境。
It is with this in mind that representatives of more than 150 countries are scheduled to meet in Copenhagen in December to discuss ways to reduce CO2 emissions.	因此，今年12月，全球150多个国家的代表将在哥本哈根聚集，共同讨论如何减少二氧化碳的排放量问题。
A common suggestion is to impose a tax on all CO2 emissions, which would be levied on companies that emit CO2 in production, or that sell products like gasoline that cause CO2 emissions when used.	如何解决这一难题呢？ 目前一种普遍的解决方案是对于二氧化碳的排放实施税收管制，也就是说针对那些由于生产环节而产生二氧化碳的企业，或是产品本身（例如汽油）的使用导致二氧化碳排放的企业增加税收。
Such a tax would cause electricity companies and industrial firms to adopt techniques that reduce their CO2 emissions, as long as the cost of doing so is less than the tax that they would otherwise have to pay.	目的是使得电力公司和其他工业企业改进工艺，减少二氧化碳的排放，只要是税金的数额高于工业改造的成本，他们就会选择后者。
The higher cost of production incurred to reduce emissions – and of any emissions tax still due – would, of course, be included in the price charged to consumers.	如果对生产企业加增赋税 — — 目前这些税种还没有开始实施 — — 必然的结果就是，这些负担将会被转嫁到消费者头上。
Consumers would respond to the tax-induced increase in the cost of the emissions-intensive products by reducing their consumption of those goods and services in favor of goods and services that create smaller amounts of CO2 emissions.	而由于产品价格的升高，消费者自然也会因此减少购买这些产品，转而购买那些排放二氧化碳较少的产品和服务。
A carbon tax causes each firm and household to respond to the same cost of adding CO2 to the atmosphere.	同样的，每一个家庭和公司都会受到排放税的影响。
That uniform individual cost incentive allows total CO2 to be reduced at a lower total cost than would be achieved by a variety of administrative requirements, such as automobile mileage standards, production technology standards (e.g., minimum renewable fuel inputs in electricity generation), etc.	政府可以通过行政的手段，迫使个人消费者减少二氧化碳的排放量，这如同汽车里程标准和其他一些产品技术标准（例如，在电动机中，有最小可再生汽油消耗量的标准。 ）一样。
Yet we do not see carbon taxes being adopted.	然而，目前我们并没有看到碳附加税的出台。
Although governments levy taxes on gasoline, they are reluctant to impose a general carbon tax because of public opposition to any form of taxation.	虽然汽油有附加税，考虑到公众的反对态度，政府不大可能采用一般碳附加税的做法。
Governments have therefore focused on a cap-and-trade system as a way of increasing the cost of CO2-intensive products without explicitly imposing a tax.	于是，政府采用了“总量管制和排放交易”系统来提高和二氧化碳相关产品的成本，以此来达到收税的一样的目的。
In a cap-and-trade system, the government sets total allowable national emissions of CO2 per year and requires any firm that causes CO2 emissions to have a permit per ton of CO2 emitted.	在“总量管制和排放交易”系统中，政府对国家每年可以排放二氧化碳的总量给出一个标准，对那些排放二氧化碳的公司，要求他们领取一定的执照。
If the government sells these permits in an auction, the price of the permit would be a cost to the firm in the same way as a carbon tax – and with the same resulting increases in consumer prices.	政府再对这些牌照进行竞价拍卖，如此一来，这些公司将会增加一定的成本，就如同碳税收一样 — — 变相提高了产品的价格。
The cap-and-trade system thus imposes a carbon tax without having to admit that it is really a tax.	“总量管制和排放交易”系统实际上就相当于一种税收，只是不这么称呼而已。
A cap-and-trade system can cause serious risks to international trade.	“总量管制和排放交易”系统对国际贸易中有着非常严重的危害。
Even if every country has a cap-and-trade system and all aim at the same relative reduction in national CO2 emissions, the resulting permit prices will differ because of national differences in initial CO2 levels and in domestic production characteristics.	即使为了减少本国的碳排放量，世界上每个国家都有采取“总量管制和排放交易”系统。
Because the price of the CO2 permits in a country is reflected in the prices of its products, the cap-and-trade system affects its international competitiveness.	但由于各个国家的不同的二氧化碳水平排放水平以及国内产品上的差异性，每个国家的碳排放的执照价格就会不同， 由此影响到相对应产品的价格，从而影响到该产品在国际上的竞争力。
When the permit prices become large enough to have a significant effect on CO2 emissions, there will be political pressure to introduce tariffs on imports that offset the advantage of countries with low permit prices.	当执照的价格对二氧化碳的排放量影响力足够大时，国内就会有政治上的呼吁，要求对那些牌照费用较低国家的产品增收进口关税。
Such offsetting tariffs would have to differ among products (being higher on more CO2-intensive products) and among countries (being higher for countries with low permit prices).	这些关税也会因产品而异（排放二氧化碳越多的产品征收税额会越高 ） 。
Such a system of complex differential tariffs is just the kind of protectionism that governments have been working to eliminate since the start of the GATT process more than 50 years ago.	这种复杂的税收体制其实就是各国政府的一种贸易保护主义措施，这种贸易保护主义早在50年前的关税贸易总协定中就已经被禁止使用。
Worse still, cap-and-trade systems in practice do not rely solely on auctions to distribute the emissions permits.	更为糟糕的是 ， “ 总量管制和排放交易”系统在实际操作中不仅仅是通过竞价拍卖来发放牌照。
The plan working its way through the United States Congress (the Waxman-Markey bill) would initially give away 85% of the permits, impose a complex set of regulatory policies, and allow companies to buy CO2 offsets (e.g., by paying for the planting of trees) instead of reducing their emissions or buying permits.	例如，美国国会通过实行一个复杂的立法政策，要求相关企业通过抵消二氧化碳的排放量（例如，栽种一定数量的树木的做法 ） ， 来获得85%的排放执照。 如此复杂的系统将无法和其他国家的排放执照的费用加以比较。
Such complexities make it impossible to compare the impact of CO2 policies among countries, which in turn would invite those who want to protect domestic jobs to argue for higher tariff levels.	这样就会给那些想要保护本国就业机会的国家提供一定的借口，实施对外来产品的关税。
There is no easy answer to this problem.	看来，问题的解决远没有那么简单。
But before rushing to impose tariffs, it is important to remember that cap-and-trade policies would not be the only government source of differences in competitiveness.	在忙于推出关税之前，我们还应该知道，除了“总量管制和排放交易”系统，各国政府还有其他手段来提高本国的竞争力。
Better roads, ports, and even schools all contribute to a country’s competitiveness.	完善本国的公路，港口，甚至是建立较好的学校都能增加一个国家的竞争力。
No one attempts to use tariffs to balance those government-created differences in competitiveness, and there should be no such attempts if a cap-and-trade system is introduced.	我们不愿意看到政府用关税手段来影响产品的国际竞争力，这同样也违背了“总量管制和排放交易”系统的初衷。
If an international agreement to impose a cap-and-trade scheme is adopted in Copenhagen, the countries there should agree as well that there will be no attempt to introduce offsetting tariffs that would ultimately threaten our global system of free trade.	如果在本次哥本哈根会议上 ， “ 总量管制和排放交易”系统能够得以通过。 与会的国家还应该保证不会采用关税壁垒的手段，因为这将关乎到全球自由贸易系统的生死存亡。
	
Will China “Lose” the 2008 Olympics?	中国将“失去”2008年奥运会吗？
When the International Olympic Committee awarded Beijing the 2008 Summer Games in July 2001, the announcement ignited wild celebrations across the country.	当国际奥委会在2001年7月将2008年夏季奥运会的主办权授予北京时，整个国家都陷入欢腾之中。
The Chinese Communist Party hoped to use the Games to showcase the country’s emergence as a dynamic, modern nation.	中国共产党希望用这次奥运会来展示这个国家已经成长为一个充满活力、现代化的国家。
But as China’s leaders begin final preparations for the Games next August, they may be wondering if hosting the event was such a good idea after all.	但是当中国的领导人正在为明年八月举办的奥运会作最后的准备时，他们也许正怀疑举办这样一次运动会到底是不是一个那么美妙的主意。
They have significant reasons for doubt.	他们很有理由要对此表示怀疑。
China’s senior leaders always closely monitor spontaneous public expressions of nationalist fervor, fearful that shifting winds might blow an unwelcome storm in their direction.	中国的高层领导人总是密切地监视公众自发表现出的民族主义狂热，担心转动的风向也许会发起针对他们的不受欢迎的风暴。
Of course what they hope is that the Games will channel these energies toward national solidarity, which will allow the leadership to deliver its people a moment of achievement and patriotic glory.	他们希望的当然是奥运会能把这些能量引向民族的团结，从而使领导层能够给它的人民带去一个充满成就和爱国主义荣耀的时刻。
But the Olympics will also bring intense international scrutiny of China’s weaknesses at a delicate moment in the country’s development.	但是奥运会也会带来国际社会对正处于国家发展微妙阶段的中国的弱点的密切观察。
The world already knows of China’s success and its attractiveness as a destination for foreign investment, but few outsiders have seen firsthand the steep price the country is paying for its new prosperity.	世界已经了解到了中国的成功以及它对外商投资的吸引力，但是很少有外人能够亲眼看到这个国家为它新的繁荣所付出的高昂代价。
The most obvious signs of that cost flow through the country’s waterways and contaminate its air.	最明显的迹象是流动在这个国家的河道和弥漫在空气中的代价。
Runaway growth and development have left about 70% of China’s lakes and rivers severely polluted, many unfit for human use of any kind.	快速的经济增长使中国大约70%的河流遭到了严重的污染，许多已经不适合人类进行任何形式的使用了。
Indeed, nearly a half-billion Chinese lack access to clean drinking water, and the number of terminally polluted rivers and lakes grows daily.	事实上，几乎有近五亿中国人无法获得干净的饮用水，而遭到严重污染的江河湖泊的数量每天都在增加。
But air quality will prove the more embarrassing problem next August.	但是空气质量将会在明年八月被证明是一个更令人尴尬的难题。
Television coverage of athletes gasping for breath will hardly provide Beijing with the signature Olympic image it had in mind, and growing international anxiety over climate change and other environmental hazards will ensure that such issues receive considerable media coverage.	运动员呼吸苦难的电视画面很难让北京获得它心目中想留给人们的奥运会形象，而国际社会对气候变化及其他环境灾害的日益关注肯定会使媒体大量地关注这些问题。
There is also the risk that the Games will become a political circus, as the international spotlight generates irresistible opportunities for public protest.	同时奥运会还存在成为一场政治马戏的危险，因为国际社会对奥运会的关注给公众抗议活动带来了令人难以拒绝的机会。
The Chinese leadership has demonstrated many times that it can quell domestic dissent, but the unique scale of the Olympics will require round-the-clock vigilance.	中国的领导层已经多次展示了它压制国内不满声音的能力，但是像奥运会这样大规模的盛会需要一天二十四小时不停地保持警戒。
Activists with grievances over Tibet, Taiwan, Burma, Darfur, and dozens of other political, environmental, and human-rights issues are already making plans.	对西藏、台湾、缅甸、达尔富尔和许多其他政治、环境和人权问题感到不满的激进分子已经在进行筹划了。
Is China ready for Greenpeace, Human Rights in China, Amnesty International, and Falun Gong supporters to take to the streets, with thousands of foreign journalists hungry for stories and asking questions that the authorities are unaccustomed to answering?	中国已经准备好如何应对绿色和平组织、人权在中国、国际特赦组织和法轮功的支持者走上街头，还有数千名渴望寻找故事素材并且会问一些当局不习惯回答的问题的外国记者了吗？
Even if police are able to maintain order in Beijing, can they extend that control across the country?	即便警察能够维持北京的秩序，但是他们能够控制整个国家吗？
Can they manage the flow of information and ideas through the blogosphere as online activists open yet another front in their battle for free information?	他们能够限制通过网志空间传播的信息和思想吗？ 因为网上的激进分子已经开辟了他们为信息自由而战的另一条战线。
What we do know that Chinese officials have never faced a challenge of this scale with such a potential to both win and lose face.	我们所知道的是中国的官员而从来没有这样大规模的可能使他们在赢得脸面的同时也失去脸面的挑战。
The Games will generate significant foreign-policy risks as well.	奥运会同时也会带来严重的外交政策风险。
In Taiwan, outgoing President Chen Shui-bian is stirring the independence pot, knowing that the Olympic spotlight will limit Beijing’s ability to respond forcefully.	台湾即将离任的总统陈水扁正在掀起独立运动，因为他知道对奥运会的关注会限制北京做出强硬反应的能力。
He has already proposed a popular referendum on Taiwanese membership in the United Nations.	他已经提出要在台湾加入联合国的问题进行全民公投。
China’s influence within the UN would prevent such a move even if Taiwan voted yes, but an international confrontation is the last thing China wants coinciding with the Olympics.	即便台湾人表决同意加入联合国，中国在联合国内的影响力也会阻止这样的行动，但是国际对抗是中国在奥运会举办期间最不想发生的事情。
Then there is the matter of how the Games will be received in the West.	另外还有西方国家如何接受奥运会的问题。
Since 2001, China has increasingly become the focal point of much anxiety in the developed world.	自从2001年以来，中国越来越成为发达国家严重忧虑的焦点。
Huge bilateral trade deficits, accusations that China keeps its currency undervalued, and a rash of defective and dangerous Chinese-made exports have fueled a protectionist backlash in the United States and Europe.	巨额的双边贸易赤字、对中国让货币保持在低水平的谴责、中国出口的产品一再发生质量低劣以及危险性的问题遭到了美国和欧洲的保护主义者的强烈抗议。
Amid bitter election-year debates over Iraq and Iran, and a souring economic outlook, Americans may be in no mood for the triumphalist pageantry of a new rising power on display in Beijing.	在选举年对伊拉克和伊朗问题进行的激烈辩论中，以及经济前景的暗淡使美国人也许没有心思关注在北京上演的一个新崛起的大国胜利主义者的盛大场面。
Will China’s uneasy Asian neighbors be any more receptive?	中国那些感到不安的亚洲邻国会更接受这场盛会吗？
International criticism is sure to follow if something, anything, goes wrong during the Games, especially if it involves the suppression of dissent and is vectored around the world via 24-hour cable television and the Internet.	如果在奥运会期间有什么事或者任何事出了差错，国际的批评家可能会穷追不舍，尤其是如果它压制不满的声音并且通过有线电视和因特网将消息24小时不间断地传播到整个世界的话。
China has changed since it “won” the 2008 games seven years ago.	自从七年前“赢得”2008年奥运会的举办权以来中国已经发生了巨大的变化。
The Party leadership has grown more self-assured in its growing international role, but its ability to manage the pace of change at home has become more uncertain.	共产党的领导层因为它在国际社会越来越高的地位而变得更加自信，但是它是否能跟上国内所发生的变化的步伐也变得更加不确定了。
In 2001, then President Jiang Zemin hoped the Games would herald China’s arrival as an industrialized power.	在2001年时，当时的国家主席江泽民希望奥运会能够展现中国已经成为一个工业化强国。
But his successor, Hu Jintao, has focused on the damage that has come from unrestrained growth.	但是他的继任者胡锦涛则把注意力集中在无节制的发展所造成的危害上。
He and Premier Wen Jiabao have also championed a more “harmonious” society, because they understand that the growing wealth gap, social tensions, environmental and public health problems, and the Party’s tenuous relationship with China’s less advantaged people can no longer be neglected.	胡锦涛和总理温家宝还提倡更加“和谐”的社会，因为他们认识到越拉越大的贫富差距、社会矛盾、环境和公共健康问题以及党与中国的劣势人群的紧张关系都是不能够再忽视的问题。
As China’s leaders scramble to address these challenges, will they still relish the idea of providing an international audience with front-row seats?	当中国的领导人艰难地应对这些挑战时，他们还有心思为国际社会的观众提供前排的座位吗？
How they look back on the Games once the confetti is swept from the streets is far from certain.	我们还不知道等到大街上的彩纸屑散去时他们会怎样回头看这届奥运会。
	
Will China’s Capitalist Revolution Turn Democratic	中国的资本主义革命能否转变为民主化
Communist China has experienced a monumental capitalist revolution in the last two decades, with an economy that is now six times bigger than it was 20 years ago.	过去二十年中，共产中国经历了资本主义革命巨变，其现今的经济总量是二十年前的6倍。
A minor player in the global economy in the 1980’s, China today is the world’s third largest trading power.	二十世纪八十年代中国在全球经济中还微不足道，如今，它已经是世界第三大贸易大国。
But if these stunning economic statistics make you think that so much capitalist development must also have brought more democracy to China, think again.	但是，如果这些耀人的经济数据让你以为如此多的资本主义发展必定给中国带来了更多的民主，那你就需要三思了。
Most Westerners believe in a theory of liberal evolution, according to which sustained economic growth, by increasing wealth and the size of the middle class, gradually makes a country more democratic.	大多数西方人相信自由演变的理论。 根据这一理论，持续的经济增长提高财富、扩大中产阶级的规模，将逐步让国家变得更为民主。
While the long-run record of this theory is irrefutable, China’s authoritarian ruling elite is not only determined to hold on to power, but it also has been smart enough to take adaptive measures aimed at countering the liberalizing effects of economic development.	尽管这一理论的长期性纪录毋庸置疑，但是，中国专制主义统治精英不仅决心保持权力，而且，它已经聪明之极，采取适应性措施，目的在于打击经济发展的自由化效果。
Thus, for all its awe-inspiring economic achievement, China has made remarkably little progress in political liberalization.	因此，尽管取得了令人仰慕的经济发展成就，中国在政治自由化方面依然裹足不前。
Indeed, judging by several key indicators, progress toward democracy in China has stalled, despite unprecedented economic prosperity and personal freedom.	实际上，根据几项关键性指标来评估，尽管中国取得了前所未有的经济繁荣和个人自由，其朝向民主的进步已经停滞。
For instance, in the mid-1980’s, Chinese leaders seriously discussed and later drew up a blueprint for modest democratic reforms.	例如，八十年代中期，中国领导人认真地讨论并后来制定了温和的民主改革的蓝图。
Today, the topic of political reform is taboo.	今天，政治改革的话题是禁区。
Nearly all the major institutional reforms, such as strengthening the legislature, holding village elections, and building a modern legal system, were launched in the 1980’s.	几乎所有主要的机构性改革，例如加强人大、举行乡村选举以及建立现代司法制度等都是在八十年代发起的。
Since the Tiananmen Square massacre of June 1989, however, not a single major democratic reform initiative has been implemented.	但是，自从1989年6月天安门广场屠杀以来，没有任何一个主要的民主改革项目得到了实行。
Instead of democratic transition, China has witnessed a consolidation of authoritarian rule – the strengthening of a one-party regime through organizational learning and adaptation.	中国不仅没有实行民主转型，其专制统治，也就是通过组织上的学习和改造强化一党统治反而得到了加强。
Since 1989, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has been pursuing a two-pronged strategy: selective repression that targets organized political opposition and co-optation of new social elites (the intelligentsia, professionals, and private entrepreneurs).	1989年以来，中国共产党一直实行两手策略，即针对有组织的政治反对派进行有选择的镇压以及拉拢收买社会精英（知识分子、专业人员以及私营企业家 ） 。
This strategy emphasizes the maintenance of an extensive law enforcement apparatus designed to eliminate any incipient organized opposition.	这一策略强调维持庞大的执法力量，目的在于消灭任何早期的有组织反对势力。
Huge investments have strengthened the People’s Armed Police (PAP), a large anti-riot paramilitary force whose specialty is the quick suppression of anti-government protests by disgruntled industrial workers, peasants, and urban residents.	武警是一支庞大的半军事化防暴力量，专门用来迅速镇压怨声载道的产业工人、农民和城市居民的反政府抗议。 中共投入巨资加强其力量。
Frequent deployment of the PAP is a major reason why the tens of thousands of collective protests that occur each year (74,000 in 2004 and 86,000 in 2005) have had a negligible impact on China’s overall stability.	时常调集武警，因此，每年数以万计的集体抗议事件（2004年7万4千起，2005年8万6千起）对中国的整体稳定无关痛痒。
To deal with new emerging political threats, such as the information revolution, the Chinese government has spent mightily on manpower and technology.	为了应付类似信息革命等新涌现的政治威胁，中国政府花费巨资增强人员和技术。
A special 30,000-strong police unit monitors and screens Internet traffic, advanced technology is deployed to block access to overseas Web sites considered “hostile or harmful,” and Internet service and content providers, both domestic and Western, must comply with onerous restrictions designed to suppress political dissent and track down offenders.	3万多人组成的特别网警监视和过滤互联网内容，采用先进技术阻挡被认为是“敌对和有害”的海外网站。 国内和西方的互联网服务和内容供应商必须遵守严格的限制措施，目的在于压制政治异议以及追踪违反者。
The regime has even conducted multi-agency exercises to test whether different government bodies could cooperate closely to keep “harmful information” off the Net during an emergency.	中共甚至举行了多部门的演习来测试不同的政府部门是否能够紧密合作，在紧急情况下将“有害信息”拒之于网门之外。
Having learned from the collapse of the Soviet Union that a bureaucratic ruling party must co-opt new social elites to deprive potential opposition groups of leaders, the Communist Party has conducted an effective campaign of expanding its social base.	中共从苏联解体中得到教训，那就是官僚的执政党必须拉拢新的社会精英来剥夺潜在反对团伙的领导人，因此，它有效地扩大了其社会基础。
The urban intelligentsia and professionals have been pampered with material perks and political recognition, while new private entrepreneurs have been allowed to join the Party.	城市知识分子和专业人员大举获得物质实惠和政治承认，而新兴的私营企业家则被允许入党。
This strategy of pre-emptive political decapitation has produced enormous dividends for the Party.	中共从这种先发制人的政治斩首战略中获益不少。
In the 1980’s, its principal adversaries were the urban intelligentsia, who constituted the backbone of the pro-democracy movement that culminated in Tiananmen Square.	八十年代，中共的主要对手是城市知识分子，他们构成了要求民主运动的骨干力量，这场运动最终导致天安门事件。
Today, the mainstream of the Chinese intelligentsia is an integral part of the ruling elite.	今天，中国知识分子的主流是统治精英不可或缺的一部分。
Many have joined the Party and become government officials, and a large percentage enjoy various professional and financial privileges.	许多人已经入党当官，还有很大一部分人则享受专业和财政上的特权。
Predictably, the intelligentsia, usually the most liberal social group, is no longer a lethal threat to party rule.	不难想见，知识分子尽管通常是最为自由化的社会团体，但是他们已经不再是中共统治的致命威胁了。
Worse, without support from this strategic group, other social groups, such as workers and peasants, have become politically marginalized and rudderless.	更糟的是，没有这一战略性团体的支持，其他社会团体，例如工人和农民已经在政治上被边缘化了，而且群龙无首。
Although the Party’s carrot-and-stick approach has worked since 1989, it is doubtful that it will retain its efficacy for another 17 years.	尽管中共的胡萝卜加大棒的政策自1989年以来一直奏效，它能够在下一个17年里维持其效力还很难说。
To the extent that China’s authoritarian regime is by nature exclusionary (it can only incorporate a limited number of elites), the co-optation strategy will soon run up against its limits, and the Party will no longer have the resources to buy off the intelligentsia or keep private entrepreneurs happy.	只要中国的专制统治政权在本质上排除异己（它只能吸纳数量有限的精英 ） ， 拉拢收买策略不久就会黔驴技穷，而中共也就不会再有资源来收买知识分子或者让私营企业家心满意足。
At the same time, selective repression can contain social frustrations and discontent only temporarily.	与此同时，有选择性的打压只能暂时控制社会失望和不满。
As long as much of Chinese society views the current political system as unjust, unresponsive, and corrupt, there will always be a large reservoir of ill will toward the ruling elites.	只要中国社会的大部分都认为当前的政治体制不公正、麻木不仁以及腐败，那么，就会有大量的朝向统治精英的恶意。
When things go wrong – as is likely, given mounting social strains caused by rising inequality, environmental degradation, and deteriorating public services – China’s alienated masses could become politically radicalized.	鉴于不平等加剧、环境破坏以及日益崩溃的公共服务引发不断上涨的社会压力，形势有可能恶化。 持敌对意见的中国大众有可能在政治上极端化。
And, unlike past protests, which have usually been allied with students or members of the intelligentsia, popular disaffection might not have the virtue of rational leaders with whom the government could talk and negotiate.	以往的抗议大多与学生或知识分子结盟，与此不同的是，大众的不满不大可能具有理性的、政府可以对话和谈判的领导人了。
So it may be premature for the Party to celebrate the success of its adaptive strategy.	所以，中共现在庆贺其适应策略的胜利为时尚早。
China’s rulers may have stalled democratic trends for now, but the current strategy has, perhaps, merely delayed the inevitable.	中国的统治者现在可能拖延了民主趋势，但是，目前的策略可能只不过是推迟了不可避免的事情。
	
The Mirage of the Financial Singularity	金融奇点的幻象
NEW HAVEN – In their new book The Incredible Shrinking Alpha, Larry E. Swedroe and Andrew L. Berkin describe an investment environment populated by increasingly sophisticated analysts who rely on big data, powerful computers, and scholarly research.	发自纽黑文 — — 在拉里·E·斯威德罗和安德烈·L·博尔金发表的新书 ， 《 不可思议的高回报萎缩》中，他们描述了一个充斥着日渐老练的高精尖分析员依赖大数据，超级电脑和学术研究成果工作的投资环境。
With all this competition, “the hurdles to achieving alpha [returns above a risk-adjusted benchmark – and thus a measure of success in picking individual investments] are getting higher and higher.”	在所有这些竞争态势之下 ， “ 实现高回报（也就是获取高于所承担风险基准的回报并以此制定一个挑选各单一投资方式的成功策略）的门槛将越来越高 ” 。
That conclusion raises a key question: Will alpha eventually go to zero for every imaginable investment strategy?	这一结论产生了一个关键问题：对于所有人类可以设想出的投资策略来说，高回报是否最终会归零？
More fundamentally, is the day approaching when, thanks to so many smart people and smarter computers, financial markets really do become perfect, and we can just sit back, relax, and assume that all assets are priced correctly?	更根本的是，是否有一天，在所有这些聪明人和更聪明的电脑的作用下，金融市场会否最终达到了完美的平衡，而我们只需要坐在那里什么都不干，并假设所有资产都被合理的定价？
This imagined state of affairs might be called the financial singularity, analogous to the hypothetical future technological singularity, when computers replace human intelligence.	这个想象中的状况或许可被称为金融奇点，也是一个与设想中的未来科技奇点相似的东西，也就是电脑会代替人类智能。
The financial singularity implies that all investment decisions would be better left to a computer program, because the experts with their algorithms have figured out what drives market outcomes and reduced it to a seamless system.	而金融奇点则意味着，所有的投资决策最好留给电脑程序去决定，因为那些算法研究专家们已经找出了驱动市场表现的背后动力，并将其精简成为了一个天衣无缝的系统
Many believe that we are almost there.	许多人相信我们离那天不远了。
Even legendary investors like Warren Buffett, it is argued, are not really outperforming the market.	甚至认为即便是像沃伦·巴菲特这样的传奇投资者其实也并没有表现得比市场更好。
In a recent paper, “Buffett’s Alpha,” Andrea Frazzini and David Kabiller of AQR Capital Management and Lasse Pedersen of Copenhagen Business School, conclude that Buffett is not generating significantly positive alpha if one takes account of certain lesser-known risk factors that have weighed heavily in his portfolio. The implication is that Buffet’s genius could be replicated by a computer program that incorporates these factors.	在最近发表的一篇名为《巴菲特高回报》的文章中，AQR资本管理的安德烈·法兹尼和戴维·卡比勒，以及哥本哈根商学院的拉斯·佩德森总结认为，如果考虑到巴菲特投资组合中某些权重极大的但不太为人知的风险因素，他其实并未获取非常巨大的正回报，暗示巴菲特的天赋是可以被一个综合协调所有这些因素的电脑程序所替代的。
If that were true, investors would abandon, en masse, their efforts to ferret out mispricing in the market, because there wouldn’t be any.	如果这是真的话，投资者们会立刻全体行动，放弃尝试纠正市场错误定价的努力，因为不会再存在任何错误定价了。
Market participants would rationally assume that every stock price is the true expected present value of future cash flows, with the appropriate rate of discount, and that those cash flows reflect fundamentals that everyone understands the same way.	市场参与者们会理性的假设每一个股价都是未来现金流预期的真实当前体现，而且折价率也非常恰当，而所有人对那些现金流所反映的基本面的理解都是一致的。
Investors’ decisions would diverge only because of differences in their personal situation.	投资者决策只是因为他们个人状况的不同而有所不同。
For example, an automotive engineer might not buy automotive stocks – and might even short them – as a way to hedge the risk to his or her own particular type of human capital.	比如说一个汽车工程师可能不会购买汽车公司的股票甚至会故意做空其中某个股票，以便对冲他或者她自身特定种类的人力资本风险。
Indeed, according to a computer crunching big data, this would be an optimal decision.	事实上，对于一个拼命处理大数据的电脑来说，这才是一个最优选项。
There is a long-recognized problem with such perfect markets: No one would want to expend any effort to figure out what oscillations in prices mean for the future.	但这些完美市场也存在一个长期被认识到的问题：没人再会花费任何精力去找出价格的波动对未来意味着什么。
Thirty-five years ago, in their classic paper, “On the Impossibility of Informationally Efficient Markets,” Sanford Grossman and Joseph Stiglitz presented this problem as a paradox: Perfectly efficient markets require the effort of smart money to make them so; but if markets were perfect, smart money would give up trying.	在经典论文《论信息有效市场的不可能性》中，森福德·格罗斯曼和约瑟夫·斯蒂格利茨将这一问题视作一个矛盾个体：完美有效的市场需要聪明的资金不断努力去达到完美，但一旦市场变成了完美，这些聪明的资金将不会再进行任何运作了。
The Grossman-Stiglitz conundrum seems less compelling in the financial singularity if we can imagine that computers direct all the investment decisions.	但如果我们想象只有电脑来指导所有投资决策的话，格罗斯曼-斯蒂格利茨迷题什么似乎在金融奇点方面缺乏说服力。
Although alpha may be vanishingly small, it still represents enough profit to keep the computers running.	虽然高回报或许会小得不能再小，但始终意味着足够的利益去让这些电脑继续运作。
But the real problem with this vision of financial singularity is not the Grossman-Stiglitz conundrum; it is that real-world markets are nowhere close to it.	但对于这一金融奇点未来图景的真正问题并不是格罗斯曼-斯蒂格利茨迷题，而是真实的市场跟这就跟这个完全不相似。
Computer enthusiasts are excited by things like the blockchain used by Bitcoin (covered on an education website called Singularity University, in a section dramatically titled Exponential Finance).	电脑爱好者们会为比特币所用的阻断链欢呼雀跃（由一个叫基点大学的教育网站中戏剧化地命名为指数金融的部分所描述 ) 。
But the futurists’ financial world bears no resemblance to today’s financial world.	但未来主义者的金融世界可能与目前的金融事件没有任何相似之处。
After all, the financial singularity implies that all prices would be based on such things as optimally projected future corporate profits and the correlation of profits with expected technological innovations and long-term demographic changes.	毕竟金融基点意味着所有的价格将会基于最优投射的未来企业盈利，以及这些盈利与预期的技术革新和长期人口结构变化的相关性。
But the smart money hardly ever talks in such ethereal terms.	但那些聪明资金却绝少谈及这些超现实的词汇。
In this context, it is difficult not to think of China’s recent stock-market plunge.	在这一背景下很难不去联想起中国市场最近的股票大跌。
News accounts depict hordes of emotional people trading on hunch and superstition.	新闻里描述成群像游牧民族般狂热的人们凭着直觉和迷信进行交易。
That looks a lot more like reality than all the talk of impending financial singularity.	而相比于所谓的金融奇点来说，这更像真实的市场。
Markets seem to be driven by stories, as I emphasize in my book Irrational Exuberance. There are stories of great new eras and of looming depressions.	正如在我的新书《非理性充沛》中写的那样，市场似乎是有故事驱动的，同时也存在着伟大新时代和衰退即将逼近的故事，也有一些基本面故事关于技术和资源枯竭的，还有关于政治和令人瞠目结舌的阴谋的故事。
There are fundamental stories about technology and declining resources.	
And there are stories about politics and bizarre conspiracies.	
No one knows if these stories are true, but they take on a life of their own.	没人知道这些故事是否是真的，但这些故事却有着自身的生命力。
Sometimes they go viral.	有时这些故事像病毒一样传播。
When one has a heart-to-heart talk with many seemingly rational people, they turn out to have crazy theories.	当你和许多看上去似乎理性的人深入交谈的时候，他们都会满嘴疯狂理论。
These people influence markets, because all other investors must reckon with them; and their craziness is not going away anytime soon.	这些人会影响市场，因为其他所有的投资者都必须参考他们的决策，而他们的疯狂也不会在短期内消失。
Maybe Buffett’s past investing style can be captured in a trading algorithm today.	或许巴菲特过去的投资风格可以被当今一个交易算法所模仿。
But that does not necessarily detract from his genius.	但这不一定会有损于他的天才。
Indeed, the true source of his success may consist in his understanding of when to abandon one method and devise another.	事实上，他成功的真正源泉或许是因为他能理解是什么时候应当放弃一个投资手法并选择另外一种。
The idea of financial singularity may seem inspiring; but it is no less illusory than the rational Utopia that inspired generations of central planners.	金融奇点的理论似乎除非常振奋人心，但是这也并不比那些鼓舞了数代中央计划者的理性乌托帮一样虚幻。
Human judgment, good and bad, will drive investment decisions and financial-market outcomes for the rest of our lives and beyond.	人类的判断，无论是好还是坏，都将在我们的余生甚至更长时间推动投资决策和金融市场表现。
	
Are Emerging Markets the Canary in the Financial Coal Mine?	新兴市场是金融煤矿中的金丝雀吗？
BUENOS AIRES – Are brewing exchange-rate and debt crises in Argentina and Turkey localized events without broader implications?	布宜诺斯艾利斯—在阿根廷和土耳其不断发酵的汇率和债务危机是不会产生更大影响的局部事件吗？
Or are they early warning signs of deeper fragilities in bloated global debt markets that are being exposed as the US Federal Reserve continues to normalize interest rates?	还是早期预警型号，表明高处不胜寒的全球债务市场存在深度脆弱性，随着美联储利率正常化政策的额继续，这些脆弱性正在暴露？
Rising interest rates could test stability in some advanced economies as well, especially in Italy, where voters, particularly in the less developed south, have opted decisively for a disruptive populist government.	升息对于一些发达经济体也是稳定性的考验，特别是在意大利。 意大利选民，尤其是较不发达的南方地区的选民，断然决然地选择了一个破坏性民粹主义政府。
With an economy ten times the size of Greece, a default in Italy would blow up the eurozone.	意大利经济规模是希腊的十倍，它如果违约将引爆欧元区。
Indeed, the populist coalition government that has now taken power has hinted that it wants write-offs for some of its under-the-table debts (not included in Italy’s official public debt of over 130% of GDP) to the euro system through the European Central Bank.	事实上，目前已经掌权的民粹主义执政联盟暗示它希望减记部分通过欧洲央行欠下的秘密欧元体系债务（不包括在意大利超过GDP的130%的官方公共债务中 ） 。
The good news is that a full-blown global debt crisis is still relatively unlikely to erupt.	好消息是全面全球债务危机爆发的可能性仍相对较低。
Even with a recent softening of European performance, the overall global economic picture remains strong, with most regions of the world still growing briskly.	即使最近欧洲表现欠佳，总体全球经济状况仍然坚挺，大部分地区增长仍然喜人。
Although it is true that several emerging-market firms have piled up worrisome quantities of dollar-denominated external debt, many foreign central banks are brimming with dollar assets, especially in Asia.	诚然，一些新兴市场企业累积的美元计价外债数量令人担忧，但许多外国央行拥有充足的美元资产，特别是亚洲。
The International Monetary Fund, moreover, has sufficient resources to handle a first wave of crises, even if it includes, say, Brazil.	此外，国际货币基金组织（IMF）有充足的资源应对第一波危机，即使其中包括（比如）巴西。
The main concern is not that the IMF will fail to deliver funds, but that it will make the same mistake it did in Greece, by not imposing a realistic deal on debtors and creditors.	主要问题不是IMF无法提供资金，而是它重蹈在希腊身上犯过的错误，没有让债务国和债权人达成现实的协议。
As for Italy, chances are that Europe will find a way to grant temporarily some of the extra budget slack the new government seeks, even if there is no way eurozone officials can allow high-debt Italy simply to destroy the common currency.	对于意大利，最有可能的情况是欧洲找到办法临时为新政府提供一些它所寻求的额外预算豁免，即使欧元区官员绝不会允许负债累累的意大利毁掉共同货币。
The most important reason for optimism, notwithstanding all the surrounding political noise, is that global long-term real interest rates are still extremely low.	身处政治噪声中保持乐观的最重要的理由是全球长期真实利率仍然低到极点。
Even with all the drama surrounding Fed tightening, 30-year inflation-indexed Treasury bills are paying around 1% – far below long-term real returns, which have averaged closer to 3%.	在美联储紧缩导致全球反应的情况下，30年期通胀指数美国国债的利率仍然只有1%左右 — — 远低于平均接近3%的长期真实回报率。
As long as the underlying global interest-rate picture is so benign, it is hard to see the big Kahuna of bond-default waves coming just yet.	只要全球利率背景保持如此有利，很难想象会立即发生大规模债券违约。
It is notable how much the IMF, the world’s debt and financial crisis watchdog, has been ratcheting up its warnings.	引人注目的是，世界债务和金融危机监督员IMF是如何修正它的警告的。
After years of saying advanced countries no longer need to worry about their near-record public-debt levels – now averaging over 100% for general government debt – the IMF has started to warn that many countries may find themselves squeezed for fiscal space if faced with a new recession anytime soon.	多年来，IMF一直表示发达国家不再需要担心接近纪录的公共债务水平 — — 目前平均高达一般政府债务的100%以上 — — 如今，IMF开始警告许多国家如果面临新的衰退，财政操作的空间将十分吃紧。
The challenges stem not only from debt that is on the books, but also from hidden liabilities, owing most notably to massively underfunded old-age pension and health-care programs – implicit debts that in many cases are far larger than the official figures.	挑战不仅来自账面上的债务，也来自隐藏负债，其中最主要的来源是大规模亏空的高龄退休金和医保计划 — — 这些隐性债务在许多国家比官方数字大得多。
The overwhelming evidence of recent research supports the IMF view.	最新研究提出了压倒性证据支持IMF的观点。
Countries with historically high debt levels have (on average) significantly poorer growth performance in the face of major shocks, and the long-term relation between high public debt and growth is distinctly negative.	债务水平创造历史记录的国家（平均而言）在面临重大冲击时的增长表现显著更低，高公共债务水平和增长之间的相关性也显著为负。
This, of course, says absolutely nothing about the economic consequences of actively reducing the burden of government debt, popularly known as “austerity.”	当然，这完全不能说明积极降低政府债务负担 — — 即人们所熟知的“紧缩 — — ”的经济后果。
Deep recessions are the time to use a country’s war chest, not the time to build it up.	深度衰退是动用而不是构建一国备战资金的时候。
Admittedly, there are those on both the left and the right who think “this time is different” for advanced economies.	诚然，左翼和右翼都有人认为发达各经济体“这次不一样 ” 。
With no realistic danger (in their view) of a major war or financial crisis anytime soon, it is folly to exercise too much restraint on public debt or pension promises.	在他们看来，近期不存在切实的大战或金融危机危险，对公共债务或退休金承诺横加限制是愚蠢的。
This is dangerous thinking even for the United States, despite the greater fiscal scope it enjoys as the issuer of the global reserve currency.	即便对于美国来说，这种思维也相当危险，尽管作为全球储备货币发行者，美国拥有更大的财政空间。
Very bad shocks can happen to any economy, and their sources might not be the ones we normally consider.	任何经济体都有可能受到非常糟糕的冲击，这些冲击可能并非来自我们通常所考虑的源头。
For example, risks stemming from cyberattacks (especially by state actors), pandemics, and certainly financial crises are probably far higher than anyone would like to admit.	比如，来自网络攻击（尤其是国家行动方发动的网络攻击 ） 、 流行病以及（当然包括）金融危机的风险也许要远高于所有人愿意承认的程度。
It is certainly not difficult to imagine a temporary slowdown in fast-growing China that could roil world markets.	高速增长的中国暂时减速导致世界市场动荡的情形绝非难以想象。
And if the completely unexpected does happen, one thing we can anticipate is that governments with strong access to global credit markets will have much better options for responding.	而如果真的发生了出乎意料的情况，可以预期能够轻松进入全球信用市场的国家将拥有好得多的应对选择。
Even if the best bet is that any emerging-market bond meltdown would remain contained, today’s jitters ought to be a wake-up call, even for advanced economies.	即使最有可能发生的事情是新兴市场债券崩溃无论如何都不会掀起大波澜，今天的精神过敏也应该作为警报，发达经济体也不能例外。
After all, no country, however rich, should bet its future on the prospect that today’s ultra-benign interest-rate environment will last forever.	毕竟，不论一个国家多么富裕，都不应该把未来寄托在今天的极端有利的利率环境能够永远持续上。
Economists who assure us that advanced-economy debt is completely “safe” sound eerily like those who touted the “Great Moderation” – the supposedly permanent reduction in cyclical volatility – a generation ago.	那些向我们保证发达经济体债务完全“安全”的经济学家和那些一代人之前鼓吹“大稳健 ” — —周期性波动永久性降低 — — 的经济学家有如一丘之貉。
In many cases, they are the same people.	在很大程度上，他们是同一拨人。
But, as we saw a decade ago, and will inevitably see again, we are not at the “End of History” when it comes to global debt and financial crises.	但和十年前一样，并且未来也将是如此，对于全球债务和金融危机，我们并没有站在“历史的终点 ” 。
	
Will Europe Be Willing but Disabled?	欧洲非不为，乃不能乎？
NEWPORT BEACH – When it comes to describing Europe’s ever-worsening crisis, metaphors abound.	纽波特海滩—在描述欧洲不断恶化的危机时，可谓遍地隐喻。
For some, it is five minutes to midnight; for others, Europe is a car accelerating towards the edge of a cliff.	一些人说，太晚了；另一些人说，欧洲就像是开足了马力驶向悬崖的汽车。
For all, a perilous existential moment is increasingly close at hand.	所有人都说，生死存亡的时刻越来越近了。
Optimists – fortunately, there remain a few, especially in Europe itself – believe that when the situation becomes really critical, political leaders will turn things around and put Europe back on the path of economic growth, job creation, and financial stability.	乐观派 — — 幸运的是，这类人依然存在，特别是在欧洲存在 — — 认为当临界时刻真的来临时，政治领导人会力挽狂澜，把欧洲带回经济增长、就业创造和金融稳定的正规上来。
But pessimists have been growing in number and influence.	但悲观派的人数和影响力正在与日俱增。
They see political dysfunction adding to financial turmoil, thereby amplifying the eurozone’s initial design flaws.	他们看到，在金融动荡之外，政治瘫痪正在发生，这扩大了欧元区原始设计漏洞。
Of course, who is ultimately proven correct is a function of eurozone governments’ willingness to make the difficult decisions that are required, and in a coordinated and timely fashion.	当然，谁最终会被证明是正确的取决于欧元区各国政府是否愿意及时、合作地做出必须的决策。
But that is not the only determinant: governments must also be able to turn things around once the willingness to do so materializes.	但这并非唯一的决定因素：在“为”的意愿成为现实时，政府还必须“能”力挽狂澜。
And here, the endless delays are making the challenges more daunting and the outcome more uncertain.	而正是在这方面，没完没了的延迟让挑战越来越令人畏惧，也让结果越来越不确定。
Experienced observers remind us that crises, rather than vision, have tended to drive progress at critical stages of Europe’s historic integration – a multi-decade journey driven by the desire to ensure long-term peace and prosperity in what previously had been one of the world’s most violent regions and the site of appalling human suffering.	有经验的观察家提醒我们，危机，而不是愿景，更能在欧洲历史性一体化的关节阶段推动进步。 欧洲一体化是一个几十年的历程，其背后的推动力是对确保在这个曾经是全世界最暴力地区、饱受可怕人道灾难摧残的地区实现长期和平与繁荣的渴望。
After all, the European Union (including the eurozone’s 17 members) remains a collective of nation-states with notable divergences in economic, financial, and social conditions.	毕竟，欧盟（包括由17个成员国组成的欧元区）仍只是国家的组合，各国在经济、金融和社会条件诸方面存在巨大差异。
Cultural differences persist.	文化差异也持久存在着。
Political cycles are far from synchronized.	政治周期也远称不上同步。
And too many regional governance mechanisms, with the important exception of the European Central Bank, lack sufficient influence, credibility, and, therefore, effectiveness.	而太多的地区治理机制（欧洲央行是一个显著的例外）缺乏足够的影响力和信誉，从而效率低下。
Left to its own devices, such a grouping is vulnerable to recurrent bickering, disruptive posturing, and disagreement over visions of the future.	若任其自身自灭的话，这样一种组合极易因反复争吵、破坏性故作姿态以及在未来愿景问题上的分歧而深受伤害。
As a result, progress towards meaningful economic and political integration can be painfully slow during the good times.	结果，在好光景时，通往真正经济和政治一体化之路困难又缓慢。
But all of this can change rapidly when a crisis looms, especially if it threatens the integrity of the European project.	但若危机降临，所有这些都可以发生快速变化，特别是当危机威胁到欧洲工程的完整性时。
That is where the eurozone is today.	而欧元区如今就处于这样一个时刻。
A debt crisis that erupted in Greece, the eurozone’s outer periphery, has migrated with a vengeance towards the core, so much so that the survival of the eurozone itself is at stake.	欧元区外围国希腊所爆发的债务危机复仇般地朝核心国蔓延，以至于威胁到欧元区自身的生存。
The more the policy response has lagged, the broader the set of questions about Europe’s future has become.	政策反应月缓慢，关于欧洲未来的质疑声就越多。
Maintaining a 17-member monetary union is no longer a given.	维持17国组成的货币联盟已不再是理所当然之事。
Talk of countries exiting, starting with Greece (the “Grexit”), is now rampant.	让一些国家退出的声音 — — 首先是希腊，称为“希腊退出 ” — —现在已相当普遍。
And only hard-core idealists dismiss altogether the mounting risk of the eurozone’s total disintegration.	只有最顽固不化的理想主义者才会对日渐增加的欧元区总体瓦解危险视而不见。
Nonetheless, many veterans of the European integration project see a silver lining in the dark clouds massing over their creation.	尽管如此，许多经验丰富的欧洲一体化工程实验者还是在围绕他们的心血的阴云中看到了一丝曙光。
For them, only a crisis can stop politicians from just kicking various cans farther down the road and, instead, catalyze the policy initiatives – greater fiscal, banking, and political union – that, together with monetary union, would ensure that the eurozone rests on a stable and sustainable four-legged platform.	对他们来说，唯有危机才能让政客们停止得过且过的幻想，刺激政策出台，在货币联盟之上加以银行联盟和政治联盟，确保欧元区能有一个稳定而可持续的四脚平台。
But this view is not without its own risks.	但这一观点���不是没有风险的。
It assumes that, when push comes to shove, political leaders will indeed do what is necessary – the willingness question.	它包含一个假设，当事情演变为千钧一发时，政治领导人真会去应该做的事情 — — 这是“为”的问题。
It also presumes that they will have the capacity to do so – the ability question.	它还包含另一个假设，政治领导人有能力做这些事 — — 这是“能”的问题。
And, over time, uncertainty concerning the latter question has risen to an uncomfortable level.	而随着时间的推移，后一个问题上的不确定性已上升到了令人不安的水平。
Today’s eurozone is beset by an unprecedented degree of rejection – on economic, financial, political, and social grounds – by citizens in a growing number of countries.	眼下，欧元区正深陷前所未有的不合作态度的重围，越来越多的国家的国民在经济、金融、政治和社会领域无法达成一致。
The longer this persists, the harder it will be for politicians to maintain control of their countries’ destinies and that of Europe’s collective enterprise.	这一状况持续得越久，政客就越难控制国家命运，欧洲这一集体的未来也就越悬。
Private-sector activity is slowing, and it is nearing a standstill in the eurozone’s most vulnerable economy (Greece), where a bank run is in full swing.	私人部门活动正在放缓，在欧元区最疲软经济体（希腊，那里正在爆发全面银行挤兑）更是接近停滞。
Elsewhere, too, depositors are beginning to transfer their savings to the strongest economy (Germany) and to safe havens beyond (Switzerland and the United States).	在其他地方，存款人也在开始将储蓄转移到欧元区内最坚挺经济体（德国）和区外安全港（瑞士和美国 ） 。
Weaker companies are shedding labor, while stronger firms are delaying investments in plant and equipment.	疲软公司正在裁员，坚挺公司则推迟了厂房和设备投资。
And global investors continue to exit the eurozone in droves, shifting countries’ liabilities to taxpayers and the ECB’s balance sheet.	全球投资者继续蜂拥逃离欧元区，各国负债不断地被转移给纳税人和欧洲央行。
No wonder that social unrest is evident in a growing number of countries.	毫无疑问，越来越多的国家已经出现显而易见的社会动荡迹象。
No wonder that fringe political movements are gaining traction throughout the eurozone.	毫无疑问，边缘政治运动正在整个欧元区赢得动力。
And no wonder that voters in almost two-thirds of eurozone countries have turned out the incumbents in their most recent elections.	毫无疑问，近三分之二欧元区国家的选民在最近的选举中抛弃了现任政府。
All of this serves to undermine the effectiveness of government policies – by reducing their credibility, clogging their channels of transmission to the economy, and making it difficult to offset the withdrawal of private-sector capital and spending.	所有这些都削弱了政府政策的效率 — — 损害了政策的信誉、堵住了政策向经济的传播渠道、增加了抵消私人部门资本和支出减少的难度。
As a result, the market-based economic and financial systems that prevail in Europe, and that, not so long ago, were a source of significant strength, are losing their vibrancy.	结果，在欧洲处于绝对优势地位、不久前仍是欧洲主要优势之所在的市场经济和金融体系正在丧失活力。
I, too, am fond of metaphors.	我对隐喻也感兴趣。
During a trip to the continent last week, I heard one that captures very well the key dynamic in Europe today.	上周，我对欧洲大陆进行了访问，期间我听说了一个能够很好地抓住当今欧洲动态关键点的隐喻。
The eurozone’s leaders are on a raft heading towards a life-threatening waterfall.	欧元区领导人正身处一艘救生筏上。 这艘救生筏正在驶向致命瀑布。
The longer they wait, the more the raft gains speed.	欧元区领导人等得越久，救生筏的速度就越快。
So the outcome no longer depends only on their willingness to cooperate in order to navigate the raft to safety. It also hinges on their ability to do so in the midst of natural forces that are increasingly difficult to control and overcome.	因此，结果不仅取决于他们愿不愿意合作以改变救生筏方向驶向安全，也取决于他们能不能做到这一点 — — 他们所处的自然环境意味着控制和赢得胜利的难度正变得越来越大。
The message is clear.	形势十分明朗。
The current crisis might indeed eventually break eurozone leaders’ inherent resistance to compromise, collaboration, and common action.	当前的危机或许确实能够在最终打破欧元区领导人对妥协、合作、采取共同行动的天生抵制。
But the longer they bicker and dither, the greater the risk that what they gain in willingness will be lost to incapacity.	但他们争吵和犹豫的时间越长，他们在“为”方面所取得的进展因“能”方面的欠缺而沦为于事无补的风险就越大。
	
Will Europe Learn to Love Bush?	欧洲会开始喜欢布什吗？
President George W. Bush will soon travel to Europe, and President Jacques Chirac will visit Washington.	布什总统即将展开欧洲之行，而希拉克总统也即将访问华盛顿。
EU “Foreign Minister” Javier Solana has already been there, and returned bullish on future transatlantic cooperation.	欧盟的“外交部长” 贾维尔·索拉纳已先期到过华府，归来后对跨大西洋合作的未来豪情万丈。
Atmospherically, at least, relations have, indeed, improved since the US presidential election, and both sides have expressed good will.	从气氛上看，至少欧美之间的关系自美国总统大选之后确实有所改善，且双方都表示过良好的意愿。
Yet there is little ground for genuine optimism.	然而，这还不足以让我们对此感到真正的乐观。
Bush’s declared intention to “better explain the reasons for his decisions” to America’s Allies simply will not do.	布什所宣称的向其盟国“更好地解释他的决策理由”的意图不会奏效。
Europeans don’t want explanations; they want to be consulted – to have input into American decision-making and see their concerns reflected in US foreign policy.	欧洲人不想听解释；他们想要协商—影响美国的决策并看到他们所关注的问题从美国的外交政策中反映出来。
None of this is likely to happen.	而这样的情况似乎不会发生。
On the contrary, the US is continuing to thwart European efforts gradually to establish a rule-based international order.	相反，美国正继续阻碍欧洲的努力以求建立一种以统治为基础的国际秩序。
There are no signs that the Bush administration is relenting on, for example, the UN, the Kyoto Protocol, the International Criminal Court, the ban on land mines, or the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.	布什政府对例如联合国 、 《 京都议定书 》 、 国际刑事法院、禁止地雷或反弹道导弹公约等事务方面也没有态度缓和的迹象。
In Iraq, Europeans fully share the American objectives of preserving the country’s unity and achieving at least some modicum of democracy.	在伊拉克，欧洲人完全支持美国维护该国统一和至少实现一定程度民主的目标。
At the same time, they believe that it is up to the US to remove the chaos it created, so they are reluctant to contribute to the task in a substantive way.	同时，他们认为美国应该为其造成的混乱负责，所以不愿为实现这一目标做出实质性的贡献。
European attitudes may seem shortsighted to Americans, but it would need a lot of cajoling to change them.	在美国人看来，欧洲的态度未免有点鼠目寸光，但要使欧洲人改变这一点需要美国付出相当的努力。
There is general agreement on the aims to be achieved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: the end of violence and a peaceful solution based on the concept of two sovereign states.	欧美在解决巴以冲突要达成的目标方面也有共识：终止暴力和一个以两个主权国家的理念为基础的和平解决方案。
However, Europeans consider the opinion recently expressed by Bush – that Palestinian democracy and not Israeli occupation of the West Bank is at the core of the problem – to be ill conceived.	然而，欧洲人认为布什最近发表的关于巴勒斯坦的民主而非以色列对约旦河西岸的占领才是问题核心的言论有失妥当。
The same is true with respect to the President’s assertion that Israel’s permanent presence in Palestinian territories and the non-return of Palestinian refugees to their homes in Israel must be accepted as realities on the ground.	同样欠妥的，还有布什关于必须接受以色列在巴领土上的永久性存在和不允许巴勒斯坦难民重返其以色列家园这些既成事实的言论。
It may well be that such painful deviations from agreed principles will be reflected in an eventual comprehensive settlement, but prejudging these issues before the beginning of negotiations denies the Palestinians some of their most important bargaining chips.	这种对公认原则的严重背离最终很可能以混合的聚居点的形式反映出来，但在谈判还未开始之前就给这些问题盖棺定论实际上就剥夺了巴勒斯坦方面一些最重要的谈判筹码。
On the question of Iran’s nuclear weapons capability, Americans and Europeans also fundamentally agree: it should be prevented.	在伊朗制造核武的能力问题上，欧美双方的根本立场是一致的：应该防止。
While the US tries to achieve this through hard power, regime change, sanctions, and threats of pre-emptive military intervention, Europe uses soft power, diplomacy, inclusion, and partnership.	当美国试图通过硬权力、改变政权、制裁和以先发制人的武装干涉相威胁来达到其目的时，欧洲却采用了软权力、外交、接触和伙伴关系的策略。
Unfortunately, this “good cop, bad cop” game doesn’t work in international politics.	不幸的是，这种“好警察，坏警察”的游戏在国际政治中却是行不通的。
European efforts to induce Teheran to renounce its nuclear designs by addressing Iran’s legitimate security concerns and offering important opportunities for economic and social betterment cannot be successful without active US support.	欧洲致力于通过正视伊朗合法的安全考虑和为其提供经济及社会发展的重要机会来促使德黑兰断绝设计核武的意图。 但这种努力没有美国的支持就不能成功。
In other words, Europe’s carrots are not enough; a successful outcome requires American carrots, too.	换言之，欧洲的胡萝卜是不够的；要取得成功还需要美国的怀柔。
By standing aside and discounting the European approach from the outset, America is merely helping to bring about a self-fulfilling prophecy.	美国从一开始就对欧洲的努力漠不关心，因此其作用充其量也只是帮助促成了一个自我实现的预言。
It would be more productive for the US to join in, at the same time agreeing with Europeans on measures to be taken should their combined efforts fail.	更有成效的做法是美国应该参与进来，同时与欧洲就共同努力失败后所应采取的行动达成一致意见。
Relations with China have improved over the years on both sides of the Atlantic.	大西洋两岸与中国的关系随着时间的推移都有所改善。
China has become Europe’s biggest trading partner, and its huge reserves of US dollars has made it America’s most important creditor.	中国已经成为欧洲最大的贸易伙伴，其巨额的美元储备使之成为美国最重要的债权国。
Despite this rosy picture, China could be the cause of a major transatlantic row if Europeans make good on their intention to lift the arms export embargo in place since the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989.	尽管前景光明，但如果欧洲真的实践解除其自1989年天安门事件以来就对中国实施的武器禁运的意图，那么中国就可能成为欧美之间发生争执的重要原因。
The Bush administration is fiercely opposed to lifting the embargo, pointing out that in the event of a military clash over Taiwan, US troops would face weapons provided to China by America’s own allies.	布什政府强烈反对解除禁运，并以一旦台海发生武装冲突，美国军队可能会面对自己的盟国卖给中国的武器为理由。
In fact, European assurances that arms sales to China could be controlled and threats to an ally avoided do appear unconvincing.	事实上，欧洲在对华军售在掌控之中和对盟国的威胁可以被避免方面的保证确实不令人信服。
On the other hand, economic interdependence between Taiwan and mainland China has grown to such an extent that an armed conflict is increasingly unlikely.	另一方面，中国大陆和台湾之间的经济依存度已经变得如此之高，从而使武装冲突的几率进一步降低。
Of course, this would change were Taiwan to push for independence, but it would hardly do so without a nod from Washington.	当然，如果台湾坚持要独立，形势可能会发生改变，但没有华盛顿的默许台湾也不大可能如此行事。
In short, on many of the most important current international issues, Americans and Europeans share the same objectives and basic goals.	简而言之，欧美在当前许多最重要的国际问题方面有着共同的目标和基本立场。
Where they often diverge is in the means to achieve them.	双方出现分歧的地方往往是在达成目的的手段方面。
Political wisdom would demand that the two sides pool their considerable resources and march together whenever possible.	政治��慧要求欧美双方整合其可观的资源，并尽可能步调一致地行动。
This, however, requires a change of attitudes both in America and in Europe.	但这需要欧美双方都改变态度。
Bush must be willing to accept Europeans as genuine partners and stop treating them like recalcitrant vassals.	布什必须愿意接纳欧洲人作为其真正的伙伴，而不是顽抗的附庸。
European leaders must overcome any latent Anti-Americanism and be prepared to make the kind of contributions to common endeavors that would entitle them to equal partnership with the US.	欧洲的领导者们必须克服一切潜在的反美国主义情绪，并准备为实现与美国真正的伙伴关系做出应有的贡献。
	
Will Europe’s Fiscal Compact Work?	欧洲财政契约有用吗？
CAMBRIDGE – At the start of 2013, the eurozone’s “fiscal compact” entered into force, owing to its ratification on December 21 by a 12th country, Finland, a year after German Chancellor Angela Merkel prodded eurozone leaders into agreement.	发自剑桥 — — 在德国总理安吉拉·默克尔（Angela Merkel）敦促欧元区各国领导人达成协议的一年之后，2012年12月21日 ， “ 财政契约”得到了欧元区第12个国家芬兰的批准，由此从2013年起，欧元区“财政契约”开始生效。
The compact – technically called the Treaty on Stability, Coordination, and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union – requires member countries to introduce laws limiting their structural government budget deficits to less than 0.5 % of GDP (or less than 1% of GDP if their debt/GDP ratio is “significantly below 60%”).	这份全称为《欧洲经济货币联盟稳定、协调与治理公约》的文件要求成员国制定法律限制政府结构性预算赤字不得高于GDP的0.5 % （ 如果该国的债务对GDP比率“显著低于60 % ” ，则为1 % ） 。
So, will this new approach work?	那么这一新措施能起到作用吗？
A limit on the “structural deficit” means that a country can run a deficit above the limit to the extent – and only to the extent – that the gap between revenue and spending is cyclical (that is, its economy is operating below potential due to temporary negative shocks).	对“结构性赤字”的限制意味着成员国可以 — — 也只可以 — — 在收入与支出之间的差距是周期性的范围内最大程度地存在财政赤字，所谓周期性是指一国经济在暂时的负面冲击下在低于其潜能的水平上运行。
In other words, the target is cyclically adjusted.	换句话说，所设立目标是可以随周期性调整的。
The budget-balance rule must be adopted in each country – preferably enshrined in their national constitutions – by the end of 2013.	在2013年结束之前，每个成员国都必须将预算平衡内容添加到其法律体系中 — — 最好是加入到本国宪法体系之中。
The aim is to fix Europe’s long-term fiscal problem, which has been exacerbated by three factors: the failure, since the euro’s inception, of the eurozone-wide Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) to enforce deficit and debt limits; the crisis that erupted in Greece and other countries on the eurozone periphery in 2010; and the various bailouts that have followed.	此举的目的是为了解决欧洲的长期财政问题，且该财政问题已在以下三个因素的作用下加速恶化：自欧元诞生后覆盖欧元区的《稳定与增长公约》已经无法有效实施赤字与债务限制；2010年在希腊和一些欧元区外围国家爆发的经济危机；以及随后的各种救助行动。
There is no reason to doubt that the member states will follow through and adopt national rules by the end of the year.	毫无疑问，在年底之前各成员国都会跟进并颁布实施相关国家规定。
The problem is what comes after that: the risk that the fiscal compact will founder on precisely the same shoals as the SGP.	而问题在于随后发生的事情：财政契约的失败风险其实和《稳定与增长公约》是同样大的。
Ever since the eurozone was established, its members have issued official fiscal forecasts that are systematically biased in the optimistic direction.	自从欧元区建立以来，其成员国发布了一系列普遍偏向乐观的官方财政预测。
Other countries do this, too, but the bias among eurozone countries is, if anything, even worse than it is elsewhere.	当然其他国家也会如此，但如果说欧元区国家的预测有什么不同的话，那就是这种偏向实在是太离谱了。
During an economic expansion, such as in the 2002-2007 period, governments are tempted to forecast that the boom will continue indefinitely.	在经济扩张期间，比如2002到2007年，各国政府都倾向于预测经济繁荣会无限期持续下去。
Forecasts for tax revenue and budget surpluses are correspondingly optimistic and so hide the need for fiscal adjustment.	税收收入和预算盈余的预测都相对乐观，因而掩盖了财政调整的必要。
During a recession, such as in 2008-2012, governments are tempted to forecast that their economies and budgets will soon rebound.	在衰退期间，比如2008到2012年，各国政府都倾向于预测本国经济和预算都会很快回升。
Since forecasting is subject to so much genuine uncertainty, no one can prove that the forecasts are biased when they are made.	由于预测会受到很多不确定性因素的影响，在做预测时也没人能够证明那些预测有失偏颇。
But, if forecasts are biased, fiscal rules will not constrain budget deficits.	但由于预测有失偏颇，财政规定就不会对预算赤字进行限制。
In any given year, governments can forecast that their growth rates, tax revenues, and budget balances will improve in subsequent years, and then argue the following year that the shortfalls were unexpected.	在任何一年，政府都会预测本国增长率、税收收入及预算平衡将在未来几年有所上升，而在接下来的一年又会为自己辩护说那些不符合预期的差额是意外因素导致的。
Indeed, in a new paper, co-authored with Jesse Schreger, we show that eurozone members’ bias in official forecasts can be neatly characterized as responding to the SGP’s 3%-of-GDP limit on budget deficits in 1999-2011: each time governments exceeded the limit, over-optimistic forecasts followed.	确实，在笔者与杰西·施雷格（Jesse Schreger）合作撰写的新报告中，我们提出欧元区成员国在官方预测上的偏向性整齐划一地表现为对《稳定与增长公约》中1999-2011年财政赤字低于GDP3%条款的回应：每当政府预算赤字超过限制，就会出台过度乐观的预测。
In other words, governments adjust their forecasts, not their policies.	换句话说，各国政府调整的是其预测，而非政策。
Framing the budget rules in cyclical terms, while highly desirable in terms of its macroeconomic impact, does not help to solve the problem of forecast bias.	而周期性地调整财政限制制度尽管在其对宏观经济的影响方面非常有利，却无助于解决财政预测偏差的问题。
In fact, it can make the problem worse.	事实上，这只会让问题变得更严重。
In a year when a forecast for the structural budget deficit turns out to have been over-optimistic, the government can still claim that its own calculations show the shortfall to have been cyclical rather than structural.	对结构性预算赤字的预测被证明过度乐观的一年，政府依然可以声称其内部计算显示差额的出现是周期性而非结构性的。
After all, estimation of potential output – and hence the cyclical versus structural decomposition of the fiscal position – is notoriously difficult, even after the fact.	毕竟对潜在产出的估算 — — 从而对财政状况进行周期性或是结构性的解读 — — 是出了名的困难，即便是在事实之后计算也是如此。
Perhaps it will help that, under the fiscal compact, the rules are to be adopted at the national level, as opposed to the SGP, which operated on the supranational level.	也许在财政契约实施的情况下，它会有助于这些规则在国家层面上被采纳，而不像《稳定与增长公约》在超国家的层面上运作。
A look at the various rules and institutions that European countries have already tried shows that some work and others do not.	纵观欧洲国家已经尝试过的各种规则和机制我们就会知道，有些能起作用，有些则不能。
Creating an independent fiscal institution that provides its own budget forecasts works, insofar as it reduces the bias in deficit projections.	创建一个能自行做出预算预测的独立财政机构是可行的，因为它减少了赤字预算的偏差。
When forecasting while in violation of the eurozone’s Excessive Deficit Procedure, eurozone members with an independent budget-forecasting institution have a mean bias that is 2.7% of GDP smaller at the one-year horizon than members without such an institution.	当预测违反了欧元区的过度赤字程序机制时，拥有独立预算预测机构的欧元区成员国的一年期平均偏差比没有这类机构的成员国要小，且小于的幅度达到GDP的2.7 % 。
It would be better still if governments were legally bound to use these independent forecasts in their budget plans (borrowing an innovation from Chile).	如果各国政府能立法要求在其预算计划中必须使用这些独立预测的话则更好（这是从智利借鉴来的创新 ） 。
But, regardless of how well designed the rules are, clever and determined politicians can find ways around them.	但是，不管规则设计得多么巧妙，聪明而有决心的政治家都有办法绕过这些规则。
One trick is privatization of government enterprises, which reduces the budget deficit in a given year on a one-time basis, but might increase the deficit in the long run if the enterprise had been profitable.	其中一个窍门就是把政府企业私有化，这就减少了某年的预算赤字 — — 当然只能使用一次，但如果这个企业是盈利的话这也许会增加政府的长期赤字。
Another trick is to legislate tax cuts that are “temporary,” in order to make future revenues look larger, despite the intention to make the cuts permanent before they expire.	另一个窍门就是立法实施“暂时”的减税，这会使未来的收入看起来更多 — — 尽管其意图是维持减税直到该法律失效为止。
Other things being equal, the right institutions can curbpro-cyclical fiscal policies – tax cuts and spending hikes during booms and austerity during downturns – in the short run, while helping to deliver debt sustainability in the long run.	在其他条件不变的情况下，好的机构可以在短期内遏制那些以周期性为幌子的财政政策 — — 经济繁荣时期减税并增加支出，经济低迷时期实施财政紧缩 — — 并在长期内有助于实现债务可持续性。
These institutions include independent fiscal-forecasting agencies, combined with the cyclically adjusted budget targets that the eurozone’s fiscal compact mandates.	这些机构包括独立的财政预测机构，并与由欧元区财政契约授权的周期调整预算目标相结合。
Much can go wrong even if such mechanisms are in place; but, as the history of the SGP illustrates, the risk is higher if they are not.	虽然即使具备这样的机制也很可能出错；但正如《稳定与增长公约》的历史表明的那样，如果没有这样的机制，出错的风险将会更高。
	
Will Ex-Mexicans Choose America’s Next President?	墨西哥移民是否选择美国的下任总统？
Among the many surprises during the Republican Party presidential candidates’ debates a couple of weeks ago was the rekindled importance of immigration.	几个星期前共和党总统侯选人辩论中出现的众多惊奇之一就是重新触及了移民的重要性。
After the failure of President George W. Bush’s and Senator Edward Kennedy’s comprehensive immigration reform effort last spring, most observers thought the matter would remain dormant until 2009, since even touching it was potentially fatal for Democrats and Republicans alike.	去年秋天布什总统和肯尼迪参议员的全面移民改革失败以来，大多数观察家认为这一事情将会在2009年以前搁置起来，因为即使是触及此事也会对民主和共和两党是潜在致命的。
But as Democrats discovered in other recent debates, and as Republicans realized with a little help from the CNN organizers, who skewed the questions toward issues they feel strongly about, immigration is an issue that just won’t go away.	但是正如民主党人在最近的辩论中所发现的以及共和党人在有线电视新闻网组织者帮助下认识到的那样，移民问题是一个挥之不去的问题。 这些电视台组织者拼命对那些他们有强烈感觉的问题提出问题。
This is one reason why I wrote a short but – I hope – useful book on Mexican immigration to the United States, entitled Ex-Mex: From Migrants to Immigrants .	这就是为什么我写一本短小但是希望是有用的有关墨西哥人移民美国的书。 这本书的名字叫<<原墨西哥人：从移居者到移民>>。
Based on internal documents from the Mexican and US governments, countless interviews, and a survey of much of the existing literature on the subject, Ex-Mex seeks to fulfill three purposes.	这本书力图根据墨西哥和美国两国政府的内部文件、数不清的采访以及对这一问题现有的文献调查来达到三个目的。
First, I wanted to provide a Mexican voice in the immigration debate.	第一，我想要在移民问题辩论中提出墨西哥的声音。
Mexicans make up more than half of the flow and stock – legal or not – of all immigrants in the US, but a point of view attempting to reflect their interests and aspirations has been largely absent from the American discussion.	墨西哥人在美国的所有合法或非法移民移动和总量上占据一半以上，但是在美国人的辩论中却基本上一直没有试图反映墨西哥人利益以及渴求的观点。
Of course, my book cannot be the Mexican stance.	当然，我的书并不能成为墨西哥的立场。
But an assessment from the vantage point of past, current, and future Mexican immigrants to the US is a necessary component of the American debate – all the more so when one recalls that immigration has, in fact, not generally been exclusively a domestic US policy question.	但是分析过去、现在以及将来墨西哥到美国的移民的观点却是美国人辩论的一个必要的组成部分。 实际上，如果人们记得移民一直并不是单纯的美国国内政策问题，这一点就更为如此了。
The first American immigration agreement with another country was signed in 1907 – the so-called Gentleman’s Agreement with Japan, while the US and Mexico negotiated and administered the Bracero Program for more than twenty years, from 1942 thru 1964.	美国与外国签订的第一个移民协议是在1907年，也就是与日本签订的所谓君子协定。 从1942年到1964年，美国和墨西哥在二十多年的时间里谈判并执行了短工项目。
And, of course, the US has had a standing immigration agreement since 1965 with a country most Americans would not imagine: Fidel Castro’s Cuba.	当然，美国自1965年以来与一个大多数美国人难以想像的国家即卡斯特罗统治下的古巴一直保持一项移民协议。
Second, it is important to place the current, raging debate in historical context.	第二，把当前情绪化的辩论放置在历史的角度非常重要。
The most important feature of that context is that the actual flow of Mexicans entering the US today is not much greater than the overall average figure for the Bracero Program period: around 400,000 per year.	最为重要的特点就是今天实际进入美国的墨西哥人数量远远大于短工项目期间的总体平均数量，也就是每年40万人左右。
It is similarly important to understand the evolution of US legislation on immigration since the 1920’s, and the shifts and hypocrisy involved in the application of those laws.	同样重要的是理解自二十世纪二十年代以来美国移民立法上的变迁以及在执行这些法律上的变化和伪善。
For example, the 1996 immigration reforms implemented by the Clinton administration, along with other, underlying structural trends, halted the traditional circular pattern whereby Mexicans came and went to the US every year.	例如，由克林顿政府在1996年实行的移民改革与其他基本的结构性趋势一样停止了墨西哥人传统上每年往返美国的循环模式。
Instead, they began to settle in communities farther from the border, greatly increasing the stock of Mexicans in the US.	相反，他们开始远离边界社区，从而大幅度增加了美国的墨西哥人数量。
Finally, the efforts of the Mexican and US governments since 2001 to reach an accommodation on the issue have not been well understood.	最后，人们还没有很好地理解墨西哥和美国两国政府自2001年以来试图达成移民问题的努力。
Confidential papers from the Bush and Fox administrations show that talks went further than previously known.	布什政府和福克斯政府的机密文件显示，会谈进行的要比原来知道的要深入。
The US, and particularly then-Secretary of State Colin Powell, was willing, as stated in a unclassified memo addressed to Bush in late August 2001, to go to great lengths to reach an understanding with Mexico on the issue.	根据2001年8月底向布什提交的一份解密的备忘录所称，美国政府特别是国务卿鲍威尔愿意尽力与墨西哥在这一问题上达成谅解。
Indeed, the substance of the negotiations was not much different from the content of the Bush-Kennedy “grand bargain” that was fashioned in 2007.	实际上，谈判的实质内容与布什肯尼迪在2007年提出的“大赦”并没有多大区别。
The electoral numbers perhaps best explain the immigration equation’s importance in today’s presidential campaigns.	选民数量可能最好解释当今总统竞选中移民问题的重要性。
In 2008, it is likely that Latinos will make up 9% to 10% of the electorate, the highest share ever.	在2008年，拉美族裔人口有可能占据选举人口的9%到10 % ， 这是有史以来最高的。
They will wield decisive importance in swing states like Colorado, New Mexico, Florida, and Nevada.	他们将会在科罗拉多、新墨西哥、佛罗里达以及内华达等摇摆不定的州发��决定性的作用。
Having made significant inroads among Hispanic voters in 2000 and 2004, thanks to Bush’s support for immigration reform, Republicans now can barely count on 20% of that total – mainly among Cuban-Americans – thanks to their strident anti-immigration stance.	由于布什支持移民改革，共和党在2000年和2004年在拉美选民中取得重大进步。 由于共和党人强硬的反移民立场，他们现在只能指望这一总数的20 % ， 主要是在古巴美国人中。
Thus, if the Democrats demonstrate a minimum of compassion, sensitivity, and realism, they can count on a 7% advantage in the popular vote.	这样，如果民主党表现出最低程度的同情、敏感以及现实主义，那么他们就可以在全民投票中得到7%的优势。
But doing so could cost Democrats dearly in old industrial states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan, where the arrival of Mexican migrants, transformed into immigrants, has stoked passions.	但是这样做有可能在宾夕法尼亚、俄亥俄以及密西根等老的工业州让民主党付出代价。 在那些地方，墨西哥的移居者转变成为移民燃起了热情。
Since the Democrats’ victory will most likely depend on these states, the Democratic candidate who can square this circle, or the Republican who can break it, may well win the presidency.	由于民主党的胜利最需要依靠这些州，那些能够在移民问题上获得成功的民主党人或者打破这一问题包围的共和党人就有可能赢得总统大选胜利。
	
Will Global Imbalances Return?	全球失衡会重现吗？
BEIJING – Future history books, depending on where they are written, will take one of two approaches to assigning blame for the world’s current financial and economic crisis.	北京－未来的历史书籍，由于写作地点的不同，会采用下述两种方式中的一种，来归咎当前世界金融和经济危机的责任。
One approach will blame lax regulation, accommodating monetary policy, and inadequate savings in the United States. The other, already being pushed by former and current US officials like Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke, will blame the immense pool of liquidity generated by high-savings countries in East Asia and the Middle East.	历史书籍两种归责方式中的一种，会将当前的金融和经济危机归咎于美国松懈的监管、没有原则的货币政策以及储蓄不足；另一种 — — 像格林·斯潘和本·伯南克这样的前任美联储官员和现任美联储官员已经强调了这种方式，会将当前的金融和经济危机归咎于东亚和中东的高储蓄国家制造的巨大流动性。
All that liquidity, they will argue, had to go somewhere. Its logical destination was the country with the deepest financial markets, the US, where it raised asset prices to unsustainable heights.	他们认为，所有这些流动性都去了某个地方，其合理的目的地就是拥有最复杂的金融市场的美国，并且在进入美国之后将美国的资产价格抬升到了无法持续的高度。
Note the one thing on which members of both camps agree: the global savings imbalance – low savings in the US and high savings in China and other emerging markets – played a key role in the crisis by allowing Americans to live beyond their means.	请注意，上述两个阵营的人对这个观点达成了共识：即全球储蓄失衡 — — 美国的低储蓄和中国及其他新兴市场的高储蓄 — — 使美国人过上一种本身无法承受的生活，这对经济危机的发生起到了关键作用。
It encouraged financiers desperate to earn a return on abundant funds to put them to more speculative use.	这种全球储蓄失衡，促使金融家为了获得收益，不顾一切地将大量资金投入到越来越具有投机性的用途中去。
If there is a consensus on one issue, it is the impossibility of understanding the bubble and the crash without considering the role of global imbalances.	如果说人们已经在某个问题上达成了共识的话，这个问题就是，如果不考虑全球失衡的作用，要想理解资产泡沫和经济危机是不可能的。
Preventing future crises similar to this one therefore requires resolving the problem of global imbalances.	因此，要预防将来发生类似的经济危机，我们就要解决全球失衡的问题。
Here, the early signs are reassuring.	在这里，事情发展的初步迹象是令人欣慰的。
American households are saving again.	美国家庭再次开始储蓄了。
The US trade deficit has declined from $60 billion a month to just $26 billion, according to the most recent data.	根据最新的数据，美国的贸易逆差已经从每月600亿美元下降到每月只有260亿美元了。
As a matter of simple arithmetic, we know that the rest of the world is running correspondingly smaller surpluses.	只要我们进行一个简单的算术运算，就知道世界其他地区的贸易顺差相应地减少了。
But once American households rebuild their retirement accounts, they may return to their profligate ways.	但是，一旦美国家庭重新充实了他们的退休账户，他们就有可能回到挥霍的老路上去。
Indeed, the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve are doing all they can to pump up US spending.	事实上，奥巴马政府和美联储都在竭尽所能地提振美国消费。
The only reason the US trade deficit is falling is that the country remains in a severe recession, causing US imports and exports to collapse in parallel.	美国贸易逆差减少的唯一原因是美国仍然处在严重的衰退之中，而衰退又导致美国的出口和进口同时减少。
With recovery, both may recover to previous levels, and the 6%-of-GDP US external deficit will be back.	随着经济的复苏，美国的出口和进口都有可能恢复到以前的水平，占美国GDP6％的国际收支赤字会再次出现。
In fact, there has been no change in relative prices or depreciation of the US dollar of a magnitude that would augur a permanent shift in trade and spending patterns.	事实上，美元相对价格的变化，或者是美元的贬值，都没有达到足以预示国际贸易和消费模式会发生永久性转变的程度。
Whether there is a permanent reduction in global imbalances will depend mainly on decisions taken outside the US, specifically in countries like China.	全球失衡是否会有永久性的减少主要取决于美国之外的国家的决策，具体来说，就是像中国这样的国家的决策。
One’s forecast of those decisions hinges, in turn, on why these other countries came to run such large surpluses in the first place.	反过来，人们要预测这些国家会作出什么决策，其关键在于首先要知道，这些国家为什么要保持这么巨额的贸易顺差。
One view is that their surpluses were a corollary of the policies favoring export-led growth that worked so well for so long. China’s leaders are understandably reluctant to abandon a tried-and-true model.	一种观点认为，这些��家的顺差是长期以来运行良好的鼓励以出口为导向的经济增长模式的政策的必然结果。 中国的领导人不愿意放弃一个经过检验的模式，是可以理解的。
They can’t restructure their economy instantaneously.	他们不能瞬间改变中国的经济结构。
They can’t move workers from painting children’s toys in Guangdong to building schools in Western China overnight.	他们也无法在一夜之间，将在广东给儿童玩具上色的工人转移到中国西部建造学校。
They need time to build a social safety net capable of encouraging Chinese households to reduce their precautionary saving.	他们需要时间来建立一个能够鼓励中国家庭减少预防性储蓄的社会保障网络。
If this view is correct, we can expect to see global imbalances re-emerge once the recession is over and to unwind only slowly thereafter.	如果这种观点是正确的，我们就可以预期，一旦经济衰退结束，我们又会看到全球失衡再次出现，而且此后只能慢慢调整这种失衡。
The other view is that China contributed to global imbalances not through its merchandise exports, but through its capital exports.	另一种观点认为，中国不是通过其商品出口造成了全球失衡，而是通过其资本输出造成了全球失衡。
What China lacked was not demand for consumption goods, but a supply of high-quality financial assets.	中国缺乏的不是对消费品的需求，而是对高质量的金融资产的供应。
It found these in the US, mainly in the form Treasury and other government-backed securities, in turn pushing other investors into more speculative investments.	中国在美国找到了自己缺乏的高质量的金融资产 — — 这些金融资产主要表现为美国国债和其他政府证券，而这又促使其他投资者进行更为投机的投资活动。
Recent events have not enhanced the stature of the US as a supplier of high-quality assets.	最近的经济危机并没有提升美国作为高质量的金融资产提供者的形象。
And China, for its part, will continue to develop its financial markets and its capacity to generate high-quality financial assets internally.	而在中国方面，中国会继续发展其金融市场以及提供高质量的国内金融资产的能力。
But doing so will take time. Meanwhile, the US still has the most liquid financial markets in the world.	但是，中国要实现这一点需要时间，同时，美国仍然拥有世界上流动性最好的金融市场。
This interpretation again implies the re-emergence of global imbalances once the recession ends, and their very gradual unwinding thereafter.	这样的阐释再次暗含着，一旦经济衰退结束，全球失衡就会重现，在此之后对其的调整也很漫长。
One development that could change this forecast is if China comes to view investing in US financial assets as a money-losing proposition.	有一种变化能够改变这种预期，即中国认为投资美国金融资产是一个赔钱的买卖。
US budget deficits as far as the eye can see might excite fear of losses on US Treasury bonds.	就目前而言，美国的预算赤字可能会引起中国对投资美国国债亏损的担忧。
A de facto policy of inflating away the debt might stoke such fears further.	美国事实上的通过通货膨胀抵消债务的政策，会进一步强化中国的这种恐惧。
At that point, China would pull the plug, the dollar would crash, and the Fed would be forced to raise interest rates, plunging the US back into recession.	届时，中国就会撤出投资，美元就会崩溃，美联储就可能被迫提高利率，进而使美国经济再次陷入衰退。
There are two hopes for avoiding this disastrous outcome.	对避免这种灾难性的后果，存在两个希望。
One is relying on Chinese goodwill to stabilize the US and world economies. The other is for the Obama administration and the Fed to provide details about how they will eliminate the budget deficit and avoid inflation once the recession ends.	一个希望是希望中国具有稳定美国和世界经济的善意，另一个是希望奥巴马政府和美联储提供有关一旦经济衰退结束，他们会怎样消除预算赤字并避免通货膨胀的详情。
The second option is clearly preferable.	显然，第二种选择更可取。
After all, it is always better to control one’s own fate.	毕竟，掌握自己的命运总是比依靠别人要好。
	
Will Governmental Folly Now Allow for a Cyber Crisis?	政府的愚蠢能否立即导致一场网络危机？
CAMBRIDGE – When the financial crisis of 2008 hit, many shocked critics asked why markets, regulators, and financial experts failed to see it coming.	剑桥 — — 2008年金融危机来袭时，很多大吃一惊的批评家们质问为什么市场、监管机构和金融专家未能预见到这场危机。
Today, one might ask the same question about the global economy’s vulnerability to cyber-attack.	今天，人们或许会对全球经济面对网络攻击时的脆弱性提出同样的问题。
Indeed, the parallels between financial crises and the threat of cyber meltdowns are striking.	其实，金融危机和网络崩溃这两种威胁之间惊人的相似。
Although the greatest cyber threat comes from rogue states with the capacity to develop extremely sophisticated computer viruses, risks can also come from anarchistic hackers and terrorists, or even from computer glitches compounded by natural catastrophe.	虽然最大的网络威胁来源于有能力研发复杂计算机病毒的流氓国家，但风险也同样来自于信奉无政府主义的黑客和恐怖分子，甚至可能来自于因自然灾害而加剧的电脑故障。
A few security experts have voiced great alarm, including, most recently, Jonathan Evans, the head of the British Security Service (MI5).	不止一位安全专家都发出了严正警告，包括不久前英国安全局（军情五处）的负责人乔纳森·埃文斯。
By and large, however, few leaders are willing to compromise growth in the tech sector or the Internet in any significant way in the name of a threat that is so amorphous.	但总的来讲，很少有领导人愿意因为这样一种难以名状的威胁而明显放缓科技领域或互联网的发展速度。
Instead, they prefer to establish relatively innocuous working groups and task forces.	反之，他们更愿意组建相对无伤大雅的特遣队和工作组。
It is difficult to overstate the dependence of modern economies on large-scale computer systems.	人类几乎不可能夸大现代经济对大型计算机系统的依赖程度。
But imagine if one day a host of key communications satellites were incapacitated, or the databases of major financial systems were erased.	但想象一下如果哪天某台管理关键通信卫星的主机瘫痪无法工作，或者主要金融系统中的数据库遭到删除。
Experts have long identified the electricity grid as the most acute vulnerability, since any modern economy would collapse without power.	电网早就被专家认定为最严重的漏洞，因为一旦供电被切断，任何现代经济都会陷入崩溃。
True, many skeptics argue that with reasonable low-cost prophylactic measures, large scale cyber-meltdowns are highly implausible, and that doom-mongers overstate the worst-case scenarios.	当然，很多怀疑论者提出只要采取低成本的合理预防措施，大规模网络崩溃的可能性非常之低，末日论者夸大了可能出现最坏情况。
They say that the ability of cyber-terrorists and blackmailers to take the global economy to the brink, as in the 2007 Bruce Willis movie Die Hard 4, is utterly fictional.	他们表示网络恐怖分子和恐吓勒索者再现2007年布鲁斯·威利斯电影《虎胆龙威4》中的恐怖一幕，将全球经济推向崩溃边缘的能力完全是虚构的。
It is difficult to judge who is right, and there are important experts on both sides of the debate.	辩论的正反两方都有重量级的专家，很难判断哪一方的观点更加贴近事实。
But there do seem to be an uncomfortable number of similarities between the political economy of cyberspace regulation and of financial regulation.	但是，网络空间监管和金融监管的政治经济之间的确存在着令人不安的相似之处。
First, both cyber-security and financial stability are extremely complex topics with which government regulators can hardly keep up.	首先，网络安全和金融稳定都是极为复杂的课题，政府监管部门想要完全跟上它们的发展有些力不从心。
Industry remuneration for experts is far in excess of any public-sector salary, and the best minds are continually bid away.	从业专家的报酬远远超过任何公共部门的工资，而顶尖的人才不断地被吸引过去。
As a result, some argue that the only solution is reliance on self-regulation by the software industry.	因此有人认为，唯一的办法是依赖软件业的自我调节机制。
One hears this argument for many modern industries, from big food to big pharma to big finance.	人们在许多现代工业中都��听到这种说法，从大型食品到大型制药再到大型金融公司。
Second, like the financial sector, the tech industry is enormously influential politically through contributions and lobbying.	其次，像金融业一样，高科技行业通过捐款和游说拥有了巨大的政治影响力。
In the United States, all presidential candidates must make pilgrimages to Silicon Valley and other tech centers to raise money.	美国的所有总统候选人必须到硅谷和其他高科技中心去朝圣筹资。
Excessive financial-sector influence was, of course, a root cause of the 2008 meltdown and remains deeply implicated in today’s continuing eurozone mess.	金融部门影响过大无疑是2008年危机的根本原因，而且在今天的欧元区乱象中仍然脱不了干系。
Third, with slowing growth in advanced economies, information technology seems to hold the moral high ground, just as finance did until five years ago.	第三，随着先进经济体增长放缓，就像五年前的金融业那样，道德的制高点似乎被信息业所占据。
And crude attempts by governments to enforce regulation are likely to prove ineffective in protecting against catastrophe, while all too effective in strangling growth.	事实证明政府执行监管的粗暴尝试可能无法防止灾难的发生，但在扼杀经济增长方面却收效显著。
In both cases – financial stability and cyber security – the risk of contagion creates a situation in which a wedge can form between private incentives and social risks.	在金融稳定和网络安全两大课题下，蔓延的危险造成了私人激励和社会风险机制的分离。
Admittedly, progress in the technology sector overall often produces huge social-welfare gains, which arguably outstrip those produced by all other sectors in recent decades.	诚然，技术领域的总体进展往往能产生巨大的社会福利效益，这种效益甚至可能超过近几十年来所有其他行业的总和。
But, just as with nuclear power plants, progress can go awry in the absence of good regulation.	但正如核电厂一样，缺乏良好的监管可能导致在进展的过程中出现差错。
Finally, the greatest risks come from arrogance and ignorance, two human characteristics at the heart of most financial crises.	最后，最大的风险来自于傲慢和无知，这两种人性的弱点一直处在多数金融危机的核心位置。
Recent revelations about the super-viruses “Stuxnet” and “Flame” are particularly disconcerting.	最近关于超级病毒Stuxnet和火焰（Flame）的披露尤其令人不安。
These viruses, apparently developed by the US and Israel to disrupt Iran’s nuclear program, embody a level of sophistication far beyond anything previously seen.	这些病毒似乎由美国和以色列研发用于破坏伊朗的核计划，体现出远超之前记录的先进水平。
Both are deeply encrypted and difficult to detect once inside a computer.	这两种病毒均经过深度加密，一旦输入计算机就很难被发现。
The Flame virus has the capacity to take over a computer’s peripherals, record Skype conversations, take pictures through a computer’s camera, and transmit information via Bluetooth to any nearby device.	火焰病毒能够接管计算机的外围设备、Skype通话记录、借助电脑摄像头拍照，并通过蓝牙设备向任何邻近设备传输信息。
If the world’s most sophisticated governments are developing computer viruses, what guarantee is there that something won’t go awry?	如果世界上最先进的政府都在研制计算机病毒，那么还有什么能够保证不会出现差错？
How can we be sure that they won’t “escape” and infect a much broader class of systems, or be adopted for other uses, or that future rogue states or terrorists won’t find a way to turn them on their creators?	我们怎能肯定它们不会“泄露”并感染更大范围的系统，或者被转作其他用途，再或者未来的无赖国家或恐怖分子不会利用它们反过来攻击它们的创造者？
No economy is more vulnerable than the US, and it is arrogance to believe that US cyber superiority (to all except perhaps China) provides it with impenetrable security from attack.	没有哪国经济比美国更加脆弱，认为美国（对除中国之外所有国家）的网络优势在攻击面前坚不可摧仅仅是傲慢而已。
Unfortunately the solution is not so simple as just building better anti-virus programs.	不幸的是，解决办法不是编写更好的防病毒程序那么简单。
Virus protection and virus development constitute an uneven arms race.	病毒防护和病毒开发构成了一场不平衡的军备竞赛。
A virus can be just a couple hundred lines of computer code, compared to hundreds of thousands of lines for anti-virus programs, which must be designed to detect wide classes of enemies.	病毒可能仅仅是几百行计算机代码，但防毒程序的长度却至少成千上万，因为防毒程序的设计必须能够发现各式各样的敌人。
We are told not to worry about large-scale cyber meltdowns, because none has occurred, and governments are being vigilant.	我们被告知不用担心大规模的网络崩溃，因为政府会时刻保持警惕，而且这样的网络崩溃还从未发生过。
Unfortunately, another lesson of the financial crisis is that most politicians are congenitally incapable of making difficult choices until risks actually materialize.	不幸的是金融危机的另一个教训是，多数政客命中注定无法在风险实际兑现前作出艰难的抉择。
Let us hope that we are lucky for a while longer.	我们只能希望能够幸运更长一段时间。
	
Will Hamas Win the Peace?	哈马斯会赢得和平吗？
WASHINGTON, DC –For generations to come, the Palestinians will remember the horrific war in Gaza with pain and bitterness.	华盛顿特区－接下来的几代巴勒斯坦人都会充满痛苦地记住可怕的加沙战争。
But what cannot yet be seen is how Palestinians will view Hamas.	但是，巴勒斯坦人会怎样看待哈马斯，仍然有待观察。
Whether Hamas can claim a victory – and whether Palestinians will believe them will be determined by the type of ceasefire that is eventually agreed, if a formal one is eventually agreed.	哈马斯是否能获胜，以及巴勒斯坦人是否信任他们要取决于最终达成的停火的种类 — — 如果最终达成了正式停火协议的话。
The end game – for both Israel and Hamas – is thus crucially important.	因此，对以色列和哈马斯来说，战争的结局都是至关重要的。
For the moment, Hamas is perceived by the majority of Palestinians as the victim of a war intended to gain its surrender.	当前，大多数巴勒斯坦人将哈马斯看作是一场为了使哈马斯投降的战争的受害者。
After all, Hamas was democratically elected, but was forbidden from ruling and besieged in Gaza.	毕竟，哈马斯是民主当选的，但是，却被禁止在加沙进行统治，而且还被包围。
At the same time, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is accused of siding with Israel in order to restore his lost authority in Gaza.	同时，许多巴勒斯坦人指责巴勒斯坦民族权力机构主席穆罕默德·阿巴斯为了恢复其在加沙失去的威信，而支持以色列。
The war exposed flaws in Hamas’ judgment.	这次战争暴露了哈马斯判断的失误。
Hamas apparently did not envision a full-scale confrontation with Israel when it refused to renew a six-month truce.	当哈马斯拒绝续订六个月的休战协定时，它显然没有预想到会和以色列进行全面的对抗。
With Gaza suffering under a lengthy siege, Hamas leader Khalid Mashal said that there was no point in a new truce, since the old one had “failed to lift the siege on Gaza.”	在加沙遭到长时间的封锁时，哈马斯领导人卡里德·马舍尔（Khalid Mashal）声称，因为老停火协议“没能解除对加沙的封锁 ” ， 所以没有订立新停火协议的必要。
Other leaders were quoted as saying that Hamas would “lift the siege by force.”	根据有人援引的哈马斯其他领导人的说法，哈马斯会“使用武力解除封锁 ” 。
If Hamas is to survive the war, it must demonstrate that its resistance resulted in a permanent opening of Gaza’s border crossings, especially in Rafah.	如果哈马斯要在此次战争中幸存下来，它必须证明其抵抗在加沙边境地带，特别是在拉法（Rafah ） ， 形成了一个永久性的通路。
For Palestinians, these are signs of victory.	对巴勒斯坦人来说，这些都是成功的标志。
With open borders, Hamas would secure its regime in Gaza and build its popularity in the West Bank, putting enormous pressure on Abbas, the leader of the rival Fatah movement, to accept a national unity government on terms set by Hamas.	随着边境的开放，哈马斯会巩固其在加沙的政权并建立其在约旦河西岸的声望，这会对竞争对手法塔赫运动的领导人阿巴斯形成巨大的压力，迫使其接受按照哈马斯确定的条件组成的全国统一政府。
Members of Fatah’s Central Committee are already accusing Abbas of supporting Israel in the fighting, of wanting to “return to Gaza on an Israeli tank.”	法塔赫中央委员会的成员已经开始指责阿巴斯在本次战争中支持以色列，想“坐在以色列的坦克上返回加沙 ” 。
Radical groups within Fatah are leaning toward an open alliance with Hamas.	法塔赫内部的激进团体，也想要和哈马斯公开结盟。
If Hamas comes out ahead, Abbas’s allies in other Palestinian factions will press him to accept Hamas and Islamic Jihad within the PLO.	如果哈马斯提前发表观点，阿巴斯在其他巴勒斯坦派别中的盟友就会向其施加压力，迫使其在巴勒斯坦解放组织内部接受哈马斯和伊斯兰圣战组织。
Egypt will have to backtrack on its rejection of Hamas in order to recover its image among the Arabs and to reduce tensions within Egyptian society.	埃及也将不得不为了恢复其在阿拉伯人中的形象和缓解埃及社会内部的紧张状态而放弃对哈马斯的抵制。
Pressure to integrate Hamas into Palestinian politics is also likely in some European capitals, particularly Paris and London, where some expressed opposition to isolating Hamas even before the war.	有些欧洲国家的政府，特别是巴黎和伦敦，也可能存在将哈马斯纳入巴勒斯坦政治的压力 — — 在巴黎和伦敦，有人甚至在战争爆发前就表示反对孤立哈马斯。
But if Israel forces Hamas to accept its conditions for border controls and a formal ceasefire, Hamas’s image as the guardian of Palestinian resistance will be severely damaged.	但是，如果以色列迫使哈马斯接受其边境控制和正式停火的条件，哈马斯作为巴勒斯坦抵抗运动守护人的形象就会遭到严重的破坏。
Palestinians will ask if it was really necessary to fight this war and pay such a high price.	巴勒斯坦人就会怀疑，是否真的有必要进行这场战争并付出如此高昂的代价。
Abbas will be able to argue that he advised Hamas to renew the truce and to end its missile fire on Israeli towns, but that Hamas insisted on exposing Palestinian civilians to devastation.	阿巴斯就可以声称，他已经建议哈马斯续订停火协议并结束对以色列城镇的导弹袭击，但是，哈马斯却坚持使巴勒斯坦平民遭受战争的荼毒。
One indicator to watch for: the length of that ceasefire.	对此次战争要关注的一个指标是：停火时间的长短。
Palestinians will recognize Hamas’s acceptance of a multi-year truce with Israel as a sign of defeat, which would also underscore Palestinian feelings of humiliation and abandonment.	巴勒斯坦人会将哈马斯接受与以色列达成为期几年的停火协议视为哈马斯战败的标志，而这也会增强巴勒斯坦人遭到羞辱和被抛弃了的感觉。
Hezbollah, despite its rhetoric, has taken no steps to support Hamas, and the Arab states seemed more than willing to support its defeat.	尽管发表了种种言论，但是真主党却没有采取措施支持哈马斯，而且，阿拉伯国家似乎非常乐意看到哈马斯失败。
It is in rebuilding Gaza that the stakes of the competition will increase.	哈马斯和阿巴斯竞争的厉害关系，在加沙战后重建中会增加。
Abbas, supported by the United States and the European Union, may have control over significant funding.	得到美国和欧盟支持的阿巴斯，可能对大量的资金有控制权。
The test for him will be to deliver quickly.	对阿巴斯的考验是快速分配资金进行重建。
Hamas will also have resources for reconstruction.	哈马斯也有进行重建的资源。
Qatar, a Hamas supporter, has already announced an investment fund for Gaza and contributed $250 million.	支持哈马斯的卡塔尔，已经宣布建立一个加沙投资基金，并且捐助了2.5亿美元。
Hamas will have to make a convincing case that Gaza’s near destruction is a price that had to be paid.	哈马斯必须提供有说服力的实例，来证明加沙的近乎毁灭是一个必须付出的代价。
Many Palestinians believe that Israel inflicted this damage on Gaza to drive a wedge between the people and the “resistance.”	许多巴勒斯坦人认为，以色列对加沙造成这样的破坏是为了分化巴勒斯坦人民和“抵抗运动 ” 。
There is a precedent for this argument: Hezbollah described the destruction of Beirut’s southern suburbs in exactly these terms at the end of the Lebanon War in July 2006.	这样的观点有一个先例可考：在2006年6月份黎巴嫩战争结束的时候，真主党将贝鲁特南部郊区遭到破坏，正是用这样的语言加以解释的。
More importantly, Hamas can demonstrate that its leaders have been on the front lines during this war, sharing Palestinian suffering; many have been killed, along with their families.	更重要的是，哈马斯可以证明在此次战争中，其领导人到战争前线参加战斗，分担巴勒斯坦人的痛苦；许多哈马斯成员和他们的家人一起牺牲了。
The biggest question is whether the war will alter Hamas’ political goals.	最大的问题是，此次战争是否会改变哈马斯的政治目标。
Two weeks ago, Musa Abu Marzouk, a senior Hamas official, praised Jimmy Carter in The Los Angeles Times as the only American president who had brought true peace in the Middle East.	两个星期前，哈马斯高级官员穆萨·阿卜·马祖卡（Musa Abu Marzouk）在《洛杉矶时报》上称赞吉米·卡特是给中东带来真正和平的唯一一位美国总统。
This is a radical departure from Hamas rhetoric, which has always portrayed the Camp David agreement between Israel and Egypt as a betrayal of the Islamic world.	这和哈马斯总是将以色列和埃及签订的戴维营协议描绘成为对伊斯兰世界的背叛的观点，有巨大的差异。
It remains to be seen whether Abu Marzouk’s view is merely a tactic intended to encourage the Obama administration to reach out to Hamas, or whether the war convinced Hamas that the two-state solution is the only viable option to settle the conflict with Israel.	阿卜·马祖卡（Musa Abu Marzouk）的观点是否只是一个为了刺激奥巴马政府接近哈马斯的策略，或者战争是否使哈马斯认识到两国共存方案是解决与以色列冲突的唯一可行选择，还有待观察。
	
The Framing of MH-17	MH-17事件的框架
PHILADELPHIA – US President Barack Obama called the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 an “outrage of unspeakable proportions,” whereas Russian President Vladimir Putin termed it an “accident” and a “terrible tragedy.”	费城 — — 美国总统奥巴马称马航17航班被击落所引发的“愤怒难以言表 ” ， 而俄罗斯总统普京则用“意外”和“可怕的悲剧”来形容。
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko branded it an “act of terrorism,” and Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak called it an “inhumane, uncivilized, violent, and irresponsible act.”	乌克兰总统波罗申科称之为一次“恐怖事件 ” ， 而马来西亚总理纳吉布·拉扎克则称上述行为“反人道、反文明、暴力且不负责任 。 ”
All of these descriptions may be accurate, but each carries different rhetorical weight and legal implications.	上述所有说法可能都有道理，但其修辞重点和法律内涵则各有不同。
The time has come for governments and international organizations to call the attack on MH17 a probable war crime.	政府和国际组织是时候将MH17遇袭事件定性为潜在的战争罪行。
This rhetorical shift is needed, first and foremost, because framing the moral reprehensibility of this despicable act within a common language will help to align public perceptions of it.	这种说法上的转变很有必要，因为用所有人都听得懂的语言指出这种卑劣行径的道德错误对统一公众看法很有帮助。
As it stands, the public narrative in Russia and the West diverges sharply.	目前俄罗斯和西方的公众说法截然不同。
Russian media and officials portray the episode as, at best, a terrible mistake, and, at worst, an American plot to undermine support for the rebels.	俄罗斯媒体和官员充其量把此次事件说成是可怕的错误，甚至说成是美国人削弱对叛军支持的阴谋。
Americans and Europeans, for their part, increasingly blame Russia for possibly equipping or assisting the rebels.	而美欧则越来越多地指责俄罗斯可能为叛军提供装备或者协助。
As a result, the possibility of achieving a common understanding of the act is being lost – and, with it, whatever potential there may be for meaningful cooperation.	结果是就上述行为达成共识的可能性越来越小 — — 开展有意义合作的机会也正在消失。
But, by recognizing the downing of MH17 as a war crime, governments may be able to create an opening to reconcile these narratives.	但如果认定击落MH17属于战争罪行，各国政府或许可以打破坚冰，统一态度。
Whatever the perpetrators’ underlying motives, there is no denying the moral and legal wrongdoing that occurred.	无论肇事者出于何种潜在动机，此次事件是道德和法律犯罪都是无可否认的。
Calling the offense by its legal name acknowledges this, thereby preempting a rhetorical battle to frame the attack as terror, tragedy, or conspiracy.	用合法名称来形容此次事件承认了这一基本事实，并对恐怖、悲剧和阴谋论进行了有力的反驳。
Even the Russians may be willing to accept this framing, because it avoids finger-pointing against particular actors and affirms that a court of law – not a series of media statements – will determine what occurred and who is responsible.	就连俄国人都有可能愿意接受这一框架，因为这样做避免了指责特定人员，并确保将由法院而不是媒体来决定事实真相和责任者。
In fact, another important reason to characterize the downing of MH17 publicly as a war crime is that it may prove beneficial in apprehending the perpetrators.	事实上，将击落MH17公开定性为战争罪的另一重要原因是这样做或许有利于逮捕肇事者。
There is a real danger that those responsible for pressing the launch button – and, perhaps, for ordering the launch – will disappear into the chaos of eastern Ukraine, the vast expanses of Russia, or elsewhere.	按下发射按钮 — — 或者也许是下达发射命令的人的确有可能消失在混乱的乌克兰东部和俄罗斯广袤的国土当中。
There is also a danger that the perpetrators, if found, might avoid trial if the local authorities label the crime political, and thus exempt from normal extradition requirements.	此外，还有可能即便找到了凶手，地方当局也会以政治犯罪为由让凶手逃避审判，避开正常的引渡请求。
All of the relevant states in the region have accepted the legal obligation to assist in the investigation and prosecution of war crimes.	该地区所有相关国家都认可协助战争罪调查和起诉的法律义务。
The obligation to prosecute suspected war criminals, or extradite them to face prosecution elsewhere, becomes more compelling in accordance with the seriousness of the alleged crime.	所谓战争罪越严重，起诉犯罪嫌疑人、或将其引渡到其他地方接受审判的义务就愈加引人注目。
While the full details of the attack on MH17 remain unknown, shooting a surface-to-air missile at a civilian airliner flying over a war zone is most likely a violation of the law of war – by which the Ukrainian government, the Russian government, and the rebels are all bound.	虽然MH17遇袭的全部细节尚不清楚，但用地空导弹袭击飞越战区上空的民航客机无疑违反了战争法 — — 乌克兰政府、俄罗斯政府和叛军均应受到该法的约束。
Indeed, the conflict in eastern Ukraine constitutes a non-international armed conflict (a war between a government and rebel movement) governed by international humanitarian law, which categorically bans the intentional targeting of civilians.	事实上，乌克兰东部冲突属非国际性武装冲突（政府和反叛运动作战）性质，需要遵守国际人道主义法，其中明确禁止蓄意袭击平民目标。
In other words, if whoever launched the missile did so with the intent of killing the civilian passengers aboard MH17, the act was unmistakably a war crime.	换句话说，如果导弹发射者想要杀害搭乘MH17的平民乘客，那么该行为明白无误属于战争罪的范畴。
Even if the objective was to strike a Ukrainian transport aircraft, the act likely constitutes a war crime.	即使原定目标是击落乌克兰运输机，上述行为仍有可能属于战争罪的范畴。
Fundamental to the law of war, including the law applicable in non-international armed conflicts, is the principle of distinction – the requirement that fighting parties distinguish between civilian and military targets.	战争法，包括非国际性武装冲突法的基本原则是要区别对待，要求交战方分清平民和军事目标。
In the words of the International Committee of the Red Cross, that duty of care includes doing “everything feasible to verify that targets are military objectives.”	用红十字国际委员会的话说，这项义务包括“尽一切可能确认目标是否是军事目标 。 ”
In this case, many steps could easily have been taken to differentiate MH17 from a military-transport plane, including visual identification (perhaps with binoculars), radar-signature analysis, and a check of the civilian aircraft transponder-code broadcast.	在这种情况下，有很多手段可以轻松区分MH17和军事运输机，其中包括视觉识别（或许采用双筒望远镜 ） 、 雷达信号分析和民用飞机应答码广播核查。
If, as seems likely, these basic steps were not taken, even an accidental strike on MH17 would constitute a war crime.	如果看似并未采取这些基本措施，那么即使误中MH17也有可能划入战争罪的范畴。
A Dutch or Malaysian court, or even a special tribunal under the auspices of the United Nations (like the one that prosecuted the 1988 Pan Am Lockerbie bombing), will ultimately determine who bears legal responsibility for the downing of MH17.	一家荷兰或马来西亚法院，甚或是联合国授权的一家特别法院（比如1988年起诉泛美洛克比空难的法院）将决定在法律层面谁来为击落MH17航班负责。
Framing the attack as a likely war crime now – as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay has done – may help to reconcile the conflicting narratives that are emerging.	像联合国高级人权专员皮莱那样将此次袭击作为潜在的战争罪行对待可能有助于统一不断出现的矛盾叙述。
And, perhaps more important, doing so can play a key role in securing the political, diplomatic, and legal support needed to bring the perpetrators to justice.	而且，更重要的是，这样做能在争取将肇事者绳之以法所需的政治、外交和法律支持中起到关键的作用。
	
China’s New Reforms in Theory and Practice	中国新改革：理论与实践
HONG KONG – On November 12, the Third Plenary of the 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) announced a major turn to market-oriented policies: interest-rate and currency liberalization, reform of banks and state enterprises, clearer land ownership for rural inhabitants, and a better deal for urban migrants.	香港—11月12日，中国十八大三中全会宣布了一组重大的市场化转向政策：利率和货币自由化、银行和国有企业改革、更清晰的农村居民土地所有权、以及更好的城市农民工待遇。
Behind this landmark decision was a potential crisis.	隐藏在这一划时代决定背后的是一场潜在危机。
China’s success has been driven by cheap exports based on cheap labor, infrastructure built by state enterprises with low-cost bank funding, and government budgets funded by land sales.	中国的成功一直是由基于廉价劳动力的廉价出口、廉价银行资金支持的国有企业建设的基础设施以及土地销售提供资金的政府预算推动的。
But labor is no longer cheap, road construction to connect major cities has given way to building large shopping malls in small towns, and land sales based on rezoning are reaching both economic limits and the limits of villagers’ tolerance.	但劳动力不再廉价、连接主要城市的道路建设已经变成了在小城镇建设大型购物城，基于重新规划的土地销售已经达到了经济和村民容忍力的双重极限。
Cheap money with limited investment outlets now risks fueling property bubbles and industrial overcapacity.	如今，廉价的资金加上投资渠道受限有可能助长房地产泡沫和工业产能过剩。
Without fundamental change, China faces slower economic growth, inadequate job creation and innovation, and popping bubbles.	如果没有根本性变化，中国面临着经济增速减慢、就业创造和创新不足和泡沫破裂的风险。
The solution is a rapid shift from China’s export-based growth model to one based on domestic demand; from infrastructure to consumption; from the dominance of large state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to that of small and medium-size private enterprises; from industry to services; and, more broadly, from bureaucratic control to market control.	解决办法在于迅速地从基于出口的增长模式转变为基于内需；从基础设施转变为消费；从大型国有企业主导转变为中小型民营企业；从工业转变为服务业；以及更广泛地，从官僚控制转变为市场控制。
All successful Asian countries have made this shift; South Korea and Taiwan are models.	所有亚洲成功经济体都做过这一转变；韩国和中国台湾堪称榜样。
But rapid change entails immense pain.	但快速变化意味着阵痛。
SOEs will lose their low-interest loans, subsidized land, monopoly protection, and privileged housing.	国有企业将失去低息贷款、受补贴土地、垄断保护和福利住房。
Party and state bureaucracies will lose power (and income).	党和国家官僚将失去权力（以及收入 ） 。
Local governments are particularly desperate.	地方政府尤其着急。
They have huge debts, which they amortize by rezoning and selling land.	它们背负着巨额债务，对于这些债务，它们通过再规划和销售土地摊销。
Already squeezed by exorbitant property prices and popular resistance to land takings, they now face higher interest rates, property taxes, villagers empowered by stronger rights, and expensive new requirements to provide social services to migrants.	除了房价过高、群众对征地的抵制之外，地方政府现在还面临利率提高、房产税、村民力量和权利增加以及为农民工提供社会保证的需要大笔开支的新要求。
The desperation of local potentates and SOE executives has created powerful resistance to reform.	地方执政者和国有企业掌门人的焦急构成了对改革的重大阻碍。
At a plenary reportedly marked by acrimony, China’s political leaders sided with reform.	据说三中全会中充满了斗争，最终中国政治领导人站在了改革一边。
As one economic planner said, when asked about resistance before the decisive meeting, “In the end, all of our leaders understand numbers.	一位经济计划官员在这次决定性会议前被问及遭遇的抵制时回答说 ： “ 说到底，我们的领导人都明白数字。
The implications of the numbers are clear.”	数字的影响力是毫不含糊的 。 ”
The Third Plenum’s announcement of its decisions took the form of a statement of broad principles, leaving many observers concerned by the lack of detail.	三中全会的决定以提纲挈领的形式公布，让许多观察者担心缺少细节。
But the CCP’s role is to set the direction of policy; executing the Party’s decisions is the government’s job.	但中共的角色是决定政策方向；执行党的决定是政府的责任。
And the Plenum did establish a top-level group to coordinate and enforce implementation of its decisions.	三中全会确实成立了顶层领导小组协调和强制其决定的实施。
While implementation will be a long struggle, with occasionally fierce resistance, key reforms are already underway.	实施将是一场长期斗争，会遇到一些激烈抵制，但关键改革已经上路。
The current 12th Five-Year Plan calls for annual wage increases to average at least 13.4%; this year, wages are rising at an average rate of 18%, which will squeeze out industries characterized by obsolescence or overcapacity.	当前的十二五规划要求工资增长平均至少为13.4 % ； 今年，工资增长平均率为18 % ， 这将挤压过时和产能过剩的行业。
Moreover, the government’s anti-corruption campaign is targeting some of the most powerful industry groups, such as the petroleum faction, thereby weakening their resistance to reform.	此外，政府的反腐运动将目标定向一些权力最大的工业集团，比如石化行业，从而削弱了对改革的抵制。
Most important, economic outcomes are becoming increasingly aligned with the authorities’ goals.	最重要的是，经济结果日益与当局的目标相一致。
Services already account for more output and employment than industry – the Internet company Alibaba, for example, is empowering both consumers and smaller companies on a previously unimaginable scale – and recent growth has been driven by domestic demand rather than net exports.	服务业对产出和就业的贡献已超过工业 — — 比如，互联网公司阿里巴巴以此前难以想象的规模壮大了消费者和小公司 — — 且近期的增长受内需而不是出口推动。
Reform is not just a plan; it is already happening.	改革不仅仅是计划，而是正在进行时。
Economic openings to Central Asia and to ASEAN (specifically to Vietnam) are well underway, and reform will include further international opening.	向中亚和东盟（特别是越南）开放经济也在积极展开，而改革将包括进一步的国际开放。
The Third Plenum’s decisions follow the launch in September of the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone, which will open new sectors to foreign investment and permit largely market-based financial transactions and capital flows.	在三中全会的决定之前，9月份在上海成立了自由贸易区，自贸区将向外国投资开放新部门，允许基本由市场决定的金融交易和资本流。
The liberalization of capital flows is intended to be a gradual national policy, channeled through trusted institutions in Shanghai.	资本流动自由化将成为常规国家政策，由上海的可信机构作为渠道。
For trade in goods, the new free-trade zone is intended to compete directly with Singapore and Hong Kong.	对于商品贸易，新自贸区将直接与新加坡与香港竞争。
China fears dependence on those entrepôts in the event of conflict.	中国担心在面临冲突事件时过度依赖香港和新加坡等中转站。
For foreign investors, the policy will be to expand greatly the range of opportunities while curtailing foreign control; foreign companies, for example, may hold minority stakes in the telecoms sector, while dominant foreign companies like Monsanto will face constraints.	对外国投资者来说，这一政策将极大地扩大机会，同时限制外国控制；比如，外国公司可以成为电信部门的少数股东，但孟山都等国际大公司将面临约束。
President Xi Jinping faces the politically risky task of pushing the CCP’s reform agenda against fierce opposition while the economy slows.	在经济放缓的背景下战胜反对者、推动中共的改革日程是习近平主席面临的高风险政治任务。
By emphasizing Party control – through a crackdown on SOEs, government opponents, and critics in the media and academia – Xi seeks to maximize his ability to impose economic reforms while minimizing the risk of a challenge from conservative forces.	习近平强调党的控制 — — 通过打压国有企业、政府反对派和媒体和学界的批评 — — 以此寻求推动改革能力最大化和保守派挑战风险最小化。
Above all, he is determined to avoid the fate of previous Chinese leaders like Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang, who lost their jobs after a critical mass of their opponents came to believe that economic and political reform jeopardized Party control.	总之，习近平要避免前任中国领导人胡耀邦和赵紫阳的命运。 胡耀邦和赵紫阳因为反对者认为经济和政治改革威胁到了党的控制而被迫下台。
So, at least for now, China will focus on another great wave of economic reform, whereas political reform will mostly be limited to reorganization of government agencies to boost efficiency and strengthen efforts to reduce corruption.	因此，至少从现在看，中国将专注于新一轮伟大的经济改革，而政治改革最有可能将局限于重组政府机构以增进效率以及打击腐败。
(There have been some steps toward reform, including a decision to remove judges from local political control.)	（改革之路已经跨出了一些步骤，包括取消地方政治控制法官。 ）
And yet China will find it increasingly difficult to postpone stronger measures that would appease popular demands for fairness, including the establishment of an independent judiciary, which could prove to be no less an imperative than structural economic reforms.	但中国将会发现，中止迎合公众对公正的要求的更强有力的措施将变得越来越困难，建立司法独立就是其中之一，这将是不亚于结构性经济改革的当务之急。
Likewise, the leaders must either accept much of the information revolution’s swamping of controls or engage in far more costly repression.	类似地，领导人要么接受信息革命对控制力的颠覆，要么实施代价高昂的打压。
Hopes for political reform rest on the possibility that Xi’s second term will see the accession to top leadership of reformers like Politburo member Wang Yang and Vice President Li Yuanchao.	政治改革的希望在于，在习近平的第二个任期，政治局委员汪洋和国家副主席李源潮等改革派能进入最高层。
For now, however, China will focus on another great wave of economic reform.	但是，眼下中国将专注于新一轮伟大的经济改革。
	
China’s Xi Factor	中国的习因素
HONG KONG – Before China’s leadership transition earlier this year, experts said that the Chinese Communist Party was intent on preventing a larger-than-life personality from assuming power.	香港—在今年早些时候中国领导层交接之前，专家们纷纷表示中共决意要避免英雄人物掌权。
The CCP, it was argued, wanted someone more like the bureaucratic outgoing leader, Hu Jintao, rather than a charismatic successor like, say, the former Chongqing provincial governor Bo Xilai.	他们指出，中共希望新领导人更像即将卸任的胡锦涛是一个官僚，而不要像前重庆市委书记薄熙来那样是一个强人。
Yet the new president and CCP leader, Xi Jinping, is hardly dull.	但新国家主席和中共总书记习近平绝非平庸之辈。
He began his term by paying homage to Deng Xiaoping at his statue in Shenzhen, where, more than three decades ago, the former Communist Party leader had launched the campaign to convert a reluctant Party to free-market reforms.	一上任他就前往深圳朝邓小平雕像致意，三十年前，作为前中共领导人的邓小平在深圳拉开了改革的序幕，让顽固的中共接受了自由市场。
In a top-level November meeting, Xi set out the details of a fundamental change in economic direction, overshadowing his colleagues.	在11月的顶层会议中，习近平制定了经济方向根本性变革的细节，光芒盖过了它的同事。
Xi now leads a new economic group that will coordinate and impose his reforms on fractious colleagues.	如今，习近平领导的新经济小组将协调他心存不满的同事，实施他的改革。
And, unlike Hu, he immediately became head of the military and now runs a parallel national security council.	与胡锦涛不同，习近平马上就成为军队首脑，现在还领导着国家安全委员会。
At first glance, a new “paramount leader” appears to be emerging.	咋一看，一位“最高领袖 ” （ paramount leader）正在冉冉升起。
Recent history explains this re-concentration of power.	近期历史解释了这一权力的再集中。
In 1993, central-government leaders enjoyed relatively limited powers: they did not control the money supply and had difficulty firing provincial governors or relocating top generals.	1993年，中央政府领导人的权力相对有限：他们控制不了货币供给，也很难更换省级领导人或高层军官。
Central government revenue was low; indeed, proportionately smaller than that of central governments in any other major economy.	中央政府收入很低；事实上，按比例计算，中国中央政府是主要经济体中规模最小的。
This changed when then-Party leader Jiang Zemin and his prime minister, Zhu Rongji, centralized authority in order to stave off economic crisis at a time of growing risk to China’s banks.	这一状况在时任总书记江泽民和国务院总理朱镕基任上发生了改变，江泽民和朱镕基通过权力集中避免了中国银行风险上升带来的经济危机。
In the process, the labor force of China’s state enterprises declined by 50 million, China lost 25 million manufacturing jobs, and central-government employment was slashed.	在此过程中，中国国有企业职工人数减少了5 000万，全国减少了2 500万个制造业岗位，中央政府工作人员数量也大幅下降。
These measures saved China’s economy, but at the price of widespread social stress, which made Zhu widely disliked when he left office.	这些措施挽救了中国经济，但代价是社会压力的全面增加，也导致朱镕基在离任后非常不受欢迎。
Popular reaction against the cosmopolitan, coastal, and market-oriented reforms of Zhu and Jiang brought to power leaders whose formative experiences were in the inland provinces of Gansu and Tibet.	针对朱镕基和江泽民的城市、沿海和市场导向改革的群众反对情绪带来的是从政经历来自内陆省份甘肃和西藏的领导人。
Riding a wave of resentment against inequality and social tensions, Hu and his prime minister, Wen Jiabao, promised a “harmonious society,” without the stresses of Zhu’s agenda.	面临对不平等性的怨恨和社会紧张局面的胡锦涛和他的总理温家宝提出了“和谐社会 ” 。 不再强调朱镕基的日程。
They slowed economic reform and ceased political reforms.	他们减缓了经济改革，暂停了政治改革。
The bureaucracy expanded from 40 million to 70 million, and power devolved to provinces, bureaucracies, and state-owned enterprises (SOEs).	官僚人数从4 000万膨胀到7 000万，权力则下放到各省、官僚机构和国有企业。
The somnolent Hu/Wen era, fortunately, did not dampen the economic growth triggered by the earlier reforms undertaken by Jiang and Zhu.	幸运的是，令人昏昏欲睡的胡温时代并没有让江朱时代实施的改革所开启的经济增长减慢速度。
But the economic-growth model that those reforms created was running out of steam.	但江朱改革所形成的经济增长模式正在失去动力。
Low-cost exports were struggling as labor costs rose.	随着劳动力成本���上升，低成本出口难以为继。
Investment in infrastructure was shifting from growth-enhancing projects, such as inter-city highways, to less productive shopping malls in second- and third-tier cities.	基础设施投资对象不再是城际高速公路等强化增长的项目，变成了生产率更低的二三线城市购物城。
Productivity plummeted in SOEs, whose privileged access to financing crowded out private-sector investment.	国有企业生产率大幅下降，同时它们优先获得融资的特权又挤出了私人部门投资。
Local-government funding, through the seizure and resale of property, was reaching its limits.	地方政府通过征地和卖地进行融资的做法也已经趋于极限。
Thus, it became essential to launch a new wave of far-reaching reforms, including liberalization of interest rates, securities markets, and foreign-exchange controls, in order to fund the more productive private sector and reduce excess capacity in SOEs.	于是，实施新一轮深层次改革就变得至关重要，包括利率、证券市场和外汇管制的自由化，这样才能为生产率更高的私人部门提供资金并削减国有企业的过剩产能。
In particular, the reforms were needed to deflate an emerging property bubble resulting from huge savings and foreign capital inflows that had no other profitable investment outlet.	特别地，中国需要改革抑制房地产泡沫。 房地产泡沫的罪魁是找不到其他可盈利投资渠道的巨额储蓄和外国资本流入。
The government planned to liberalize interest rates and the capital account to encourage investment in modern, high-value industries, rather than continue to subsidize low-value exports.	政府计划实施利率和资本账户自由化以鼓励对现代高价值行业的投资，不再继续补贴低价值出口部门。
It started to shift the economy’s base from export-oriented industries to domestic growth, and from manufacturing to services.	政府开始将经济的基础从出口导向型行业专项国内增长，从制造业专项服务业。
And it announced its intention to slow local governments’ seizures of farmland and excessive borrowing through captive enterprises.	政府还宣布将抑制地方政府征用农地和通过政府控制企业过度借贷。
Unsurprisingly, opposition to reform was implacable.	毫不奇怪，改革的反对之声不绝于耳。
SOEs were determined to defend their privileges.	国有企业决意捍卫它们的特权。
Highly leveraged local governments could not tolerate higher interest rates or an appreciating currency, and they were adamant about continuing land sales and opposing property taxes.	高杠杆的地方政府无法忍受提高利率或货币升值，坚持继续卖地和反对房产税。
They feared the financial burden of new requirements to provide social services to urban migrants.	它们担心向农民工提供社会服务的新要求所带来的财政负担。
As a result, a new, lean leadership team had to be mobilized.	因此一个精干的领导团队必须动员起来。
The number of top leaders was cut from nine to seven.	最高领导层人数从九人减少为七人。
The new lineup eliminated the most powerful voice on the left (Bo) and relegated the “extreme reformers” on the right (Li Yuanchao and Wang Yang) to the second tier.	新阵容排除了最强硬的左派（薄熙来 ） ， 而右派“极端改革者 ” （ 李源潮和汪洋）只能位居次等。
To reduce elders’ interference, Hu stepped down as head of the military and Jiang Zemin promised to step back.	为了减少老干部的干扰，胡锦涛卸任军队首脑，江泽民也承诺力挺习近平。
Moreover, a leading economic group was established to enforce bureaucratic compliance, as was a national security council (similar to that in the United States) to coordinate foreign policy.	此外，习近平成立了一个经济领导小组迫使官僚屈服，还成立了国家安全委员会（与美国国家安全委员会类似）协调外交政策。
Previously, the military often kept the foreign ministry in the dark; and the party’s foreign-affairs office, which handled North Korea, often failed to coordinate its activities with the foreign ministry, which handled South Korea.	此前，军方常常让外交部无所适从；而中共外事办公室（负责朝鲜事务）往往不能协调其与外交部（负责韩国事务）的行动。
An anti-corruption campaign weakened opposition, and Zhu re-emerged as a hero.	反腐行动减弱了改革的反对力量，朱镕基以英雄形象再次出现在公众视野。
This set the stage for Xi’s arrival.	这些都是在为习近平的上台铺路。
In short, the new-style leadership, a form of managed charisma, was collectively designed to serve national needs.	简言之，中共集体设计了一种新的领导风格 — — 有管理的领袖形式（managed charisma）来满足国家需要。
And it implies that Xi is unlikely to emerge as paramount leader.	这意味着习近平不可能成为最高领袖。
The Chinese presidency’s authority has certainly increased; but Xi is powerful only when he has the votes.	中国国家主席的权威显然增加了，但习近平只有在掌握选票的情况下才能得到权力。
On contentious issues, he has but one of seven.	在存在争议的问题上，他只是七人中的一人。
	
Desperate Women’s Dangerous Moves	绝望女性的危险运动
GENEVA – One of the most significant recent trends in migration has been the rise in the number of women using dangerous routes previously used mainly by men.	日内瓦—当前移民活动的一个重大趋势是越来越多的女性采用了此前主要由男性采用的危险办法。
More and more women – fleeing discrimination, violence, or poverty – are now taking the same risks as men in search of a better life for themselves and their children.	越来越多的女性为了摆脱歧视、暴力或贫困而甘愿像男性一样冒险为自己和孩子争取更好的生活。
This is desperation migration.	这就是绝望的移民。
Indeed, while many women travel with their families, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) is seeing an increasing number of women migrating on their own to an unknown, unpredictable, and often dangerous future.	事实上，尽管许多女性跟随家庭迁徙，但国际移民组织（IOM）发现独立地为了未知的、不可预测的并且往往是很危险的未来而移民的女性数字正在增加。
Women and children migrants are dying with increasing frequency at sea, crossing deserts, and on other hazardous routes.	女性和儿童移民越来越多地丧生于渡海、穿越沙漠和其他危险途径中。
What has changed?	是什么发生了改变？
Among the many factors pushing women to migrate are pervasive gender bias and social prejudices against single mothers or widows in their country of origin.	促使女性移民的因素包括原住地无处不在的针对单身母亲或寡妇性别歧视和社会偏见。
But poverty is almost always the strongest force driving women to leave.	但贫困几乎永远是促使女性迁徙的最重要动力。
In most poor countries, women are poorer than men, owing to the systematic discrimination that they face in education, health care, employment, and control of assets.	在大部分穷国，女性比男性更穷，这是因为她们在教育、医疗、就业和资产控制中处于系统性的被歧视地位。
Of course, most migrant women do not encounter mistreatment or die on their journeys; in fact, many derive real benefits from migration.	当然，大部分女性移民在迁徙过程中没有遇到虐待或死亡；事实上，许多人因为移民而境况大为改善。
But, among the world’s estimated 111 million migrant women (half the total), violence and abuse can occur at any time, starting from the very outset of the migration process.	但是，据估计，全世界有1.11亿女性移民（大约占总数的一半 ） ， 而在移民过程中，随时可能发生暴力和虐待，几乎从移民过程的一开始就是如此。
Throughout the migration cycle, women are more at risk from physical violence by fellow migrants, smugglers, and state officers, and can be forced to exchange sex for transportation, food, or accommodation.	在整个移民过程中，女性更容易受到来自同伴、走私贩和国家官员的人身伤害，并有可能被迫用性换取放行、食物和住宿。
Unsurprisingly, migrant women are often victims of human trafficking, finding themselves enslaved as laborers, prostitutes, or participants in organized begging operations.	毫不奇怪，女性移民往往是人口贩子的受害者，最后沦为奴役劳工、娼妓、或乞讨集团成员。
This is true regardless of why women migrate.	这就是事实，不管女性移民原因为何。
When women run for their lives because of natural or man-made disasters, gender-based violence is one of the great risks they face.	当女性因为自然或认为灾难而为生命而迁徙时，基于性别的暴力就成为她们所面临的的一个大威胁。
Displaced women, often destitute, are easy prey for criminals.	流离失所的女性往往身无分文，很容易成为犯罪对象。
This was one of my immediate concerns when Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines, and at my request a special program was instituted to alert and help women in peril.	当海燕台风袭击菲律宾时，我最担心的事情之一也在于此，在我的要求下成立了一个特别计划帮助受灾女性。
Even when women migrants find a job in a host country, it is rarely easy for them.	即使有女性移民在东道国找到了工作，也决不轻松。
They are predominantly employed in domestic work, care-giving, agriculture, and entertainment – all low-paid, largely unregulated sectors that are rarely covered by national labor laws.	她们大多从事家政、看护、农业和娱乐工作 — — 都是低薪工作，并且往往属于得不到国家劳动法覆盖的不受管制的部门。
They are often subject to punishingly long working hours, non-payment of wages, forced confinement, starvation, beating, sexual abuse, and threats and intimidation.	她们往往必须承受极长的工作时间、工资克扣、强制监禁、挨饿、挨打、被性虐待，还饱受威胁和恐吓。
Many women migrants are unskilled or undocumented domestic workers.	许多女性移民是无技能、无合同的家政工人。
This makes them more vulnerable to violence, because they typically depend on a single employer and in many countries face deportation if they attempt to change jobs.	这让她们更容易遭到暴力，因为她们往往得依靠单一雇主，并且在许多国家如果试图换工作就要面临遣返。
Moreover, social integration in a new country can be more difficult for women than for men.	此外，在新国家融入社会对于女性也比男性更难。
This is partly because women are often subject to harmful traditional practices, such as early and forced marriage, female genital mutilation, and so-called “honor” crimes, enforced by families who want to maintain a link with their country of origin.	这部分是因为女性通常需要被迫接受伤害性风俗，比如强制性童婚、割礼以及由试图坚守国家传统的家庭强制实施的所谓的“荣誉犯罪 ” 。
And it is especially difficult for women migrants to navigate between the tantalizing freedom of choice and expression in their host society and the traditional roles expected of them at home.	女性移民想要在东道国诱人的选择和言论自由和母国期待她们的传统角色之间游刃有余更是难上加难。
The rising number of migrant deaths – both women and men – at sea and in deserts is a wake-up call for the international community to act.	死于海中和沙漠中的移民数量 — — 不管是男性还是女性 — — 的上升是警世钟，国际社会应该行动起来。
IOM has called on all relevant actors – including countries of origin, transit countries, and destination countries – to address the plight of migrants attempting life-threatening journeys and find solutions.	IOM呼吁相关行动方 — — 包括来源国、中转国和目的国 — — 改变移民尝试有生命危险的旅程的现象并找出解决方案。
Protecting women migrants – often the most desperate of the desperate – should top their priorities.	保护女性移民 — — 她们通常是绝望者中的绝望者 — — 应该被列为重中之重。
In 2014, the international community will review the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, which expire next year, and decide on a post-2015 development agenda.	2014年，国际社会将评估明年到期的联合国千年发展目标并决定2015年后的发展日程。
IOM believes that migrants, and in particular women migrants, who in the past have been largely invisible in the language of development, must be a part of this.	IOM认为，移民，特别是女性移民，应该位列其中，她们过去的发展问题上往往受到忽视。
We must no longer ignore half the world’s migrants.	我们再也不能忽视世界移民人口中的这一半了。
Like all migrants, women on the move are entitled to personal security and basic dignity.	和所有移民一样，运动中的女性有权获得个人安全和基本尊严。
	
Will NATO’s Prodigal Son Return?	法国会重回北约怀抱吗？
PARIS -- Few state visits have lasting results.	巴黎—很少有国事访问能产生持久的成效。 而萨科齐对华盛顿刚刚进行的访问可能是个例外。
Nicolas Sarkozy’s just completed trip to Washington may be an exception, because the French President may be preparing to bring NATO a highly valued present for its 60th anniversary in the spring of 2009: France’s return to NATO’s integrated military structure, from which Charles de Gaulle withdrew in 1966.	因为这位法国总统可能正准备为北约在2009年春的60周年诞辰献上一份厚礼：法国将重返北约统一军事架构。 在1966年戴高乐执政时期法国退出了北约。
In retrospect, de Gaulle’s decision proved to be much more detrimental for France than for the Alliance.	回头看来，戴高乐的决定对法国造成的伤害比对北约造成的更大。
By withdrawing from NATO’s integrated military command, France excluded itself from political decision-making within the Alliance and thus became the equivalent of the “Harkis”– the local soldiers who served with the French army during the Algerian war: fine soldiers, but with virtually no reward for their service.	由于退出了北约的统一军事指挥体系，法国将自己排除在该联盟内部的政治决策之外，成为与“Harkis”军人类似的身份—这是些在阿尔及利亚战争中与法国军队并肩战斗的当地军人：勇猛的战士，但却几乎没有因为服役而获得任何犒赏。
How realistic is the possibility of scenario French return to NATO’s military fold?	法国重返北约军事体系的可能性究竟有多大？
Historically, aborted moves and faux pas abound on both sides in the French/NATO relationship, the latest being Jacques Chirac’s failed attempt to patch up France’s relations with NATO upon his arrival in power in 1995.	从法国—北约关系的历史上看，许多类似的举措要么不了了之、要么马失前蹄。 最近的一次失败是希拉克在1995年上台以后企图修补法国与北约关系的努力。
Success is not guaranteed this time, either, but the chances are much higher now, because France, the United States, and the world have changed.	虽然这次也不能保证成功，但机会却很大，因为法国、美国和世界都发生了变化。
For starters, the US now has a real friend and ally in the Élysée Palace.	首先，美国现在在爱丽舍宫有了一个真正的朋友。
To speak of Sarkozy as a substitute for Tony Blair in Europe would be premature – and unhelpful, given Blair’s inability to exert significant influence on US policy.	虽然鉴于布莱尔在对美国政策施加重大影响方面的无能，就说萨科齐会在欧洲取代他还言之过早—也于事无补。
But Sarkozy is both eager to transform France’s relations with the Alliance and has a strategy to do so.	但萨科齐不但有转变法国与北约关系的热情，还有相应的战略。
Moreover, the French army supports such a move, while only a small segment of the Foreign Ministry is opposed.	此外，法国军方也支持这一举动，只有外交部的一小部分人反对。
Sarkozy’s strategy is to link progress in building a common European defense and security structure with a redefinition of NATO.	萨科齐的战略是将建立欧洲共同安全与防务架构的进展与对北约的重新定义联系起来。
More Europe in security terms means more Alliance.	更安全的欧洲也意味着结盟程度更高的欧洲。
So, because Sarkozy wants to be seen as a convinced European, he must normalize France’s relations with a new Alliance based on two pillars – European and American.	所以，由于萨科齐希望被看作是一个满怀信心的欧洲人，他就必须使法国与新联盟的关系正常化。 新联盟的两大支柱是欧洲人与美国人。
Moreover, financial and human resources for military affairs are scarce and cannot be duplicated, while France and Britain want to restart the Saint-Malo process of bilateral defense efforts launched nearly ten years ago.	另外，尽管法国和英国想要重新启动近十年前开始实施的双边防务的Saint-Malo进程，但军事的财政和人力资源是稀缺并不可复制的。
As a result, for the sake of Europe, France must move closer to the Alliance.	所以，为了欧洲，法国必须与北约走得更近。
Sarkozy has also fully integrated into France’s approach to Europe a reckoning with the new balance of power within the European Union following the accession of Eastern European states.	萨科齐也完全融入了法国对欧洲的策略，在东欧诸国加入欧盟以后承认新的权力平衡。
Unlike Chirac, he understands that it is counterproductive and unrealistic to ask countries like Bulgaria or Romania to choose between their European or Atlantic loyalties.	与希拉克不同，他明白让保加利亚或罗马尼亚这样的国家在对欧盟或北约的忠诚之间做出抉择是不现实的，其后果会适得其反。
Here, again, strengthening Europe requires strengthening the Alliance.	这一点再次说明强化欧洲需要巩固北约。
Sarkozy’s approach may work, because America, too, has changed.	萨科齐的策略可能会行得通，因为美国也改变了。
In American eyes, the Kosovo war in 1999 demonstrated NATO’s glaring and myriad shortcomings, while the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, moved America still further away from the Alliance, particularly after President George W. Bush disparagingly rejected NATO’s offer of help.	在美国人的眼中，1999年的科索沃战争反映了北约的种种软肋，而2001年9月11日的恐怖袭击更使得美国与北约渐行渐远，特别是在布什总统轻蔑地拒绝了北约的援助之后。
Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld even tried to use divide-and-rule tactics by pitting “New” Europe against the “Old” Europe led by France and Germany, which opposed the Iraq war.	前防长拉姆斯菲尔德甚至试图采用“分而治之”的办法，在“新”欧洲和法、德领导的，反对伊拉克战争的“老”欧洲之间制造对抗。
Those divisions are now history, and American reservations about a European security pillar cannot trump America’s pressing needs for allied support.	这种分化现已成为历史，美国对欧洲安全支柱的迟疑远不如其对盟友支持的需求来得急迫。
Confronted with disaster in Iraq, the risk of Afghanistan following Iraq into chaos, and the escalating crisis with Iran, the US can no longer treat the NATO allies with disdain.	面对伊拉克的灾难，阿富汗步其后尘陷入混乱的风险和伊朗危机的升级，美国不能再轻视北约盟国了。
Although Europe remains militarily weak, America’s power is now in doubt.	虽然欧洲的军力依然虚弱，但美国的实力也令人怀疑。
If a European pillar within NATO is needed to strengthen the Alliance, why not accept it?	如果北约内部需要一个欧洲支柱来强化联盟，为什么不接受呢？
Beyond the changes in France and the US, the decisive factor behind the possible reinvention of NATO is the transformation of the international system itself.	在法国和美国的变化之外，重塑北约的可能性背后还有一个决定性因素，那就是国际体系本身的变化。
Aside from the explosive situation in the Middle East and the threat of Islamist terrorism, the West is now confronted with the rise of Asia, the return of a more assertive Russia, and new energy and environmental challenges.	除了中东一触即发的局势和伊斯兰恐怖主义的威胁，西方现在还面临着亚洲的崛起、一个更为自负的俄罗斯和新的能源及环境挑战。
Both France and America have a key role to play in addressing these issues effectively.	法国和美国在有效应对这些问题方面都要扮演关键性的角色。
Sarkozy’s trip to Washington, and his address to a receptive US Congress, was one more step toward ensuring that they do so together.	萨科齐的华盛顿之行和他受到美国国会欢迎的演讲是确保两国走向合作的第一步。
	
Bankers with Borders	有边界的银行家
LONDON – When Mark Carney replaces Mervyn King as Governor of the Bank of England in July 2013, the world will be deprived of King’s witty public utterances.	发自伦敦 — — 等到马克·卡尼（Mark Carney）在2013年7月接替默文·金（Mervyn King）成为英格兰银行行长之后，我们就再也听不到后者诙谐幽默的公开发言了。
My personal favorite came when, commenting on strong retail-sales figures during one Christmas period, he cast doubt on their significance for assessing the state of the economy.	我很喜欢他对圣诞期间零售业强劲数据的评论，这些数据对评估经济状况的重要性在他看来都值得怀疑。
“The true meaning of the story of Christmas” he solemnly intoned, “will not be revealed until Easter, or possibly much later.”	“圣诞节的真正意义 ， ” 他严肃地吟诵道 ， “ 要到复活节或更晚之后才能揭示 。 ”
A new career on the stage, or in the pulpit, surely beckons.	（一语双关，暗指耶稣显圣和经济真相的最终昭示都需要时间）可见一份在舞台或圣坛上的新事业会非常适合他。
King’s most quoted phrase is that “global banking institutions are global in life, but national in death.”	金被引用得最多的观点是“跨国银行机构因全球而生，却以国家而亡 。 ”
They trade globally, across porous borders, attaching little significance to the geographical location of capital and liquidity.	这些机构渗透各国边界进行全球交易，并不在乎资本和流动性的地理位置。
But, when the music stops, it is the home regulator, and the home central bank, that picks up the tab, even if the losses were incurred elsewhere.	可一旦环境恶化，即使这些损失产生于别处，却是其所在国监管机构和央行为之买单。
By the same token, a failing bank may leave behind a mess in third countries, which its home authorities may not clean up.	同样地，一个破产银行可能会在第三国留下一个烂摊子，但其所在国内当局可能并不会出面收拾残局。
Icelandic banks, for example, took deposits in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, and swept them back to Reykjavik, leaving the host countries out of pocket.	以冰岛各银行为例，它们把英国和荷兰的存款卷回雷克雅未克，却让两国去承担损失。
Likewise, the collapse of Lehman Brothers left European creditors more exposed than those in the US, whose funds had been wired home to New York on the Friday before the end.	同样，雷曼兄弟的倒闭将欧洲债权人置于比美国债权人更危险的境地，因为美国人的钱在一切结束前的那个星期五已经被汇回纽约了。
Regulators have been wrestling with this problem for years, without conspicuous success.	监管机构过去几年一直与这一问题搏斗，却未能取得明显成效。
In mid-December, the Bank of England (BoE) and the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) announced what seemed like a breakthrough, at least concerning the major banks headquartered in the US or the UK – that is, 12 of the 28 institutions regarded by the Financial Stability Board as globally systemic.	11月中旬，英格兰银行和美国联邦存款保险公司公布了一个似乎是突破的举措 — — 至少对总部设在美国和英国的大银行而言，也就是被金融稳定委员会视作28个全球系统性机构中的其中12个。
In their case, a resolution authority, in London or Washington, would take control of the parent company, remove senior management, and apportion losses to shareholders and unsecured creditors.	对它们来说，一个在华盛顿或伦敦的解决方案机构将会接管母公司，炒掉高级管理层，把损失摊派给股东和未受保护的债权人。
It sounded plausible.	这听起来似乎可行。
BoE officials declared firmly that they were prepared to trust their American counterparts, and would not step in to grab subsidiaries or assets based in the UK.	英国央行官员坚称他们已经做好准备相信美国同行，不会插手夺取位于英国的子公司或资产。
“This is a journey that involves trust,” said BoE Deputy Governor Paul Tucker.	英格兰银行副行长保罗·塔克（Paul Tucker）说 ： “ 这是一个包含着信任的过程 。 ”
But the Anglo-American love-in quickly soured when the FDIC chairman was asked to give the same assurances of confidence in the British authorities.	但是当美国联邦存款保险公司总裁被要求对英国当局作出同样的信心保证时，这场英美之恋立刻变了味。
According to the Financial Times, he “laughingly declined.”	根据《金融时报》的说法，他“笑着拒绝了 。 ”
Indeed, while the FDIC and the BoE were working on their plan, the US Federal Reserve was developing proposals that will expose overseas banks in the US to a far tighter set of controls, and closer supervision, than they have hitherto experienced.	事实上，当联���存款保险公司和英格兰银行研究其计划之时，美联储正在研究一种在美外资银行处于比当前更牢固掌控和严密监管之下的提案。
The Fed is seeking to oblige foreign banks to create a holding company to own their separately capitalized subsidiaries, effectively giving the Fed direct oversight of their business.	美联储正试图迫使外国银行建立一个控股公司，下属各单独资本化了的子公司，这能有效地让美联储直接监督他们的业务。
They will also be required to maintain stronger capital and liquidity positions in the US.	这些公司也将会被要求在美国保持更强大的资本和流动性头寸。
The justification offered for these new impositions is that overseas banks have moved beyond their traditional lending business to engage in substantial and often complex capital-market activities.	这些新规定产生的理由是外资银行已经越过了它们传统的贷款业务，参与到了实质性且通常比较复杂的资本市场活动之中。
“The crisis revealed the resulting risks to US financial stability,” said Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo.	“这场危机揭露了由此产生的美国金融稳定风险 ， ” 美联储理事丹尼尔·塔鲁洛（Daniel Tarullo）说到。
The UK’s Financial Services Authority has been invoking the same rationale for requiring foreign banks to establish local subsidiaries, rather than taking deposits or lending through a branch of the parent bank.	英国金融服务管理局已经使用相同的理由来要求外资银行建立当地子公司，而不是通过母公司下属的分公司来进行存款或贷款。
On the face of it, these moves appear to be well justified, given the mayhem created by poorly regulated banks in the major financial centers.	表面看来，考虑到监管不力的银行在全球各主要金融中心引起的混乱，这些举措似乎很合乎情理。
But we should be clear that these changes are not just tinkering at the edges.	但我们应该清楚这些变化并不是在边缘修修补补。
They amount to a reversal of decades of policy by American and British regulators.	它们相当于是美国和英国监管机构几十年政策的逆转。
Ernest Patrikis, a former Fed supervisor, points to the clear implication that in the US domestic banks will have a strong advantage over foreign banks.	美联储前主管欧内斯特·帕特里基斯（Ernest Patrikis）指出美国国内银行将会比外资银行拥有很强大的优势。
More dramatically, he asserts that “subsidiarization would be the end of international banking.”	更引人注目地是，他断言“子公司化将是国际银行业的归宿 。 ”
Larry Fink, the CEO of the multinational investment-management firm BlackRock, takes a similar view: “It really throws into question [the] whole globalization of these firms,” with “each country for [itself].”	跨国投资管理公司黑石集团的总裁拉里·芬克（Larry Fink）也持有类似的观点 ： “ 这些公司的整个全球化都遭到了质疑，每个国家都是为了自己的利益 ” 。
He adds: “I wouldn’t call it a trade war, but I would certainly call it a high level of protectionism.”	他补充到 ： “ 我不会把这称之为贸易战，但肯定会将其称之为高层次的保护主义 。 ”
One delicious irony in Europe is that Chinese banks are contesting the requirement to subsidiarize in London on precisely those grounds.	而在欧洲最有趣的讽刺就是中国各大银行恰恰是基于这些理由质疑在伦敦设立子公司的要求。
For now, high-octane worries about protectionism are probably overdone.	目前对保护主义政策的强烈担忧或许有些过虑了。
And it is difficult to deny that the Fed should take a close interest in the funding strategies of foreign banks operating in the US.	但也难以否认美联储应该更加关注在美外资银行的融资策略。
Another Fed governor, Jeremy Stein, has pointed out that foreign banks have dollar liabilities of roughly $8 trillion, much of it short-term wholesale funding.	另一位美联储理事 — — 杰里米·斯坦因（Jeremy Stein）曾指出外资银行有大约8万亿的美元债务，其中大部分是短期的大规模融资。
But there is a risk that these interventions are the thin end of a dangerous wedge.	但是存在着这样一个风险 — — 即这些干预是一个危险的端倪。
Forced subsidiarization causes capital and liquidity to be trapped in local legal entities, reducing the effectiveness with which that capital is used.	强制外资银行设立子公司会导致资本和流动性被困在当地的法律实体里，这降低了资本的有效性。
At a time when bank capital is scarce, that impediment carries significant economic costs.	在银行资本匮乏之时，这种阻碍就将承担着极大的经济成本。
Moreover, tools that may be used wisely and well by institutions with a global outlook, like the Fed and the Bank of England, could take on a different character in countries where a commitment to free and open markets cannot be taken for granted.	此外，能被具有全球视野的机构 — — 比如美联储和英格兰银行 — — 明智并合理使用的工具在某些国家里可能会呈现不同的特点，因为无法保证这些国家一定会致力于建立自由开放的市场。
So we must hope that the US and British authorities move carefully and do not use their new powers to freeze out foreign competition.	所以我们不得不希望美英当局小心行事且不要运用它们的新权力来排斥国外竞争。
“Be careful what you wish for” is wise advice in the regulatory world, as it is elsewhere.	“注意你自己的愿望”的忠告不仅适用于别处，对监管者来说也是如此。
	
Will Next Time Be Different?	下次会不一样吗？
CHICAGO – Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, in their excellent, eponymous book on debt crises, argue that the most dangerous words in any language are “This time is different.”	发自芝加哥 — — 卡门·莱因哈特与肯尼思·罗格夫这两位经济学家曾合著了一本关于债务危机的大作，书中认为最危险的说辞莫过于“这次跟以前不同了 。 ”
Perhaps the next most dangerous words are “Next time will be different.”	而或许危险程度排名第二的句子则是“下次肯定不会像以往那样 。 ”
These words are often uttered when politicians and central banks want to bail out some troubled segment of the economy.	每当那些政客和中央银行试图拯救某些陷入麻烦的经济部门时，类似的说辞就会从他们嘴里蹦出来。
“Yes,” one can almost hear them saying, “we understand that bailing out banks will subvert market discipline. But you cannot expect us to stand by and watch the system collapse, causing millions of innocent people to suffer.	人们几乎可以猜到讲话内容 ： “ 我们明白拯救银行会破坏市场纪律，但你也不能让我们眼睁睁看着整个系统崩溃，让数百万无辜民众受苦受难吧，事已至此，也只能硬着头皮去面对了。
We have to live with the hand we are dealt. But next time will be different.”	不过我保证下次肯定不会像以往那样的 。 ”
They then use every tool they have to prevent economic losses on their watch.	然后他们就用尽手中一切手段去制止自己当政期间的一切经济损失。
The government’s incentives are clear.	政府的动机其实相当明确。
The public rewards them for dealing with the problem at hand – whether building levees to protect houses built on a flood plain or rescuing banks that have dodgy securities on their balance sheets.	公众总会对他们应对当前问题的作为大加赞赏 — — 无论是兴建堤坝保护洪泛区民居还是拯救那些拥有有毒资产的银行。
Politicians and central bankers gain little by letting the greedy or careless face the full consequences of their actions, for many innocent people would suffer as well.	而倘若政客和中央银行官员们坐视那些始作俑者自食其果的话（这也会导致许多无辜民众受害 ） ， 他们自己却捞不到什么好处。
A sympathetic press would amplify their heart-rending stories of lost jobs and homes, making those counseling against intervention appear callous.	一个同情心泛滥的媒体将大肆渲染那些失业和无家可归者的辛酸故事，使得那些反对干涉的意见显得残忍且麻木不仁。
Democracies are necessarily soft-hearted, whereas markets and nature are not; government inevitably expands to fill the gap.	民主制度总是心太软，而市场和大自然则太过残酷；于是政府便无可避免地挺身而出，填补了双方之间的空白。
To the extent that the rough justice meted out by markets or nature teaches anyone to behave better, it has consequences far beyond the horizon of anyone in power today.	在某种程度上，正是市场和大自然那些粗暴而公正的惩罚教会了人们谨慎行事，同时这些惩罚也会带来超出当权者预料之外的成果。
When asked to choose between the risk of being known to posterity as the central banker who let the system collapse and the intangible future benefits of teaching risk takers a lesson, it does not take genius to predict the central banker’s decision.	但倘若要二者选其一：一是作为一个任由系统崩溃的中央银行官员遗臭万年，二是在给那些风险玩家一个教训之后收获不知何时降临的善果，估计很多中央银行家的答案都无法预测。
Democracy tends to institutionalize moral hazard in sectors that are economically or politically important, such as finance or real estate, allowing them to privatize gains and socialize losses.	民主制度倾向于用政策把那些在政治经济上具有重要意义的部门（比如金融或地产）所面临的道德风险包揽起来，让他们一面私有化其收益，另一面却将风险社会化。
Even though the authorities insist that the next time will be different, everyone knows that they will make the same decision when confronted with the same choice again.	即便当局坚称下不为例，所有人都知道他们下次肯定还会做出同样的决定。
So, knowing that next time will not be different, the authorities try their best to prevent a “next time.”	因此在明知下一次不会跟以往不同的情况下，政府会想尽办法避免“下一次 ” 。
But risk takers have every incentive to try their luck again, knowing that, at worst, they will be bailed out.	但那些金融冒险家们肯定有无数借口继续冒险，因为他们知道就算局面最终无法收拾，还是有人会出手拯救他们。
In this cat-and-mouse game, risk takers have the upper hand.	可见在这场猫鼠游戏中，冒险家们无疑占了上风。
For one thing, risk takers are typically small, cohesive interest groups that, once rescued, have a powerful incentive, as well as the resources, to buy the political influence needed to ensure a return to the status quo ante.	首先，这些冒险家属于一个极具凝聚力的小团体，一旦起死回生，他们就有极强的动机（以及资源）去换取所需的政治影响力，好让自己能回复到从前的状况。
If risk takers were allowed to face more serious losses, they would have fewer resources to fight political attempts to constrain their risky activities.	如果能让这些人面对更严重损失的话，他们就无法拥有那么多资源去抵抗那些限制其冒险行为的政治行动。
Moreover, the public does not have a long memory, a long time horizon, or an appetite for detail.	此外，公众往往是健忘，短视而且不关注细节的。
Even as the United States’ voluminous Dodd-Frank bill tried to ensure that bankers never subjected American taxpayers to undue risk again, public attention had moved on to the state of the real economy and unemployment.	当长篇大论的多德-法兰克法案还在试图确保银行家们不再把美国纳税人置于危险中时，公众的注意力早就转移到了实体经济和就业之上。
Why focus on financial regulation when the risks of an immediate collapse are small, and when the details are so tedious?	在公众眼中既然迅速崩溃的风险已经很小，法律规章的细节又是如此冗长乏味，又何必再着眼于金融管制呢？
As technical experts and lobbyists took over, and the public lost interest, Dodd-Frank became friendlier and friendlier to the banks.	于是技术官员和国会游说者占据了上风，公众又逐渐失去了兴趣，多德-法兰克法案最终也逐渐向银行利益倾斜。
So how can this one-way betting be stopped?	那么这种一面倒的情况何时才是尽头？
The scary answer may be that it does not end until governments run out of money (as in Ireland) or the public runs out of sympathy (as in Germany vis-à-vis the rest of Europe).	最令人心惊的答案莫过于直到政府都没钱了（爱尔兰那样）或者公众没有了同情心（正如德国人对欧洲其他地区的态度）的那一天。
To avoid that fate, governments should start by recognizing that the system is programmed to respond to deep distress, and that they can do nothing about it.	为了避免这一命运，各国政府应当逐步认识到整个系统早已有了应对深刻危机的一套方法，而且任何人力都无法改变。
But they must try to ensure that they do not destroy incentives by doing too much. And they must offset the distortions created by intervention in other ways.	但他们必须努力确保不会因为过度作为而损害了市场的内在动力，同时也必须补偿由其他干涉行为而导致的市场扭曲。
For example, the US Federal Reserve has essentially guaranteed the financial sector that if it gets into trouble, ultra-low interest rates will be maintained (at the expense of savers) until the sector recovers.	比如说，美国联邦储备委员会（简称美联储）就向金融部门保证，一旦后者陷入麻烦就将维持极低利率直到该部门复苏为止。
In the early to mid-1990’s, rates were kept low because of banks’ real-estate problems.	在1990年代中早期为了解决银行的地产问题而一直压低利率。
They were slashed again in 2001 and kept ultra-low after the dot-com bust.	随后2001年互联网泡沫爆破，于是利率又再次下滑并维持在极低水平。
And they have been ultra-low since 2008.	如今的低利率已经从2008年维持至今。
Senior Fed policymakers deny that their interest-rate policy bears any responsibility for risk taking, but there is much evidence to the contrary.	美联储高级政策制定者否认自身利率政策对冒险行为负有任何责任，但许多证据却告诉了我们一个相反的事实。
It would be difficult for the Fed to respond differently if the financial sector gets into trouble again.	倘若金融部门再度惹祸上身的话，估计美联储的做法还会是老一套。
But it does not have to maintain ultra-low interest rates after the crisis has passed, especially if those rates have little impact on generating sustainable economic activity.	但它没必要在危机过后继续维持极低利率，尤其是当这些利率对促进可持续经济活动的作用已经很小的时候。
Doing so merely rewards banks for their past excesses – and taxes savers.	这种做法���仅是便宜了那些曾经过度放肆的银行 — — 还有那些避税的富人。
More importantly, if the Fed wants to restore incentives for risk takers and savers, it should offset the effects of staying “low for long” in bad times by increasing interest rates more rapidly than is strictly necessary as the economy recovers.	更重要的是，如果美联储想要恢复冒险者以及储蓄者的动力，就必须停止那在危机时期维持“长期低利率”的做法，转而在复苏时更迅速地升高利率。
This will, of course, be politically difficult, because the public has been programmed to think that ultra-low rates are good, and higher rates bad, for growth, without any consideration for the long-term sustainability of growth.	这在政治上当然会相当艰难，因为公众早就有了思维定势，认为极低利率肯定好，高利率肯定不好，却根本没有考虑到长期增长的可持续性。
Finally, the pressure on governments to intervene would be lower if individuals had access to a minimum safety net.	最后，如果民众个人能加入基本的社会安全网络的话，那些要求政府干涉的压力也会得到缓解。
Official US policy is so activist in downturns (regardless of its effectiveness) partly because unemployment is so costly to workers – who have little savings, unemployment benefits that run out quickly, and health care that is often tied to a job.	美国官方政策之所以在经济不景时如此活跃，某种程度上就是因为劳动阶层对失业极为敏感 — — 他们没有储蓄，失业救济也很快花光，而医疗往往又和工作挂钩。
A stronger safety net for individuals might allow politicians to accept more corporate or financial-sector distress, and help bolster their claim that next time really will be different.	一个更强大的个人社会安全网将使得政治家能容许企业和金融部门承担更大的压力，并帮助他们实现“下回真的跟以往不一样”的诺言。
	
Will Olmert Survive?	奥尔默特能否涉险过关？
After Israel’s inability last summer to achieve a conclusive victory over Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, public pressure forced Prime Minister Ehud Olmert’s government to appoint a commission to examine the causes of this surprising failure.	以色列军队去年夏天未能在南黎巴嫩对真主党取得决定性胜利之后，公众压力迫使总理奥尔默特政府任命一个委员会调查这一出人意料的失败的原因。
How could a small militia, numbering less than a few thousand combatants, survive the onslaught of the Middle East’s most formidable military machine?	一个人数不过几千人的小小民兵武装何以能够在中东地区最为强悍的军事机器的扫荡中存活下来？
The commission, headed by retired Supreme Court judge Eliyahu Winograd, has just published its interim report.	由退休的最高法院法官维诺格拉特领导的这一委员会刚刚发表了其临时报告。
Its criticism of Olmert, Defense Minister Amir Peretz, and Chief-of-Staff Dan Halutz – set forth in a detailed and meticulous 117-page assessment – is harsh, but not surprising.	这一报告严厉批评奥尔默特、国防部长佩雷茨以及总参谋长哈卢茨，并不出人所料，同时还提出了具体而又精确的长达117页的评估。
The Winograd Commission articulated what most Israelis already think: Olmert and Peretz lacked the military, security, and policy experience to confront a terrorist organization that raided Israeli territory, killed a number of soldiers and kidnapped two, and then launched thousands of rockets on civilian targets for over a month.	维诺格拉特委员会表达了大多数以色列人已经存在的看法，那就是奥尔默特和佩雷茨缺乏军事、安全以及政策经验来面对真主党恐怖组织。 这一恐怖组织袭击以色列领土，杀害数名以色列士兵并且绑架两名士兵，然后又在一个多月的时间里向平民目标发射数以千计的火箭。
Indeed, the inexperience of the prime minister and the defense minister are unprecedented in Israel’s history.	确实，总理和国防部长经验不足在以色列历史上是前所未有的。
Olmert, who stepped into Ariel Sharon’s shoes as leader of the new Kadima Party, was considered a competent but lackluster parliamentarian – and later mayor of Jerusalem – who was known more for his polemical style than for his political stature or gravitas.	奥尔默特顶替沙龙成为新组建的前进党领导人，他被认为是一个称职而又没有魅力的议会议员。 他后还作过耶路撒冷市长，其好辩的风格为人所知，要超过其政治地位或实力。
For most Israelis, even those who voted for him as the bearer of Sharon’s legacy after the Gaza disengagement, Olmert thus remained the accidental prime minister.	对于大多数以色列人而言，即使他们在加沙地带撤军后投票选举奥尔默特作为沙龙的遗产的继承人，他也只还是一个意外的总理。
Likewise, Peretz, a rabble-rousing but effective trade unionist, surprised all when he won the Labor Party’s leadership primary and then chose the defense portfolio over the treasury.	同样，佩雷茨是一个有效的工会人士，颇能煽动人心。 当他赢得工党领导人初选后没有选择成为财政部长而选择国防部长的时候，大家都感到惊讶。
To many, the duo of Olmert and Peretz seemed to invite trouble.	对于很多人而言，奥尔默特和佩雷茨这一对组合看起来就会引来麻烦。
Precisely because Israelis are aware of the constant security threat facing their country, they have always believed that their leaders should be able to lead Israel in war – but also to ask the military tough questions when diplomacy may fail.	正是由于以色列人清楚他们的国家时刻面临安全威胁，他们总是相信，他们的领导人能够在战争中带领以色列，同时，在外交努力失败的时候，他们也能够提出严厉的军事问题。
When such a moment arrived, totally out of the blue (or so it seemed) with Hezbollah’s raid on July 12, 2006, Israel’s two top politicians were completely out of their depth, stumbling into a war for which neither they nor the Israeli Army were prepared.	当这一时刻来临之际，也就是2006年7月12日真主党完全出乎意料地（或者看起来如此）发动袭击的时候，以色列两位最高的政治人物完全不知所措，匆忙之中应战，他们本人以及以色列陆军都没有做好准备。 在历史上第一次，以色列军队由一名空军将军哈卢茨领导。
The military was led – for the first time in its history – by an Air Force general, Dan Halutz, who believed that everything could be solved by air power, creating a combustible combination of civilian ignorance and military arrogance.	他相信空中力量可以解决一切问题，从而造成文职领导人的无知以及军队的傲慢。 二者结合就导致局势极度危机。
In measured but devastating prose, the Winograd Commission gives failing marks to all three leaders.	维诺格拉特报告以克制而又严厉的笔调对所有三位领导人都评定为不及格。
Olmert decided to go into battle recklessly and unaware of the consequences.	奥尔默特决定仓促作战，不知后果。
Peretz was unable to gauge the strategic implications of his decisions.	佩雷茨无法预测其决定的政治后果。
And Halutz failed to present the civilian leadership with the full panoply of military options at the army’s disposal.	而哈卢茨则没有向文职领导人提出军队所有的所有军事选择。
Halutz already resigned a few months ago.	哈卢茨已经在几个月前辞职。
But both Olmert and Peretz have declared that, despite the Commission’s conclusions, they would not quit: instead, they have vowed to implement the report’s many far-reaching substantive recommendations about policy, strategy, and decision-making processes.	但是奥尔默特和佩雷茨二人都宣称，尽管委员会作出了这些结论，他们都不会辞职。 相反，他们发誓要落实该报告提出的许多有关政策、战略以及决策过程的范围广泛的实质性建议。
Will Olmert and Peretz be able to stay on?	奥尔默特和佩雷茨能否留任？
Their coalition government enjoys a comfortable parliamentary majority; nor does the political arithmetic imply a viable parliamentary alternative.	他们的联合政府在议会中占据较大的多数席位。 政治算术也并不表明可以有能够存活下来的其他的议会组成选择。
But public opinion – volatile and angry – calls for both to resign: a public-opinion poll conducted after the Commission published its report indicated that only 14% of Israelis believe that Olmert should keep his job, while less than 11% support Peretz.	但是舆论是不定的而又愤怒，要求二人都辞职。 委员会发表其报告后所作的民意调查表明，14％的以色列人相信奥尔默特应当留任，而支持佩雷茨的人不到11 ％ 。
Later this week, demonstrations calling for the government's resignation are planned, and it will become obviously more difficult for the government to continue to function.	现在已经有人计划在本周晚些时候举行要求政府辞职的游行示威，而这将明显地让政府更加难以继续运作。
There are already rumors about a palace coup within Kadima, aimed at replacing Olmert with either the deputy prime minister, the veteran Shimon Peres, or the popular foreign minister, Tzipi Livni.	现在已经有传言说前进党内部要有宫廷政变，目的在于用副总理、元老佩雷斯或者广受欢迎的外长利夫尼取代奥尔默特。
But it does not appear that Olmert will allow himself to be pushed out.	但是看起来奥尔默特是不会允许然自己被赶走的。
In fact, Olmert’s weak and discredited government may yet survive.	实际上，奥尔默特软弱而又饱受垢病的政府可能还是可以存活下来。
If the government were to fall and new elections held, there are strong indications that the winner might be Binyamin Netanyahu, of the right-wing Likud, which was decimated in the 2006 elections, but is now patiently waiting in the wings.	如果政府倒台，举行新的选举，获胜者很有可能是右翼利库德集团的内塔尼亚胡。 该党在2006年的选举中一败涂地，但是现在却耐心等待时机。
Many who want Olmert to go would still not welcome a Netanyahu comeback, which may also explain what appears to be an indirect endorsement of Olmert by the United States.	许多想要奥尔默特下台的人还是不会欢迎内塔尼亚胡卷土重来，这也就是为何美国间接地支持奥尔默特的原因了。
Only a strong Israeli government can make the painful decisions necessary for negotiations with the Palestinians to succeed.	只有一个强大的以色列政府才能够作出并实施与巴勒斯坦谈判所必要的痛苦决定。
As a result, the prospects for meaningful continuation of Israeli-Palestinian talks look even dimmer than they did before.	结果，���以会谈有意义地进行下去的前景要比过去看起来还要暗淡。
Indeed, the real loser of the 2006 Lebanon war was neither Israel nor Hezbollah, but, at least for the time being, the peace process.	确实，2006年黎巴嫩战争中真正的失败者既不是以色列也不是真主党，而是中东和平进程，至少目前如此。
	
Will Rising Interest Rates Torpedo Stock and House Prices?	利率上升会危及股价和房价吗？
Interest rates around the world are poised to rise.	世界范围内的银行利率都呈上升之势。
Short-term rates have gone so low since the worldwide recession of 2001 - 1% and 2%, respectively, in the United States and the Eurozone, and practically zero in Japan - that a strengthening world economy will force central banks to tighten the monetary reins.	短期利率自2001年世界经济不景气以来已降到如此之低-美国和欧元区的利率分别为1%和2 % ， 日本的利率几乎为零-以至于正在走强的世界经济会迫使各国央行收紧货币政策。
Australia's central bank has already been raising rates since May 2002, and Great Britain's since November 2003.	澳大利亚中央银行自2002年5月以来就一直在调高利率，英国自2003年11月以来也一直在这么做。
In the US, the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting on June 29-30 is likely to mark a major turning point, reversing the steady decline of the benchmark federal funds rate since Alan Greenspan began loosening monetary policy in 2001.	在美国，即将于6月29-30日召开的联邦开放市场委员会会议可能会标志一个重要的转折点。 它会扭转自格林斯潘2001年放松货币政策以来基准联邦基金利率持续降低的趋势。
This is likely to be followed by rate increases in China, the Eurozone, and elsewhere.	这有可能进一步带动中国、欧元区和其它地区调高利率。
Given the tendency of central banks to change interest rates gradually, any change of direction likely means more changes in the same direction later.	由于各国央行通常会逐渐调整利率，所以某一大方向上的调整往往意味着一种持续而来的趋势。
What will this landmark change mean for prices of such assets as stocks and homes?	这一重大调整对诸如股票和住房一类的资产又意味着什么呢？
In theory, when interest rates go up, there is reason to believe that asset prices will go down.	从理论上讲，当利率提高时，人们就有理由相信资产价格会走低。
The higher interest rates go, the better are investments in bonds, which compete with investments in other assets such as stocks or homes.	利率越高，债券的投资行情就越被看好。 投资债券与投资股票和房产是一种竞争的关系。
Higher interest rates also raise the cost of borrowing to buy these assets, which may diminish demand for them, exerting downward pressure on their prices.	更高的利率还会使用于购买这些资产的贷款成本增加。 增加的贷款成本可能会减少人们对这些资产的需求，并给这些资产施加降价的压力。
When interest rates fall, the opposite effect on asset prices may be predicted.	而当利率调低时，人们就能预测其会对资产价格产生相反的作用。
In fact, the history of the stock market's reactions to changing interest rates is mixed.	从实际上看，股票市场对利率变化的反应是混合的。
Sometimes interest rate changes have the predicted effect, sometimes they don't.	有时利率变化会带来人们意料之中的影响，而有时却不尽然。
For example, the NASDAQ stock price index made a spectacular 14% jump upwards on the day (January 3, 2001) when America's Fed began its latest series of interest rate cuts.	例如，在美联储开始其最近的一系列降息的那一天（2001年1月3日）纳斯达克股价指数暴涨14 % 。
A jump in the market is what one might have expected.	股价急升也许是人们意料之中的。
But then the NASDAQ index fell 22% over the following year, although the Fed continued to cut interest rates aggressively.	可虽然美联储继续大幅调低利率，纳斯达克指数在次年却下滑了22 % 。
Does that experience suggest that the NASDAQ index will drop sharply if the Fed raises interest rates on June 30?	根据以往的经验，纳斯达克指数会在美联储6月30日调高利率之后急剧下滑吗？
No.	答案是否定的。
The timing of the 2001 rate decrease stunned the market.	2001年的降息让市场措手不及。
By contrast, the Fed is widely expected to raise rates at the end this month, so there will be no surprise element.	相比之下，美联储在这个月底调高利率已在人们的意料之中，所以其中不存在突然性的元素。
The market may know, not just from the experience of 2001-2, that interest rate movements do not have predictable effects on stock prices.	市场可能会明白（不光从2001-2的经验当中）利率的波动对股价的影响是不可预测的。
But, there are reasons to believe that higher interest rates, even though expected, can have a negative impact on home prices.	但人们却有理由相信较高的利率，即便在人们的预料之中，也能对房价产生负面影响。
That is because home buyers are mostly ordinary people with little financial sophistication, unlike the professionals who trade in stocks.	这是因为与从事股票交易的专业人士不同，购房者大都是不谙金融之道的普通人。
Untrained people with other things on their minds can make serious economic errors.	怀有其它顾虑的非专业人士可能会犯严重的经济错误。
Home values have soared to high levels in many countries as irrational exuberance grips the markets.	由于市场被非理性的繁荣所控制，���多国家的房地产都已大幅增值。
High home prices are already putting great stress on many families, which are struggling to make their mortgage payments.	高昂的房价已经给很多正艰难地偿还按揭贷款的家庭增加了巨大的压力。
When interest rates go up, these payments will (when the rate is variable) also go up, possibly becoming unsustainable.	当利率增加时，还款额也会增加（在可变利率的情况下 ） ， 并可能变得难以负担。
If one borrows the equivalent of three years' income to buy a house, a mortgage rate of 6% means that 18% of one's income goes to interest payments, which may be tolerable.	如果某人以6%的按揭利率贷了相当于其三年总收入的购房款，这就意味着其收入的18%将会用于偿还利息，这样的负担也许还能承受。
But if the rate rises to 8%, mortgage interest payments rise to 24%, which, together with amortization, taxes, other debts, and necessary expenditures, may claim too much of the family budget.	但如果利率上升至8 % ， 按揭还款利息的比例就会上升到24 % ， 再加上分期付款、杂税、其它债务和必要支出，这样的负担可能就会超出一个家庭的还款能力。
Some will then try to sell their overpriced homes, and the resulting market imbalance will cause prices to fall.	在此情况下，有些人可能就会出售其标价过高的住房，由此带来的市场不平衡就会导致房价下跌。
People with fixed-rate mortgages are also vulnerable to rate increases, though less directly.	办理了固定利率按揭贷款的人同样容易受利率上升的影响，只不过这种影响不那么直接罢了。
This is because if they have to move and sell their house, there may be no buyers who can afford higher interest payments, unless the home's price also falls.	这是因为如果他们不得不搬迁并出售住房，却可能没有买家能够负担得起更高的利息，除非房价也下跌。
By contrast, sophisticated investors, such as big stock market players, are unlikely to fall prey to this trap.	相比之下，如股市大户一类的久经世故的投资者就不大容易跌入这样的陷阱。
But homebuyers are not as savvy, so they may not see the change coming or they may fail to plan for it.	但购房者却没有那么精明，所以他们要么可能会发现不了即将到来的市场变化，要么可能会没有做好应对措施。
As psychologists have shown, people are susceptible to "wishful thinking bias," wishing away possible future problems that they would rather not think about.	心理学家们指出许多人都容易罹患"妄想偏见 " ， 不愿设想自己所不愿考虑但却极可能发生的事。
They may overemphasize the likelihood of economic success ("I will be making a lot more money in a few years") and underemphasize the commonplace problems that regularly challenge family budgets ("I will be losing my job or getting a divorce").	他们可能会过度强调经济成功的可能性 （ " 我会在未来几年赚很多钱 " ） 但却对时时威胁家庭预算的问题考虑不足 （ " 我会失业或离婚 " ） 。
This blithe attitude is ultimately behind real estate bubbles where they are occurring.	正是这种盲目乐观的态度造成了房地产泡沫的出现。
Low interest rates did not cause the bubbles.	低银行利率并没有造成泡沫。
They only made it easier for people, in those areas of the world where there is a half-believable story about a fabulous future economy, to indulge their fantasies.	低利率只是让那些生活在经济前景仿佛一片光明的地区的人们更容易沉浸在他们的幻想之中。
Interest rate increases will deliver a fresh dose of reality: the interest expense of owning a home is going to claim a larger share of family budgets, a hard fact that will eventually sink into our thinking.	利率的上升会让他们面对现实：购房的贷款利息将会占家庭预算的更大一部分，这是我们最终必须面对的严峻现实。
But declines in home prices will not occur quickly when central banks begin to raise interest rates.	但房价下跌不会在各国央行开始调高利率之后很快出现。
After two years of rate increases, Australia's home price boom only recently shows signs of abating.	在利率上升的两年之后，澳大利亚住房价格上涨的趋势才出现缓和迹象。
Dominated by amateur investors, home markets do not turn on a dime.	在业余投资者的主导下，房屋市场对利率变化并不敏感。
In places where home prices have been rising rapidly, the upward trend may continue or level off for a while.	在房价上涨过快的地方，这种上升趋势会在一段时间内保持或趋缓。
In most high-priced places, a real decline may not come for some time.	在大多数高房价地区，真正的房价下跌可能要在相当一段时间之后才会出现。
	
Will Russia Save the West?	俄国将会拯救西方？
MOSCOW – Rapid changes in the global economy and international politics are raising, once more, an eternal issue in Russia: the country’s relations with Europe, and with the Euro-Atlantic region as a whole.	莫斯科 — — 全球经济与国际政治的快速变革，使得一个永恒的话题又一次在俄罗斯被人提起，这便是俄国与欧洲以及整个“欧洲-大西洋地区”之间的关系问题。
Of course, Russia partly belongs to this region. Yet it cannot and does not want to join the West wholeheartedly – at least not yet.	当然，俄国也部分属于这一地区；但至少迄今为止，该国既无法、也不愿全心全意地加入西方。
Meanwhile, this choice looks very different now compared to just a few years ago.	同时，与短短几年前相比，这一选择如今看上去已经发生了很大的改变。
It is becoming obvious that the Euro-Atlantic world, whose economic and political model seemed so triumphant 20 years ago, is now lagging somewhat behind China and other Asian countries.	欧洲-大西洋世界的经济与政治模式在二十年前看上去大获成功，但它如今已稍稍落后于中国以及其他亚洲国家，这种颓势正变得日益明显。
So is Russia, where, despite encouraging talk about innovation-based development, the economy continues to de-modernize as corruption has been allowed to metastasize, and as the country relies increasingly on its natural-resource wealth.	俄罗斯同样如此，尽管不乏鼓舞人心的言论（如建立在创新基础上的发展 ） ， 但随着贪腐弊病被允许向着各处蔓延、加上该国愈加依赖于自然资源这一财富，如今的俄罗斯经济之现代化程度正在继续下降。
Indeed, it is Asia that has turned out to be the true winner of the Cold War.	的确，亚洲已证明自己才是冷战的真正胜利者。
These rising powers raise problems regarding Russia’s geo-strategic choices.	这些崛起中的大国，为俄罗斯的地缘战略抉择带来了问题。
For the first time in decades, the values gap between Russia and the EU appears to be increasing.	数十年来头一回，俄国与欧盟之间的价值隔阂看起来正在加大。
Europe is overcoming state nationalism, while Russia is building a nation state.	欧洲正在克服国家民族主义，而俄罗斯却在构建一个民族国家。
Broken by history and not wishing to be ravaged by war again, Europeans have embraced compromise and renounced the direct use of force in international relations.	为历史恩怨搅得身心俱疲、且不愿再受战争之苦的欧洲人，已经接受了妥协这种方式，并放弃了在国际关系中对武力的直接使用。
Russians, on the other hand, emphasize their “hard power,” including military force, because they know that they live in a dangerous world and have no one to hide behind.	而俄国人正好相反，他们继续强调包括军事力量在内的“硬实力 ” ， 因为他们明白：自己身处一个危机四伏的世界之中，且没有靠山可供求助。
And, because of the country’s comparative lack of “soft power” – social, cultural, and economic attractiveness – it stands ready to use the competitive advantages (i.e., its resource wealth) available to it.	而且，由于该国社会、文化以及经济方面的吸引力等“软实力”相对缺乏，它只得做好准备，将其竞争力高的现有优势（比如其资源领域的财富）加以应用。
Internal political developments in Russia are also pushing the country in a different direction from the West.	俄国国内政治的发展也使该国与西方渐行渐远。
Quite simply, Russia is moving away from democracy.	道理很简单，俄罗斯正在远离民主制度。
This emerging values gap is not an insurmountable obstacle to geostrategic rapprochement.	对于地缘战略层面的和解而言，这一逐步浮现的价值隔阂并非一道不可逾越的鸿沟。
But, coupled with mutual irritation, which is particularly strong in Russia, closing the gap is becoming much harder.	但与之相伴的还有俄国与西方的相互刺激（这一点在俄国尤为强烈 ） ， 这使得消除隔阂的难度增大了许多。
For, while Russia’s elite never considered itself defeated in the Cold War, the West essentially treated Russia as a defeated country – an attitude symbolized by NATO’s eastward expansion, which laid a deep foundation for ongoing tension.	因为尽管俄国精英从未认为自己在冷战中落败，但西方的做法从本质上说，就是在以对待战败国的方式对待俄罗斯；而北约东扩便是这种态度的典型表现，这一做法为目前的紧张状态埋下了很深的伏笔。
It was only after the West encountered an armed rebuff in South Ossetia that NATO expansion was stopped in its tracks.	直到西方在南奥赛梯地区遭遇到武力抵制之后，北约东扩的脚步方才停下。
Yet NATO has not given up on further enlargement.	然而，北约仍未放弃进一步的扩张。
NATO expansion is nothing more than the extension of its zone of influence – and in the most sensitive, military-political sphere.	北约东扩其实就是自身势力范围的扩张（这还是在最为敏感的军事与政治领域 ） 。
And yet the West’s unwillingness to abandon that effort is coupled with a repeated refusal to recognize Russia’s right to have its own zone of interest.	而且西方在不愿放弃扩张努力的同时，还三番五次地拒绝承认俄罗斯也有获得其自身利益范围的权利。
So NATO expansion has left the Cold War unfinished. The ideological and military confrontation that underlay it is gone, but the geopolitical rivalry that it entailed has returned to the fore.	因此，北约东扩使得冷战仍未结束；作为冷战基础的意识形态与军事对抗已然不见踪影，但随之而来的地缘政治竞争却重返舞台中央。
Thus, the old mentality survived on both sides.	这样，传统思维在俄国与西方都重现生机。
Energy debates are another example of this.	能源争论则是另一个例证。
Non-Russian Europe should thank the Almighty for the presence of energy-rich Russia at its borders, while Russia should be thankful for having such wealthy customers.	俄国以外的欧洲应该感谢上帝，因为后者安排能源丰富的俄罗斯与它为邻；而俄国也应为拥有这样一批富有的主顾而心存感激。
But the natural differences in the interests of energy consumers and producers have been given a political/security twist – witness the discussions about an “Energy NATO.”	但能源消费者与生产者之间利益的天然分歧，又被打上了政治与安全方面的色彩，于是便出现了关于“能源北约”的讨论。
Faced with the impossibility of advantageous accession to Euro-Atlantic institutions, Russia is drifting fast towards alignment with China – a “younger brother,” though a respected one.	俄国在眼见无望以有利条件加入欧洲-大西洋机制后，便向着与中国这个“小兄弟 ” （ 不过却是一个令人敬重的后辈）结盟的方向快速转变。
Russia’s “Asian choice” of today is not the same as the Slavophile/Eurasian choice of the past.	如今，俄国的“亚洲选择”已不同于往日那种斯拉夫主义/欧亚主义之选择。
On the surface, it looks like a choice in favor of a rapidly rising civilization. But the current estrangement from Europe – the cradle of Russian civilization and modernization – threatens Russia’s identity and will increase its geostrategic risks in the future.	从表面上看，这似乎是一个有利于快速崛起之文明的选择，但当前俄国与欧洲（这是俄国文明与现代化的摇篮）的疏离，却对前者的身份产生了威胁，并会增加其未来的地缘战略风险。
Europe does not benefit from this estrangement either.	
It will continue to move towards beautiful decay – Venice writ large.	
The United States also loses. Without Russia, which will remain the world’s third strongest power for the foreseeable future, it is impossible to solve the key problems of international security.	欧洲也不会从这一疏离中获益，它将继续其优雅的衰败过程 — — 威尼斯便是很好的例子；美国同样未能幸免，它若失去了在可预见的未来中、继续身为全球第三强国的俄罗斯之协助，也将无法解决国际安全领域的关键问题。
The current Euro-Atlantic security architecture seems to suit the majority of Americans and Europeans, though it is becoming increasingly fragile and counterproductive.So Russia will struggle to create a new architecture largely on its own – whether through a new treaty on collective European security, or even through its accession to NATO.	当前的欧洲-大西洋安全体系，尽管正变得日渐脆弱，其效果也愈加事与愿违，但看起来它却仍令大部分美欧人士中意。 因此，俄罗斯将主要依靠自己的力量，努力创建出一个新的体系 — — 无论是通过欧洲集体安全方面的新条约，还是甚至通过加入北约。
This is not only in Russian political and civilizational interest, but it also reflects our duty to the entire community of Euro-Atlantic nations, which is being weakened by the “unfinished Cold War.”	这不单符合俄国的政治与文明利益，也反映出我们对于整个欧洲-大西洋诸国共同体的义务，后者正被“尚未完结的冷战”所削弱。
The idea of a “Union of Europe” between Russia and the EU should be put on the long-term agenda.	而在俄国与欧盟之间建立一个“欧洲联合体”的设想，也应被列入长期日程安排之中。
That Union should be based on a common human, economic, and energy space.	这一联合体应当建立在共同的人员、经济与能源范围基础之上。
The combination of a new security arrangement for the Euro-Atlantic community and the establishment of the Union of Europe could arrest the decline in the international weight of the West.	在欧洲-大西洋共同体的新型安全制度、以及欧洲联合体的建立这两大因素的共同作用之下，西方国际影响力的下滑趋势将得以终止。
	
Will Success Spoil Brazil?	成功会不会让巴西骄纵？
RIO DE JANEIRO – Brazil has been making international headlines of late, but not for traditional stories about urban violence, natural catastrophes, political corruption, or deforestation in the Amazon.	巴西最近登上了国际新闻的头版头条，但却不是因为城市暴力、自然灾害、政治腐败或亚马逊地区森林砍伐等传统的报导。
At the G-20 Summit in London last April, for example, US President Barack Obama called for the world to pay heed to Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the “most popular politician on earth,” and shook hands with him, saying: “My man right here.	去年4月召开的伦敦二十国峰会上，美国总统巴拉克·奥巴马呼吁世界关注巴西总统路易斯·伊纳西奥·卢拉·达席尔瓦，称他为“地球上最受欢迎的政治家 ” ， 奥巴马同达席尔瓦握手，说 ： “ 这是我的偶像。
I love this guy.”	我爱他 。 ”
In September, the ousted president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, reappeared in the country inside the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa after three months of exile.	9月，遭到驱逐的洪都拉斯总统曼努埃尔·塞拉亚在经历了三个月的流亡生活后在巴西驻特古西加尔巴大使馆再度露面。
Although his presence dramatically fuelled the situation for a time, Brazilian diplomats, working with the US, were able to reach agreement with Honduran authorities to allow Manuel Zelaya to return to office.	虽然他的现身一度给本已混乱的局势火上浇油，但巴西外交人员与美国合作，成功地与洪都拉斯当局达成协议，允许曼努埃尔·塞拉亚重新执政。
Then came the news that Brazil will host the 2016 Summer Olympic Games – this coming on top of hosting the 2014 World Cup.	随后传来消息说2016年夏季奥运会将在巴西举办 — — 巴西也同样是2014年世界杯的主办国。
As for the global – and fortunately now abating – economic crisis, Brazil has shined throughout, recording a fast and strong recovery.	在正在趋于缓和的全球经济危机中，巴西自始至终一直表现出色，出现了快速强劲的经济复苏。
And, as if this good news were not enough, Brazil’s giant state oil company, Petrobrás, is already at work developing two huge deep-water oil fields discovered in the sea off the coast of Rio de Janeiro.	这还不算，巴西的巨型国家石油企业巴西石油公司（Petrobrás）已经着手实施沿里约热内卢海岸线发现的两块巨型深水油田的开发工作。
For these and other reasons, Brazil is gaining the world’s attention.	上述以及其它原因让巴西受到世界的瞩目。
Brazilian democracy, at long last, is working well, following many years of military government, and its economy seems more robust than ever.	巴西的民主制度在历经多年的军政府统治后，终于得以修成正果，巴西经济也比以往任何时刻更加繁荣。
As a result, many people are enthusiastically pointing to an increased international role for Brazil in the future.	因此，许多人热情地指出巴西将在未来发挥更大的国际作用。
But two connected and major challenges lie ahead for Brazil and its government: the need to build a far more equal society and to resist the temptation to use nationalism to mask whatever domestic failures may manifest themselves.	但巴西及其政府面临着两项相互关联的重大挑战：建设更为平等的社会，以及经受住利用民族主义掩盖任何国内失败的诱惑。
Brazil’s current success is rooted not only in Lula’s two terms, which must end in 2010.	不仅是必须在2010年结束两届任期的卢拉造就了巴西目前的成功。
The economic stabilization program enacted by Fernando Henrique Cardoso since 1994 (the Real Plan), first as finance minister and then as president for two terms, solidified a structure that made it possible for Lula’s tenure to be so prosperous.	1994年来先任财政部长再任两届总统的费尔南多·恩里克·卡多佐推行的经济稳定计划（即雷亚尔计划）奠定了坚实的结构性基础，使得卢拉在其任期内有可能实现经济繁荣。
This is not meant to take anything away from Lula.	但这丝毫也不能抹杀卢拉的贡献。
His presidency has guaranteed political stability and strengthened social cohesion.	他在总统任期内保障了政治稳定，加强了社会凝聚力。
Indeed, by managing the political process to make the government work for Brazil’s people, Lula’s administration has made Brazil a truly stable and consensual democracy.	事实上，卢拉内阁通过管理政治程序实现了政府为巴西人民服务，并使巴西成为真正稳定团结的民主国家。
There is nothing modest about that achievement, given Brazil’s traditional institutional instability and the series of major corruption scandals that engulfed Lula’s government in 2005 and 2006.	考虑到一直困扰着巴西的制度动荡和2005、2006年几乎吞噬卢拉政府的系列重大腐败丑闻，这一成绩的取得绝非易事。
Lula survived those scandals and did not move to amend the constitution in order to seek a third term, though some in Brazil pressed him to do so.	卢拉在那场丑闻中幸免于难，而且也顶住了来自巴西某些势力的压力，并未修改宪法谋求第三次连任。
Lula also enacted critically important social policies.	卢拉还推行了至关重要的社会政策。
Under his government, two million homes received electric power for the first time, 11 million very poor families gained the support of a minimum income (the Bolsa Família), the minimum salary grew 45% in real terms, thus benefiting 42 million people.	在以他为首的政府领导下，有两百万家庭首次用上了电，一千一百万极端贫困家庭获得了最低工资补助（家庭补助金计划 ） ， 最低薪酬按实值计算增长了45 % ， 并因此惠及了四千二百万民众。
Moreover, eight million jobs were created, 17 million people escaped poverty, and the income of the poorest 50% grew 32% – twice as fast as the income of the richest 10% in the same period.	此外，政府还创造了八百万个就业岗位，帮助一千七百万人实现脱贫，最贫困的半数人口收入增长了32 % — —这一比率相当于同时期10%最富裕人口收入增长速度的两倍。
And Lula achieved all this without triggering inflation, which he knows – perhaps a result of his own impoverished childhood – wreaks havoc on the poor most of all.	卢拉在不引发通胀的前提下实现了上述所有目标，因为他知道 — — 这或许来自于他本人贫困的童年经历 — — 通胀带给穷人的灾难最为深重。
This vast transformation has not only generated a virtuous circle that strengthened institutional stability and social capital. It has also differentiated Brazil from other countries in Latin America, putting the country in the forefront in the region in terms of dealing with traditional social and economic injustices in a democratic way.	如此巨大的转变不仅创造了强化制度稳定和社会资本的良性循环，同时也让巴西从诸多南美国家之中脱颖而出，使其站在了拉美地区以民主方式应对传统社会和经济不平等现象的最前沿领域。
Yet the remaining challenges are huge, for Brazil remains the seventh most unequal society in the world – and severe violence persists.	但余下的挑战也非常巨大，因为巴西仍然是世界第七大最不平等社会 — — 仍然存在着严重的暴力冲突。
Sixty-four percent of Brazilian homes lack electricity and sanitation, and only 22% have electricity, a telephone, a computer, a refrigerator, a television, and a washing machine.	百分之六十四的巴西家庭缺少电和卫生设备，只有22%的家庭能用上电、电话、电脑、冰箱、电视和洗衣机。
In the poorest region, the North and Northeast, the numbers fall to 8.6% and 8.3%.	在最贫困的北部和东北部地区，这一数字下降到8.6%和8.3 % 。
Among the young, almost 37% of 18-24-year-olds do not finish high school.	有几乎37%的18到24岁的年轻人没有念完高中。
Only half the population over age 25 has more than eight years of formal education.	25岁以上人口中只有半数接受过8年以上的正规教育。
As for Brazil’s international role, a subtle competition is emerging with the US.	巴西在国际作用领域正在同美国进行着微妙的竞争。
America wants to conclude as many free-trade agreements in the region as it can, while Brazil favors expanding its custom union, Mercosul/Mercosur.	美国希望能在区域内尽可能多的签订自由贸易协议，而巴西则更愿意进一步拓展其关税联盟和南方共同市场（Mercosul/Mercosur ） 。
The entrance of Venezuela into the Brazilian bloc, Brazilian leadership at the United Nations mission in Haiti, and Brazil’s role in the Honduran affair are all part of this emerging competition.	委内瑞拉加入巴西集团、巴西人领导联合国的海地维和行动、以及巴西在洪都拉斯问题上所起的作用都构成了这种正在形成的竞争关系。
If Brazil is to remain on its prosperous path, it must continue to give higher priority to its social and economic programs than to foreign adventures.	如果巴西想在繁荣大道上走得更远，就必须继续给予社会和经济计划比外资企业更多的支持。
The construction of a major egalitarian, free, and democratic society that respects and works with the international institutions is the best thing that Brazil can give to the world right now.	建设尊重国际体系并与之合作的平等、自由和民主的社会是巴西能够献给世界的最好的礼物。
	
Will Technology Kill Convergence?	技术会扼杀趋同吗？
WASHINGTON, DC – At last week’s annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Lima, Peru, one topic that dominated discussions was the slowdown in emerging-economy growth.	华盛顿—在上周世界银行和国际货币基金组织（IMF）在秘鲁利马举行的年会上，一个主导了讨论过程的话题是新兴经济体增长放缓。
Hailed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis as the new engines of the world economy, the emerging economies are now acting as a drag on global growth, and many argue that their era of rapid expansion – and their quest to achieve convergence with advanced-country income levels – is over.	2008年金融危机爆发后，新兴经济体被誉为世界经济体的新增长引擎，但如今，新兴经济体成了全球增长的拖累因素，许多人认为，它们的快速扩张期已经结束，它们对实现向发达国家收入水平趋同的努力也已经结束。
Are the doomsayers right?	这些末日论者说得对吗？
There is certainly reason for concern – beginning in China.	当然，担忧的理由是存在的 — — 从中国开始。
After decades of nearly double-digit growth, China appears to be experiencing a marked slowdown – one that some argue is actually worse than official statistics indicate.	在经历了几十年的近两位数的增长后，中国似乎开始经历显著放缓 — — 有人认为放缓幅度之大实际比官方统计数字更加糟糕。
As China’s growth slows, so does its demand for oil and commodities, with severe effects for other emerging economies that depend on commodity exports.	随着中国增长的放缓，其对石油和大宗商品的需求也放缓了，这给其他依赖大宗商品出口的新兴经济体造成了严重影响。
Moreover, the benefits of lower commodity prices do not seem to have materialized among net importers, except perhaps India; if they have, they have been far from adequate to offset other growth-damaging forces.	此外，大宗商品价格下跌的好处并没有体现在净出口国身上（也许印度是个例外 ） ， 即使获得了好处，也远不足以抵消其他不利于增长的力量。
Meanwhile, the advanced economies are tentatively recovering from the 2008 crisis.	与此同时，发达经济体正在从2008年的危机小心翼翼地复苏。
As a result, the differential between growth in the emerging and advanced economies – aggregated from IMF data, and including Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan in the emerging group – has declined considerably.	结果，新兴和发达经济体之间的增长差异 — — 据IMF数据加总，香港、新加坡、韩国和台湾被归为新兴经济体组 — — 显著收缩。
Indeed, after averaging three percentage points for two decades and rising to 4.8 percentage points in 2010, the percentage-point differential fell to 2.5 last year and is expected to amount to just 1.5 this year.	事实上，二十年来，这一差异平均值为三个百分点，2010年上升到4.8个百分点，去年下降到2.5个百分点，今年预计将继续下降到1.5个百分点。
The question, then, is whether the growth differential will remain as low at it is today.	因此，问题是这一增长差异是否会保持在今天那么低的水平。
Those who believe that it will, typically rely on three arguments, all of which require some qualification.	相信答案是肯定的人通常基于三个原因，这三个原因都值得商榷。
First, they argue that much convergence has already taken place in manufacturing.	首先，他们认为趋同的大部分发生在制造业。
This is true, but it neglects the increasing interconnectedness of manufacturing and services, and the changing nature of many services.	确实如此，但他们忽视了制造业和服务业日益互通的趋势和许多服务业性质的变化。
An iPad, for example, must not just be built; it also needs coding services.	比如，一个iPad不仅仅包括制造过程，还需要编程服务。
In a sense, it is actually more the product of the modern services sector than of manufacturing.	从某种程度讲，iPad实际上更多地是现代服务业产品，而不是制造品。
And there are plenty of untapped opportunities for technological catch-up in, say, health, education, and financial services.	而在（比如）医疗、教育和金融服务方面，有大量技术赶超机会等待新兴市场去把握。
Second, emerging-market bears point out that these economies have gained major productivity benefits from the migration of surplus rural labor to urban areas, a surplus that will soon be exhausted.	其次，新兴市场悲观派指出，这些经济体生产率大提高主要来自农村剩余劳动力向城镇的迁移，而这一剩余劳动力很快就会耗尽。
This, too, is true.	的确如此。
But it ignores the fact that there still is a huge reservoir of urban labor in the informal sector that, upon shifting to the formal sector, would provide an additional boost to productivity.	但它忽视了一个事实：非正式部门仍存在巨大的城镇劳动力储备，只要他们进入正式部门，就能带来新的生产率刺激。
The pessimists’ third argument is that emerging economies are not implementing fast enough the structural reforms needed to support long-term growth.	悲观者的第三个观点是新兴经济体实施支持长期增长所需要的结构改革的步伐不够快。
Again, there is some truth to this argument: structural reforms are needed everywhere.	这一论点也有些道理：结构改革哪里都需要。
But there is no proven way to measure the pace of their implementation.	但没有经受过检验的方法可用于衡量结构改革实施的节奏。
As a result, it is difficult to argue that the emerging economies have collectively slowed in their structural-reform efforts.	因此，很难认为新兴市场在结构改革方面集体滞后了。
But there may be a fourth mechanism at work, related to the changing – and seriously disruptive – nature of new technologies.	但也许还有第四个因素在起作用，即新技术的多变性 — — 以及严重的破坏性。
A major driver of past catch-up, if only in terms of incremental growth, was the shift of many activities in both the services and manufacturing sectors from advanced economies to developing countries with lower wages.	在过去，赶超的一大动力 — — 如果用增量增长衡量的话 — — 是服务业和制造业的许多活动从发达经济体转移到低工资的发展中国家。
Now, however, a growing array of activities can be automated.	但是，如今，越来越多的这些活动可以自动化。
And coding-supported products often have lower costs per unit of output than even very cheap labor can provide.	代码支持的产品的单位产出成本通常比极低价劳动力所能提供的还要低。
So, whereas call centers, for example, used to be mostly staffed in low-wage countries, now the computer-robot that does most of the talking can be located in New York.	因此，尽管（比如）呼叫中心大多在低工资国家运行，但如今，用电脑机器人进行大部分对话的呼叫中心也可以坐落在纽约。
That observation should not, however, overshadow fundamental economic insights – specifically, that trade and the location of production are determined by comparative, not absolute, advantage.	但是，这一观察无法压倒基本经济学洞见 — — 具体而言，就是贸易和生产地由比较优势而非绝对优势决定。
A country will always have a comparative advantage in something; but that something changes.	一国总会在某些方面拥有比较优势；但“某些方面”是会变化的。
Many advanced countries, for example, now have a comparative advantage in high-value-added activities.	比如，许多发达国家现在的比较优势是高增加值活动。
In other words, thanks to their highly skilled labor forces, they are better equipped than their developing-country counterparts for activities like the production of made-to-measure specialized goods or, indeed, anything that requires a highly trained team to work in close proximity.	换句话说，由于它们拥有高技能劳动力，因此比发展中国家更适合生产定制专业化产品或一切需要受过良好训练的团队紧密合作的活动。
But the technology-induced shifts that are underway could portend big disruptions in global value chains – disruptions affecting both developed and developing countries.	但技术导致的正在发生的变迁可能预示着全球价值链的大幅扰动 — — 这些扰动既影响发达国家，也影响发展中国家。
In fact, we may have entered a period of fundamental change that could weaken growth everywhere, as the “old” shrinks before the “new” can occupy sufficient space.	事实上，我们可能已经进入了一个根本性变革时代 ， “ 旧”东西已经破坏而“新”东西尚未占据足够大的空间，所有国家的增长率都可能遭到削弱。
To be sure, the creative destruction that is taking place seems to be affecting developing-economy growth proportionately more than advanced-economy growth, largely because the new technologies are being put to work where they were invented, and developing countries have not yet managed sufficient imitation.	平心而论，正在发生的创造性破坏对发展中经济体的影响似乎相对来说大于发达经济体，这主要是因为，新技术正在发明它们的地方启用，而发展中国家尚无法进行足够的模仿。
But I am not convinced that “catch-up” opportunities will remain diminished – not least because it will always be easier to imitate than to invent.	但我不确定“赶超”机会会一直减少下去 — — 因为模仿总是比发明容易。
In fact, it could be argued that new “leap-frogging” may become possible.	事实上，可以说，新的“蛙跳”会成为可能。
As experience in the telecommunications sector shows, the ability to adopt new technologies without first having to dismantle old systems can enable rapid progress.	通讯业的经验表明，在不必破坏旧体系的情况下采取新技术的能力可以带来快速进步。
The key to enabling continued convergence – even at a fairly rapid pace – is good political governance.	（甚至以相当快的速度）带来持续趋同的关键是良好的政治治理。
Developing-country governments must implement policies aimed at managing the impending transformation, while maintaining social solidarity and cohesion.	发展中国家政府必须实施旨在管理即将到来的转型的政策，同时保持社会团结和凝聚。
That is the challenge they must meet at this time of great disruption.	这是它们在大干扰时代所必须面对的挑战。
	
Will the EU Keep Faith with Turkey?	欧盟会兑现对土耳其的承诺吗？
EMBARGO 6 SEPTEMBER 2004	2004 年 9 月 ， 6 号禁令
More than forty years ago, Turkey applied for associate membership of the European Economic Community.	四十多年前，土耳其申请了欧共体候补成员。
With the Association agreement of 1963, a special relationship was established, culminating in the customs union of 1996.	双方的特殊关系从1963年签订候补协议时开始，并于1996年订立关税联盟时达到了高潮。
During all these years, European governments consistently confirmed Turkey's eligibility for full membership, making accession dependent on compliance with membership criteria.	这些年来，欧洲政府一直承认土耳其的完全会员资格，条件是土耳其要遵守成员国的行为准则。
Turkey's formal recognition as a candidate state in 1999 led Turkey to undertake unprecedented reform efforts in the area of human and minority rights, including abolition of the death penalty, safeguards against torture, promotion of religious freedoms, gender equality, and restriction of the military's role in political life.	1999年正式承认候补资格后，土耳其在人权和少数民族权利领域开始了前所未有的改革，包括取消死刑、反对酷刑、推动宗教自由、性别平等和限制军队在政治生活中的作用。
Should the EU consider the accession criteria as having been fulfilled, it must decide to open negotiations in early 2005.	如果欧盟认为达到了准入条件，就必须在2005年初开始谈判。
Not to do so would mean to renege on political commitments and to severely damage the EU's credibility in the world.	不这么做就意味着不履行政治承诺，会严重损害欧盟的国际信誉。
In many parts of Europe, however, Turkey's admission to the EU is viewed with skepticism owing to its size, relatively poor economy, fears of massive immigration, and, above all, cultural and societal differences - a euphemism for Islam. It would be foolish to deny that some of these factors represent serious challenges.	但欧洲许多国家都对土耳其的加入持怀疑态度，因为它疆域辽阔、经济也欠发达，他们害怕土耳其进入欧盟会引发大规模移民潮，更重要的是，土耳其与欧洲国家存在着文化和社会方面的巨大差异－说得再直接点，土耳其是个伊斯兰国家。
However, they are often exaggerated and certainly not insurmountable.	否认这些因素会带来挑战是愚蠢的，但也不能过分夸大，甚至夸大到无法克服。
Negotiations with Turkey would be lengthy and accession may not occur before 2015.	与土耳其的谈判过程也许会很漫长，2015年前也可能不会有结果。
This period of time would offer both Turkey and the Union an opportunity to come to terms.	但这段时间却给了土耳其和欧盟机会进行自我调整，以便最终达到要求。
With 80 million people, Turkey would be one of the largest EU states.	有着8000万人口，土耳其会是欧盟最大的国家之一。
But the size of a country plays only a limited role in the EU's decision-making process, because political influence within the Union depends more on economic power.	但在欧盟的决策过程中，国家的大小起不了决定作用，因为欧盟内部的政治影响更多地取决于经济方面的实力。
Moreover, for decades Turkey has been a responsible member of many European institutions, and there is no reason to believe that it would act differently in the EU.	此外，几十年来，土耳其一直是很多欧洲机构最忠实的成员，我们没有理由相信加入欧盟会改变这一切。
Because of its weak economy, Turkey would be eligible for substantial EU assistance.	因为经济欠发达，土耳其会得到欧盟的大量援助。
The size of these transfers, however, would depend on the EU's financial policies at the time of admission, the outcome of accession negotiations, and economic developments in Turkey.	但拨款的具体数额要看欧盟当时的金融政策、进入谈判的结果和土耳其自身的经济状况。
In any case, the EU's practice of "capping" its budget would prevent an explosion in the financial costs entailed by Turkey's accession.	不管怎样，欧盟的财政限额政策会防止土耳其加入带来的财政开支大幅增长。
Immigration should not be a cause for undue concern, either.	移民问题也无须引起过多的担心。
Human mobility is limited, and Turkey workers' would probably be allowed to move freely within the EU only after a long transition period, possibly not before 2025.	人员流动是有限的，而且土耳其劳工只有在很长的过渡期后才可以在欧洲自由流动，这种过渡可能一直延续到2025年。
Given the expected upswing of Turkey's economy and its declining birthrate, experts predict a figure of around 2.7 million immigrants by that point.	考虑到土耳其的经济发展和出生率下降，专家预计届时的移民数量可能在270万人。
Meanwhile, diminishing and aging populations in most of Europe will have made immigration a necessity.	与此同时，欧洲多数国家人口数量的减少和年龄的老化有必要依靠移民来补充。
Among the countries from where immigration to the EU is probable, Turkey has the best prospects for successful adaptation.	可能移民到欧盟的国家中，土耳其人最有可能融合成功。
It is Turkey's Muslim population that creates the strongest emotions.	但激起最强烈反对的是土耳其的穆斯林们。
Many feel that Turkey simply does not fit into a European society based on Christian traditions and culture.	很多人认为土耳其根本不可能融入建立在基督教传统和文化基础上的欧洲社会。
It is also feared that Islamists may one day turn Turkey into a fundamentalist state.	人们害怕有一天，伊斯兰份子会把土耳其变成原教旨主义国家。
Unlikely as it may be in view of Turkey's deeply rooted secularism, such a risk cannot be totally excluded.	虽然根深蒂固的世俗主义使这种转变不太可能发生，但毕竟不能完全排除这样的危险。
But the same is true for any other democracy, where radical groups could well misuse the democratic process for their purposes.	但反过来想想，其它民主社会也有同样的问题，激进组织完全可能利用民主进程为自己的目标服务。
Surely, the best protection against such a calamity is to strengthen Turkey's democratic system, which can best be achieved by anchoring it firmly in a bloc of similarly democratic countries.	当然，对这种灾难的最好保护是加强土耳其的民主系统，而最好的办法就是让它在类似的民主国家中深深地扎根。
As for the EU, it must decide whether it wants to be a closed "Christian club" or an open and inclusive society, drawing strength from cultural and religious diversity.	至于欧盟，它必须选择想成为封闭的"基督教俱乐部 " ， 还是开放、包容的社会，从文化和宗教的多元性中汲取力量。
Turkey's accession to the Union would give a powerful answer, one that would be heard with particular clarity in the Islamic world.	土耳其加入欧盟会做出有力的回答，伊斯兰世界会更清楚地感受到这种影响。
The need to refute arguments against Turkey's admission to the EU leaves the advantages rarely mentioned: its unique geopolitical position at the crossroads of the Balkans, Southern Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Middle East - vitally important regions for Europe's security; its role as mayor transit country for energy supplies; its military capabilities at a time when the EU is developing its new European Defense Policy; and the great potential of the Turkish economy, with its young and dynamic labor force.	对反对土耳其入盟论调的驳斥常常使人们忽略了它真正的优势：它地处巴尔干、南高加索、中亚和中东交叉点的独特地理位置－这些地区都对欧洲安全起着至关重要的作用；它还是能源供应的中转站；欧盟制定新欧洲防卫政策时也要借助土耳其的军事力量；土耳其的经济潜力巨大，劳动力年轻、充满活力。
At the same time, the risks of rejecting Turkey must also be taken into account: the likelihood that the reform process would collapse, bringing radical currents to the fore and leading to instability and political unrest at the EU's doorsteps.	与此同时，也必须考虑拒绝土耳其的危险：改革进程可能半途而废、极端势力可能走到前台，在欧洲大门口造成局势不稳和政治动荡。
Turkish EU membership presents both opportunities and challenges.	土耳其成为欧盟成员既是机遇、又是挑战。
On balance, however, the advantages far outweigh the risks.	但权衡利弊，利益会远远超过风险。
	
Will the Euro Dethrone the Dollar?	欧元会取代美元的位置吗？
Much of America’s dominance in world finance comes from the dollar’s status as international money.	美国在世界金融中的霸主地位很大一部分来自于美元作为国际货币的地位。
America’s commitment to free capital markets, the rule of law, and price stability confer credibility on the dollar as a store of value.	美国对自由的资本市场、法治以及价格稳定的承诺带给美元作为价值储备的可信度。
But American spending habits have undermined the dollar’s reputation, with the excess supply of dollars on world markets depressing its price.	但是，美国人的消费习惯破坏了美元的声誉，而美元在世界市场上的过度供应又压抑了它的价格。
This spring, the euro’s exchange rate against the dollar reached an all-time high, and central banks have increased the euro share of their international reserves.	今年春天，欧元与美元的汇率达到了历史新高，各国的中央银行也增加了欧元在其国际储备中的份额。
Is the dollar about to lose the crown of world finance to the euro?	美元是否要将世界金融的皇冠拱手让给欧元呢？
History suggests otherwise, despite a vulnerable dollar.	历史表明，尽管美元软弱，但是情况还是相反。
American financial supremacy in the twenty-first century resembles Britain’s position in world finance a century ago.	美国在二十一世纪的金融霸主地位和英国在一个世纪前的地位相似。
Before the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the pound sterling served as the currency of choice for international transactions, just as the dollar does today, and the world’s borrowers visited the City of London to raise capital.	在1914年8月第一次世界大战爆发之前，英镑正如当今的美元一样是国际交易的首选货币，全世界的借款者都造访伦敦时来筹集资本。
The British economist John Maynard Keynes worried that countries would not use sterling to settle trading balances with each other if the pound were not viewed as a reliable store of value.	英国经济学家凯恩斯担心，如果人们不把英镑看作可靠的价值储备，那么，各国就不会用英镑来结算各自的交易结余。
The “future position of the City of London,” according to Keynes, depended on the pound sterling continuing to serve the business world as the equivalent of gold.	凯恩斯认为 ， “ 伦敦市的未来地位”取决于英镑继续作为黄金的等价物为工商界服务。
Britain maintained the pound’s convertibility into gold at the outbreak of the Great War to preserve its credibility as the international medium of exchange.	英国在第一次世界大战爆发之际维持英镑可兑换为黄金来维持其国际交易媒介的信誉。
The dollar could not challenge sterling’s role as the world’s currency without matching its reputation.	美元不追赶上英镑的声誉就无法挑战英镑世界货币的作用。
August 1914 provided the opportunity.	1914年8月提供了这样的一个机遇。
The biggest gold outflow in a generation imperiled America’s ability to repay its debts abroad.	在整整一代人中最大的一次黄金外流破坏了美国偿还海外债务的能力。
Fear that the US would abandon the gold standard sent the dollar plummeting on world markets.	人们担心美国将会放弃金本位制，美元在世界市场上暴跌。
But Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo secured American financial honor in August 1914 by remaining true to gold while everyone else, except for the British, abandoned their obligations.	但是，正当除了英国以外的其他所有国家都放弃其义务之际，美国财政部长麦克阿杜在1914年8月坚持金本位不变，从而为美国赢得了金融信誉。
Despite the dollar’s instant credibility, however, it took more than a decade for America’s currency to match Britain’s as an international medium of exchange.	但是，尽管美元声誉日隆，美国货币追赶上英镑作为国际交易媒介还是花了十年多的时间。
Payment habits melt at a glacier’s pace.	支付习惯改变决非一朝一夕。
Britain’s transformation from international creditor to international debtor during the Great War gave the dollar a second wind in its battle with sterling.	英国在第一次世界大战中从国际债权人沦为国际债务人，从而给了美元在与英镑的较量中的第二次生机。
The British were forced to abandon gold convertibility in April 1919 – a tactical withdrawal intended to pave the way for Britain’s return to the former $4.8665 parity with the American dollar.	英国被迫在1919年4月放弃黄金兑换，这是英国准备回到从前一英镑兑换4.8665美元等价的战术性撤退。
Six years later, in April 1925, Britain confirmed its monetary credibility and returned to the gold standard.	六年之后，在1925年4月，英国确认其货币信誉并且返回金本位制。
But the pound had already suffered irreparable damage.	但是英镑已经遭受了不可弥补的损害。
The experience of 1914 implies that a credible alternative can replace an entrenched world currency, especially after an unfavorable balance of trade has weakened it.	1914年的经验表明，具有可信度的替换货币可以取代地位牢靠的世界货币，特别是在不良贸易平衡削弱这一货币之后。
But even then, dethroning the reigning king of international exchange takes time.	但是即使在那时，夺取国际交易国王宝座还是要假以时日。
Today, the euro – a currency without a country – lacks a long track record of credibility.	如今，欧元这一没有国度的货币缺乏长久的信誉历史记录。
Thirteen countries in the European Union use the euro as money.	欧盟的十三个国家使用欧元作为货币。
But the commitment of these independent political entities to the euro cannot match the history of America’s commitment to the dollar.	但是这些独立政治实体对欧元的承诺却无法与美国对美元的承诺历史相提并论。
The European Central Bank, established in 1998, has a mandate to manage the new currency to maintain price stability.	欧洲中央银行建立于1998年，其使命是管理这一新货币来维持价格稳定。
But the ECB needs time to establish its inflation-fighting credentials.	但是欧洲央行需要时间来建立其与通货膨胀作斗争的资格。
It cannot hitch a ride on gold, the way America did a century ago.	它无法像美国在一个世纪以前那样搭黄金的车。
So the euro must earn its reputation crisis by crisis to confront the dollar’s dominance as the currency of choice for international transactions.	所以欧元必须通过一个又一个危机来赢得其声誉来对抗美元作为国际交易首选货币的霸主地位。
Recent experience with the euro as an official reserve asset is instructive.	欧元作为官方储备资产近来的经历颇能说明情况。
Between 2000 and 2005, the dollar lost more than 25% of its value against the euro.	2000年至2005年期间，美元对欧元贬值25 ％ 。
Meanwhile, the fraction of international reserves held in euros grew from 18% to 24%, and the dollar’s share dropped from 71% to 66%.	与此同时，欧元在国际储备中持有率从18％上升到24 ％ ， 而美元则从71％下降到66 ％ 。
In short, the euro has clearly made some headway during this period of US balance of payment deficits, but this reflects an evolutionary decline in the dollar’s dominance, not a revolutionary regime shift.	简而言之，欧元在美国收支平衡赤字期间显然取得了进步，但是这反映出美元霸主地位的演变性下降，而非革命性的大局变动。
What might trigger a fatal run on the dollar in world markets?	有什么事件可能会触发国际市场上致命性的挤兑美元呢？
While a broad and abrupt sell-off by major foreign holders of dollars – for example, China – appears unlikely, a cataclysmic event, similar to the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, could prompt a search for a new international medium of exchange.	尽管主要的外国美元持有者例如中国突然间大范围抛售美元看起来不大可能，但是，某一类似于1914年第一次世界大战爆发那样的灾难性事件有可能促使人们寻求一种新的国际交易媒介。
In the modern era of automated payments, the upheaval might come from a terrorist attack that undermines the computerized transfer facilities of the world’s banking system.	在现代自动支付年代里，这一动荡可能来自某一破坏世界银行体系计算机化的转移设施的恐怖主义袭击。
A catastrophic loss of electronic records could surely destroy the credibility of the dollar as the international medium of exchange.	电子记录灾难性的丢失几乎会摧毁美元作为国际交易媒介的信誉。
But exactly what would replace the dollar under such circumstances remains an open question.	但是在这种情况下什么会取代美元还是一个没有答案的问题。
After all, a loss of computer records would make the euro equally suspect.	毕竟，丢失计算机记录也会让欧元也一样可疑。
Perhaps gold, a store of value impervious to physical distortion, could make a comeback.	黄金是可以抵御物理变形的价值储备，也许它会卷土重来。
Of course, one can only hope that such a scenario remains pure conjecture.	当然，人们只能希望这种情形只是一种臆测而已。
	
Will the Euro Survive the Current Crisis?	欧元经得住当前的危机吗？
CAMBRIDGE – The European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and the euro are about to celebrate their tenth anniversary.	剑桥－欧洲经济与货币联盟(EMU)和欧元快要进行十周年庆了。
The euro was introduced without serious problems and has since functioned well, with the European Central Bank delivering the low inflation that is its sole mandate.	欧元的引进没有产生严重的问题，并且此后运行良好，与此同时欧洲中央银行将低通胀作为其首要任务
But the current economic crisis may provide a severe test of the euro’s ability to survive in more troubled times.	但是，当前的经济危机可能对欧元在更困难时期继续运行下去的能力提出了严峻的考验。
While the crisis could strengthen the institutions provided by the EMU, it could also create multiple risks, of which member countries need to be aware if they want to avoid them.	虽然当前的经济危机可能加强欧洲经济与货币联盟提供的制度机构，但是也可能产生多重风险。 如果欧洲经济与货币联盟的成员国想要避免这些风险，它们就必须意识到这些风险。
The primary problem is that conditions in individual EMU members may develop in such different ways that some national political leaders could be tempted to conclude that their countries would be better served by adopting a mix of policies different from that of the other members.	主要问题是，单个的欧洲经济与货币联盟成员国国情的发展可能非常不同，以至于一些国家的政治领导人可能倾向于认为，他们的国家通过采取和其他成员国不同的各种政策，对国家更为有利。
The current differences in the interest rates of euro-zone government bonds show that the financial markets regard a break-up as a real possibility.	目前欧元区政府债券利率的差异表明，金融市场认为欧洲经济与货币联盟的分裂是一个现实的可能。
Ten-year government bonds in Greece and Ireland, for example, now pay nearly a full percentage point above the rate on comparable German bonds, and Italy’s rate is almost as high.	例如，希腊和爱尔兰的十年期政府债券现在支付的利率，和可比较的德国政府债券比起来，几乎整整高了一个百分点，而意大利的债券利率几乎也一样高。
There have, of course, been many examples in history in which currency unions or single-currency states have broken up.	当然，历史上有很多货币联盟或单一货币国家分裂的例子。
Although there are technical and legal reasons why such a split would be harder for an EMU country, there seems little doubt that a country could withdraw if it really wanted to.	虽然对欧洲经济与货币联盟成员国来说，因为技术和法律上的原因，这样的分裂更为困难，但是，如果欧洲经济与货币联盟成员国真地想退出，就可以退出，人们对此的疑问似乎很少。
The most obvious reason that a country might choose to withdraw is to escape from the one-size-fits-all monetary policy imposed by the single currency.	欧洲经济与货币联盟成员国可能选择退出的最明显的原因，是为了避免因为单一货币所造成的不区分具体情形而适用于所有成员国的货币政策。
A country that finds its economy very depressed during the next few years, and fears that this will be chronic, might be tempted to leave the EMU in order to ease monetary conditions and devalue its currency.	一个发现其经济在未来几年会很萧条而且担心萧条会延续很长时间的成员国，可能会为了缓和其货币状况并且使其货币贬值，而倾向于离开欧洲经济与货币联盟。
Although that may or may not be economically sensible, a country in a severe economic downturn might very well take such a policy decision.	虽然这样做在经济上可能是明智的，也可能是不明智的，但是，一个遭受严重经济下滑的国家极有可能做出这样的政策决策
The Stability and Growth Pact, which limits euro-zone members’ fiscal deficits, is another reason why a country might want to leave the EMU.	限制欧元区成员国财政赤字的《稳定和增长公约 》 ， 是另一个欧洲经济与货币联盟成员国想退出联盟的原因。
In a serious downturn, a country may wish to pursue a traditional Keynesian policy through large-scale, deficit-financed fiscal stimulus.	在经济严重下滑的时候，一个国家可能希望通过大规模的扩大财政赤字的财政刺激方案，来实施传统的凯恩斯政策。
Although the Stability and Growth Pact may be elastic enough to permit some deficit stimulus, a country may feel constrained from acting as aggressively as it wants.	虽然《稳定和增长公约》可能有足够的弹性来允许一些成员国的赤字刺激方案，但是，有些国家仍然可能会觉得不能像自己想的那样采取激进的措施。
The current financial crisis raises yet another problem: the lack of a clear “lender of last resort.”	当前的金融危机还提出了另一个问题：缺少一个明确的“最后贷款人 ” 。
It remains to be seen how willing the ECB will be to provide national central banks with the volume of euros needed to play this role fully.	欧洲中央银行给欧洲经济与货币联盟成员国的中央银行提供完全扮演这一角色所需的欧元数量的意愿，还有待观察。
If a country sees its banks failing because its national bank cannot lend them enough, it may chose to leave the EMU so that its central bank can provide whatever amount of local currency it deems necessary.	如果一个国家因为它的国家银行不能借给它足够的钱，而认为其银行不起作用，它可能会选择退出欧洲经济与货币联盟，以便其中央银行能够提供其认为必要的无论多大数量的本国货币。
Moreover, the current economic crisis has led to renewed talk about the need for the European Union to have taxing authority.	而且，目前的经济危机导致了对欧盟拥有征税权力必要性的重新讨论。
Whatever the logic of that proposition, it would open the door to much greater income redistribution.	不管这种必要性主张的逻辑是什么，它都会为更大的收入再分配打开大门。
High-income countries might find that reason enough to want out.	高收入国家可能会发现这个理由对退出欧洲经济与货币联盟来说，已经足够了。
Even if officials do not want to abandon the euro, they may come to do so as a result of a strategy of trying to get other countries to agree to a policy change.	即使官员们不想放弃欧元，但是，作为使其他成员国同意进行政策变化的策略的结果，他们也有可能这样做。
A country that believes that monetary or fiscal policy is too tight may threaten to leave if policy is not changed.	一个认为货币或财政政策太紧的国家，可能会扬言如果不改变政策，就退出欧洲经济与货币联盟。
That is clearly a substantial risk if the country is Germany or France.	如果上述国家是德国或法国的话，这显然是一个重大的风险。
But even if it is one of the smaller countries, it might be a serious threat because it could be seen as the beginning of the end.	但是，即便是欧洲经济与货币联盟中的一个小国，这也可能是一个严重的威胁，因为它会被看成是结束的开始。
So either type of country could make the threat in the hope that it would be enough to cause their EMU colleagues to agree to their desired change in policy.	因此，大国和小国都能发出威胁，并希望这些威胁就足够使其欧洲经济与货币联盟中的同事同意他们想要的政策变化。
The risk, of course, is that the other countries may not be intimidated.	当然，这样做的风险是其他国家可能不受胁迫。
The threatening country would then have to choose whether to accepting a humiliating defeat and stay, or stand on “principle” and leave.	那么，发出威胁的国家将不得不选择是接受羞辱性的失败留下来，还是坚持“原则”退出。
All of this assumes that political leaders would select only a policy change that they think will be in their nation’s long-term interest.	所有这些，都是假设政治领导人只选择了他们认为符合其国家长远利益的一个政策变化。
But there is also a risk that some politicians act solely out of self-interest, seizing on the economic downturn as an opportunity to get elected by promising to withdraw the country from the EMU, or by saying that they will threaten to do so if the other member countries do not agree to their proposed policy changes.	但是，也有一些政治家仅仅出于自身利益，通过承诺使国家退出欧洲经济与货币联盟，或者声称如果其他成员国不同意他们提议的政策变化他们就扬言退出的方式，抓住经济下滑问题，将其作为使自己当选的机会。
None of these risks implies that the monetary union will inevitably be a victim of this severe economic downturn.	这些风险中的任何一个都不意味着，货币联盟将不可避免的成为此次严重经济下滑的牺牲品。
But the downturn will be a more severe test for the euro than any that it faced during its first ten years.	但是，经济下滑和欧元在其第一个十年中面临的其他考验相比，要严峻得多。
	
Will the IMF Stand Up to Europe?	IMF会力挺欧洲吗？
CAMBRIDGE – As the eurozone crisis continues to deepen, the International Monetary Fund may finally be acknowledging the need to reassess its approach.	坎布里奇 — — 随着欧元区危机的继续深化，IMF或将不得不承认有必要反思其作为了。
New Managing Director Christine Lagarde’s recent call for forced recapitalization of Europe’s bankrupt banking system is a good start.	新总裁拉加德最近提出应该对欧洲已经破产的银行体系强行予以重组，这是个不错的开始。
European officials’ incensed reaction – the banks are fine, they insist, and need only liquidity support – should serve to buttress the Fund’s determination to be sensible about Europe.	欧洲官员被激怒了，他们坚持说，银行们一切都好，需要的只是流动性支持。 欧洲官员的态度应该能够支持IMF对欧洲的判断的可靠性。
Until now, the Fund has sycophantically supported each new European initiative to rescue the over-indebted eurozone periphery, committing more than $100 billion to Greece, Portugal, and Ireland so far.	到目前为止，对于欧洲所提出的任何救助债务深重的欧元区外围国家的方案，IMF无不大力支持，其热情程度甚至有阿谀奉承之嫌。 希勒、葡萄牙和爱尔兰已经获得了超过1000亿美元援助承诺。
Unfortunately, the IMF is risking not only its members’ money, but, ultimately, its own institutional credibility.	不幸的是，IMF这么做不仅是在拿其成员国的钱冒险，更严重的是，归根到底，它所押上的赌注是自己的机构名誉。
Only a year ago, at the IMF’s annual meeting in Washington, DC, senior staff were telling anyone who would listen that the whole European sovereign-debt panic was a tempest in a teapot.	一年前，在IMF华盛顿年会上，只要你愿意听，高级官员就会告诉你，整个欧洲主权债务危机纯属小题大做。
Using slick PowerPoint presentations with titles like “Default in Today’s Advanced Economies: Unnecessary, Undesirable, and Unlikely,” the Fund tried to convince investors that eurozone debt was solid as a rock.	IMF制作了精美的PPT，打着《今日发达经济体的违约：没有必要、不受欢迎、断无可能》之类的标题，试图让投资者相信，欧元区坚如磐石。
Even for Greece, the IMF argued, debt dynamics were not a serious concern, thanks to anticipated growth and reforms.	即使对于希腊，IMF也认为其债务动态并无值得深虑的必要，因为该地区增长强劲，而且会实施改革。
Never mind the obvious flaw in the Fund’s logic, namely that countries such as Greece and Portugal face policy and implementation risks far more akin to emerging markets than to truly advanced economies such as Germany and the United States.	IMF这么说存在明显的逻辑漏洞：希腊和葡萄牙这样的国家，它们所面临的政策和实施政策的风险更接近于新兴市场，而不是德国和美国这样的真正发达国家。 但那又怎么样呢。
As the situation deteriorated, one might have guessed that the IMF would mark its beliefs to market, as it were, and adopt a more cautious tone.	随着情况的恶化，你也许会认为IMF将向往常一样信赖市场，并在放话时采取更加谨慎的语调。
Instead, at the IMF’s April 2011 interim meeting, a senior official declared that the Fund now considers troubled Spain to be a core eurozone country like Germany, rather than a peripheral country like Greece, Portugal, or Ireland.	但是，在2011年4月的IMF中期会议上，一位高级官员宣称，IMF将陷入困境的西班牙视为和德国同等的欧元区核心国家，而不是像希腊、葡萄牙和爱尔兰这样的外围国家。
Evidently, investors were supposed to infer that for all practical purposes they should think of Spanish and German debt as identical – the old hubris of the eurozone.	显然，他们认为务实的投资者会因此推断，西班牙和德国债务完全等价 — — 此乃欧元区固有的傲慢。
My own sarcastic reaction was to think, “Oh, now the IMF thinks that some of the core eurozone countries are a default risk.”	我不无讽刺地想 ： “ 哦，现在IMF认为某些欧元区核心国家也存在违约风险了 。 ”
Having served as the IMF’s chief economist from 2001 to 2003, I am familiar with the Fund’s need to walk a tightrope between building investor confidence and shaking up complacent policymakers.	作为2001—2003年IMF首席经济学家，我十分熟悉IMF的处境 — — 它需要在提振投资者的信心和威慑踌躇满志的政客之间走钢丝。
But it is one thing to be circumspect in the midst of a crisis; it is quite another to spew nonsense.	但在危机中保持细心周到是一回事，信口胡说则是完全不同的另一回事。
The late Chicago-school economist George Stigler would have described the IMF’s role in Europe as reflecting acute “regulatory capture.”	已故的芝加哥学派经济学家乔治·斯蒂格勒会把IMF在欧洲的角色称为病入膏肓的“监管俘虏 ” 。
Simply put, Europe and the US control too much power in the IMF, and their thinking is too dominant.	在IMF，欧洲和美国把持了太多的权力，在行为方式中占据了太大的主导地位。
What European leaders may want most from the Fund are easy loans and strong rhetorical support.	欧洲领导人最希望从IMF手中获得的是宽松的贷款和给力的口头支持。
But what Europe really needs is the kind of honest assessment and tough love that the Fund has traditionally offered to its other, less politically influential, clients.	但欧洲实际上需要的是诚实的评估和苦口良药，即IMF传统上对政治影响力较低的客户所做的那些事。
The IMF’s blind spot in dealing with Europe until now is only partly due to European voting power.	在应对欧洲问题上，IMF至今仍存在盲区，欧洲在IMF所拥有的投票权只是原因之一。
It also stems from an “us” and “them” mentality that similarly permeates research at the top Wall Street investment houses.	“我们”和“他们”有别的心态也是IMF不能客观行事的原因，这一点在华尔街顶级投资机构的研究中也存在。
Analysts who have worked their entire lives only on advanced economies have learned to bet on things going well, because for the couple of decades prior to the crisis, things mostly did go well – very well.	一辈子都在研究发达经济体的分析师得到的经验是凡事朝好的方向看，因为从危机前的20年来看，一切都会好的 — — 是大好不是小好。
That is why, for example, so many keep assuming that a normal rapid recovery is just around the corner.	这就是为什么很多人认为正常的快速复苏马上就会到来的原因。
But the financial crisis should have reminded everyone that the distinction between advanced economies and emerging markets is not a bright red line.	但金融危机提醒所有人，发达经济体和新兴市场之间的区别并不是不可跨越的鸿沟。
In his recent speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke forcefully complained that political paralysis has possibly become the principal impediment to recovery.	在最新的俄怀明州杰克森霍尔讲话中，美联储主席伯南克大力抨击了政治僵局，指出这可能已经成为复苏的最大障碍。
But analysts accustomed to working on emerging markets understand that such paralysis is very difficult to avoid after a financial crisis.	但习惯于研究新兴市场的分析师早就明白，类似的政治僵局在金融危机爆发后是很难避免的。
Rather than slavishly believing policymakers’ assurances, emerging-market researchers have learned to be cynical about official promises.	新兴市场研究员才不会盲信政客的信誓旦旦，他们早就学会了对官方承诺持怀疑态度。
All too often, everything that can be done wrong will be done wrong.	只要是可能做错的事，最后无一幸免地都出了错，这样例子发生得还少吗？
The IMF needs to bring much more of this brand of skepticism to its assessment of eurozone debt dynamics, instead of constantly seeking strained assumptions that would make the debt appear sustainable.	IMF需要更多地怀疑它对欧元区债务动态所做的评估，而不是不遗余力地寻找站不住脚的假设证明债务仍然可持续。
Anyone looking closely at Europe’s complex options for extricating itself from its debt straightjacket should realize that political constraints will be a huge obstacle no matter which route Europe takes.	任何近距离观察欧洲为将自己救出债务缠身状态所面临的复杂选择的人都应该意识到，不管欧洲选择哪条路，政治约束将成为巨大障碍。
Even outside Europe, the IMF has long given too much credence to sitting governments, rather than focusing on the long-term interests of the country and its people.	即使在欧洲之外，IMF也总是过分迁就在任政府，而不是专注于一国及其人民的长期利益。
The Fund is doing Europe’s people no favor by failing to push aggressively for a more realistic solution, including dramatic debt write-downs for peripheral eurozone countries and re-allocating core-country guarantees elsewhere.	为欧洲人民着想，IMF应该大力推行更现实的解决方案，包括对外围欧元区国家的大规模债务减记并重新分配核心国家对其他国家的担保。
Now that the Fund has squarely acknowledged the huge capital holes in many European banks, it should start pressing forcefully for a comprehensive and credible solution to the eurozone debt crisis, a solution that will involve either partial breakup of the eurozone or fundamental constitutional reform.	如今，IMF已经承认大量欧洲银行存在巨大的资本漏洞，那么，它应该开始大力推行全面可信的欧元区债务危机解决方案了。 这一方案包括部分分解欧元区以及基础宪政改革。
Europe’s future, not to mention the future of the IMF, depends on it.	欧洲的未来（更不用说IMF了）便系于此。
	
Will the Polluters Pay for Climate Change?	污染者会为气候变化付出代价吗？
I am writing this in New York in early August, when the mayor declared a “heat emergency” to prevent widespread electricity outages from the expected high use of air conditioners.	我八月上旬在纽约写这篇文章，当时，纽约市长宣布实行“高温紧急状态”来防止由于预期的大量使用空调而造成的大范围停电。
City employees could face criminal charges if they set their thermostats below 78 degrees Fahrenheit (25.5 Celsius).	市政雇员如果把他们的空调温度调到华氏78度 (摄氏25.5度) 以下就会面临刑事指控。
Nevertheless, electricity usage has reached near-record levels.	但是，用电量还是接近历史最高记录。
Meanwhile California has emerged from its own record-breaking heat wave.	与此同时，加利福尼亚刚刚走出该州自己的破记录的热浪。
For the United States as a whole, the first six months of 2006 were the hottest in more than a century.	美国全国而言，2006年的头六个月是一个多世纪内最热的。
Europe is experiencing an unusually hot summer, too.	欧洲也在经历一个不同寻常的酷暑。
July set new records in England and the Netherlands, where weather data go back more than 300 years.	英国和荷兰的七月份气温都创下新高，这两个国家的天气数据记录超过300年。
The hot northern summer fits well with the release of An Inconvenient Truth, a documentary film featuring former US Vice-President Al Gore.	北半球的酷暑与美国前副总统戈尔主持的电影纪录片“烦恼的真相”不谋而合。
Using some remarkable graphs, images, and other information, the film makes a compelling case that our carbon dioxide emissions are causing global warming, or, at the very least, contributing to it, and that we must urgently address the issue.	这部电影使用一些生动的图表、画面以及其他信息，有力地阐明了人类的二氧化碳排放造成全球气候变暖，或者至少是促进气候变暖，并且大力呼吁处理这一问题是当务之急。
Americans tend to talk a lot about morality and justice.	美国人趋向于对道德和正义高谈阔论。
But most Americans still fail to realize that their country’s refusal to sign the Kyoto protocol, and their subsequent business–as-usual approach to greenhouse gas emissions, is a moral failing of the most serious kind.	但是大多数美国人依然没有认识到他们的国家拒绝签署京都议定书、对温室气体排放采取一切照旧的做法是最为严重的道德败坏事情。
It is already having harmful consequences for others, and the greatest inequity is that it is the rich who are using most of the energy that leads to the emissions that cause climate change, while it is the poor who will bear most of the costs.	这已经给其他人造成了有害的影响，而最大的不公平就是，富人使用绝大部分导致排放的能源造成气候变化，而穷人将会承担大部分代价。
(To see what you can do to reduce your own contribution, go to www.climatecrisis.net.)	(如果想要了解自己如何做来减少气体排放，请访问网站www.climatecrisis.net ) 。
To see the inequity, I merely have to glance up at the air conditioner that is keeping my office bearable.	我只要看一下让我的办公室呆得住人的空调就可以知道这一不公了。
While I’ve done more than the mayor requested, setting it at 82F (27C), I’m still part of a feedback loop.	尽管我做的比市长要求的还要好，把温度设定在82华氏度(摄氏27度 ) ， 我仍然是反馈回路的一部分。
I deal with the heat by using more energy, which leads to burning more fossil fuel, putting more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and heating up the planet more.	我通过使用更多的能源来对付酷热，导致燃烧更多的矿物燃料、把更多的温室气体排入大气层并且让地球更加炎热。
It even happened when I watched An Inconvenient Truth: on a warm evening, the cinema was so chilly that I wished I had brought a jacket.	即使是我在观看“烦恼的真相”的时候也是如此。 那是一个炎热的晚上，电影院冷气逼人，以至于我希望我带来一件夹克。
Heat kills.	酷热可以致命。
A heat wave in France in 2003 caused an estimated 35,000 deaths, and a hot spell similar to the one Britain had last month caused more than 2,000 deaths, according to official estimates.	根据官方估计，2003年法国的一场热浪造成大约35000人死亡，上个月英国一场类似的热浪造成2000多人死亡。
Although no particular heat wave can be directly attributed to global warming, it will make such events more frequent.	尽管没有一场特别的热浪可以直接归咎于全球变暖，但是它将会让这样的事件更为频繁。
Moreover, if global warming continues unchecked, the number of deaths that occur when rainfall becomes more erratic, causing both prolonged droughts and severe floods, will dwarf the death toll from hot weather in Europe.	而且，如果对全球变暖继续不加以节制，那么，当降雨变得更为不规则，造成持续的干旱和严重的洪灾时所发生的死亡人数将会让欧洲炎热天气而致命的数目小巫见大巫。
More frequent intense hurricanes will kill many more.	更为频繁的强烈飓风将会让让更多的人死亡。
Melting polar ice will cause rising seas to inundate low-lying fertile delta regions on which hundreds of millions of people grow their food.	融化的极地冰川将会造成海平面上升，淹没数以亿计的人口种植粮食的低洼地带三角洲良田。
Tropical diseases will spread, killing still more people.	热带疾病将会扩散，让更多的人死亡。
Overwhelmingly, the dead will be those who lack the resources to adapt, to find alternative sources of food, and who do not have access to health care.	死亡者中的绝大多数人将是那些缺乏资源适应、寻找替换食物资源以及那些没有医疗保障的人。
Even in rich countries, it usually isn’t the rich who die in natural disasters.	即使在富国，通常也不是那些富人死于自然灾害。
When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, those who died were the poor in low-lying areas who lacked cars to escape.	当卡特琳娜飓风袭击奥尔良的时候，那些遇害的人都是在低洼地带缺少汽车逃命的穷人。
If this is true in a country like the US, with a reasonably efficient infrastructure and the resources to help its citizens in times of crisis, it is even more evident when disasters strike developing countries, because their governments lack the resources needed, and because, when it comes to foreign assistance, rich nations still do not count all human lives equally.	如果这发生在像美国这样具有大体有效的基础设施以及在危难时候帮助其国民的资源的国家，那么，当灾难袭击发展中国家之时，由于它们的政府缺少必需的资源，而且由于富国在对外援助时并不平等看待人命，情况就会更为明显了。
According to United Nations figures, in 2002 per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in the US were 16 times higher than in India, 60 times higher than in Bangladesh, and more than 200 times higher than in Ethiopia, Mali, or Chad.	根据联合国的数据，2002年美国的人均温室气体排放高出印度16倍，孟加拉国60倍，比埃塞俄比亚、马里或者乍得高出200倍以上。
Other developed nations with emissions close to those of the US include Australia, Canada, and Luxembourg.	排放水平接近美国的其��发达国家包括澳大利亚、加拿大以及卢森堡。
Russia, Germany, Britain, Italy, France, and Spain all have levels between a half and a quarter that of the US.	俄国、德国、英国、意大利、法国以及西班牙的排放水平都只是美国的四分之一到一半之间。
This is still significantly above the world average, and more than 50 times that of the poorest nations in which people will die from global warming.	这还是比世界平均高出很多，比最贫困国家高出50倍以上。 这些国家的人死于全球气候变暖。
If a polluter harms others, those who are harmed normally have a legal remedy.	如果一个污染者损害了他人，受害者往往有法律救济。
For example, if a factory leaks toxic chemicals into a river that I use to irrigate my farm, killing my crops, I can sue the factory owner.	例如，如果一家工厂向我用来灌溉农田的河流渗漏了有毒化学品，杀死了我的作物，那么我可以起诉工厂的主人。
If the rich nations pollute the atmosphere with carbon dioxide, causing my crops to fail because of changing rainfall patterns, or my fields are inundated by a rise in the sea level, shouldn’t I also be able to sue?	如果富国用二氧化碳污染大气，让我的作物由于降雨模式改变而歉收，或者我的农田由于海平面上升而被淹没，那么，我难道就不能起诉吗？
Camilla Toulmin, who directs the International Institute for Environment and Development, a London-based NGO, was present at a lecture on climate change that Al Gore gave in June.	国际环境和发展研究所是一家总部设在伦敦的非政府组织。 今年6月份，戈尔作气候变化演讲的时候，该所主任图明也在场。
She asked him what he thought about compensation for those who are hit hardest by climate change, but who have done the least to cause it.	她问戈尔如何看待给那些受到气候变化打击最大、但却对气候变化作用最小的人予以补偿的问题。
The question, she reports on www.opendemocracy.net, seemed to take him by surprise, and he did not support the idea.	她在www.opendemocracy.net网站上汇报说，这一问题让戈尔措手不及，而且他也不支持这一观点。
Like Toulmin, I wonder if this is a truth that is just too inconvenient, even for him.	向图明一样，我不知道这一真相即使对戈尔来说也是太过烦恼。
	
Will the Rumsfeld Revolution Continue?	拉姆斯菲尔德的革命会继续吗？
America’s defense policy is at a crossroads.	美国的国防政策正处于转折点上。
Since 1997, the United States Congress has required the Department of Defense to undertake a major defense review every four years.	自1997年以来，美国国会就要求国防部每隔四年进行一次全面的国防评估。
The department is currently developing the third such review and will release it later this year.	国防部目前正在进行第三次这样的评估，评估结果将在年底揭晓。
The review promises to be nothing short of a watershed.	这项评估据称将会具有分水岭式的意义。
The last Quadrennial Defense Review was published a few weeks after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.	上一次四年一度的评估在2001年9月11日恐怖袭击以后的数周发布。
As a result, it gave only hints of the counterterrorism strategy to come.	所以它只对未来的反恐战略做了些许提示。
The 2005 review, by contrast, will represent several years of thinking by the Bush administration, and thus will serve as a key indicator of the future course of American defense policy.	相较之下，2005年的评估将会代表布什政府几年以来的思考成果，因而会成为美国未来国防政策的一项重要指标。
The grand strategy that serves as the foundation for American defense policy has not undergone major change since 2002.	作为美国国防政策基础的大方向战略自2002年以来没有发生重大变化。
Focusing on terrorism, the strategy calls for strengthening the network of international partners seeking to eradicate transnational terrorism, and for direct action against terrorist organizations and their sponsors.	以恐怖主义为重心，该战略呼吁加强寻求根除跨国恐怖主义的国际伙伴网络，同时还呼吁对恐怖组织及其赞助者采取直接行动。
Ultimately, it seeks to address what President Bush considers the root causes of terrorism, particularly the absence of open political systems and economic opportunity.	最终，这一战略的目的是要根治布什总统认为的恐怖主义发生的根源，特别是开放的政治体系和经济机遇的缺失。
What is changing is the way that US military power is used to implement this grand strategy.	正发生着变化的，是美国用于实施这一宏大战略的军事力量。
There is little doubt that the 2005 Defense Review will formalize the change in focus underway since September 11, 2001.	几乎可以肯定，在《2005国防评估》中会正式确认自2001年“9.11”以来的这种变化。
Before that, the American military concentrated on swift victory in a major theater war against another state’s military forces.	在此之前，美国军方的注意力主要放在针对他国军力的速战速决的做秀式的战争。
Today, however, the US military is more likely to be used to stabilize and rebuild failed states, assist partners in countering insurgency and terrorism, control nuclear weapons when regimes collapse, or directly eradicate terrorist organizations and their supporters.	但现在，美国的军力更可能会被用来稳定和重建战败国，帮助伙伴国对抗叛乱和恐怖主义，在政权崩溃时控制核武器，或直接铲除恐怖组织及其支持者。
This requires a different type of force, and one capable of running a marathon rather than a sprint, sustaining major deployments for extended periods.	这就需要另一种军事力量，一种可以跑马拉松而不是100米的军事力量，以适应长期性的重要部署。
The global configuration of America’s military is also changing.	美军的全球部署也发生着变化。
The goal is to keep most of the force stationed at home in the US, with a network of lightly-manned bases abroad that can serve as forward operating locations during a crisis or war.	其目标是将大部分的军力驻扎在美国本土，同时在国外保持驻军不多的基地网络以便在危机或战争时期作为前沿运作地点。
Rather than being miniature Americas, many of these bases will be operated in conjunction with or by the host nation.	许多基地都会由美国和所在国一起运营，而不仅仅是作为美国的延伸。
This will capitalize on the US military’s ability to project force around the world quickly, while providing a more flexible and politically palatable way of doing so.	这样就能够充分发挥美军向世界各地快速派遣军队的能力，同时也使这种做法更为灵活、更符合当今的政治潮流。
But, beyond the ongoing changes, major strategic questions persist.	然而，在这些进行中的变化之外，重大的战略问题依然存在。
First, how much conventional war-fighting capability should the US military retain?	首先，美军需要保持多强的常规战斗力呢？
The goal is to maintain enough to deter aggressors, but not so much that it detracts from other, more likely missions.	目标是保持足以阻止进攻者的常规战斗力，但又不至于强到拖累其它类似使命执行的程度。
Second, what will America’s relationship with its traditional allies be?	其次，美国和其传统的盟友要保持怎样的关系？
Will formal alliances such as NATO remain the centerpiece of American strategy, or will they be superseded by mission-specific coalitions?	像“北约”这样的正式联盟会依然是美国战略的核心，还是会有以具体使命为目的组成的联盟来替代它们？
Third, how much should the US continue to invest in advanced, high-tech weapons more appropriate for conventional enemies than for fighting terrorists or insurgents?	再者，相对于反恐怖和反叛乱的投入，美国还需要在应对常规敌人的先进高科技武器上多投入多少呢？
Systems such as the F/A-22 Raptor aircraft and the Army’s Future Combat System are extraordinarily expensive.	像F/A-22“猛禽”战斗机和“未来战斗系统”等装备都极为昂贵。
At a time when deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan are straining the defense budget and much of the military’s existing equipment needs repair or replacement, questions arise as to whether such programs are a good investment.	在向伊拉克和阿富汗派军使美国国防预算吃紧，且许多现役设备都需要维修和更新的时候，在这些项目上投资是否明智就是值得考量了。
Fourth, what is the appropriate size of the US military?	还有，美军的规模究竟需要多大？
Many defense intellectuals, former military leaders, and politicians believe that America’s military, particularly the ground forces, are too small to implement Bush’s grand strategy.	许多国防专家、前美军领导人和政治家都认为要实施布什的宏大计划，美军，特别是陆军的规模太小了。
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, on the other hand, believes the size of the military is adequate if it is re-organized for maximum efficiency.	但另一方面，国防部长拉姆斯菲尔德认为如果通过重组使效能最大化，那么美军现有的规模足够了。
He is also concerned that an increase in the size of the military will diminish funds available for advanced technology and systems.	他还担心扩军会使在先进技术和系统方面的投入减少。
Because Rumsfeld is the primary architect of the upcoming defense review, it is very unlikely to recommend an increase in the size of the force.	由于拉氏是即将出台的国防评估的首要负责人，所以这份评估不大可能会建议扩大军队规模。
The changes underway in American defense policy reflect planning assumptions.	美国国防政策正在发生的变化反映了一些规划性的假设。
The strategy that emerges will be only as strong as these assumptions are accurate.	这些假设的准确度将会决定该战略的有效性。
The upcoming defense review will mandate changes based on events of the past five years, focusing especially on Iraq, Afghanistan, and other aspects of the war on terror.	即将出台的国防评估将会以过去五年所发生的事件，特别是以伊拉克、阿富汗和反恐战争的其它方面为基础，要求进行改革。
The question is whether future American military missions will replicate those of the past five years.	问题是未来的美国军事使命是否会照搬过去五年以来的先例。
If not, the US might be preparing for the last war rather than the next one.	如果答案是否定的，那么美国可能就会为其最后一场而��是下一场战争做准备了。
One hopes that the 2005 Defense Review will address this issue, although it is certain to answer some strategic questions and leave others open to continued debate.	我们希望《2005国防评估》会着手解决这一问题，虽然它肯定会回答一些战略问题而将其他的留在日后商榷。
In any case, the new review will serve as a roadmap for future US defense policy, thus affecting America’s partners and adversaries alike.	无论如何，新的评估报告会成为美国未来国防政策的路线图，从而对美国的伙伴和敌人都产生影响。
	
Will the Sun Still Rise?	日本能否再次崛起？
TOKYO – The scale of the earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in March was far greater than even the authorities’ worst scenarios foresaw.	发自东京 — — 3月那场地震海啸灾难的破坏程度比日本当局的最悲观预计还要严重。
Nearly six months later, the total damage remains difficult to estimate.	虽然灾难发生至今已近6个月，但总损失却依然无从统计。
Social unrest and confusion, as well as radiation leaks from the Fukushima nuclear power plant, continue.	同时社会的动荡则与福岛核电站放射性泄露一样无法遏制，愈演愈烈。
And now the country has absorbed another huge blow: another downgrade of its bond ratings. Both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s now rate Japanese bonds at only their fourth-highest level.	如今这个国家再遭重创，穆迪和标准普尔两大国际评级机构都将日本国债评级调整到第四高的级别。
So what policies should be implemented in response to these economic blows?	那么面对接踵而来的经济冲击，日本又该采取何种政策应对呢？
Last year, Japan’s economy grew at a relatively healthy 3% annual rate, higher than in the United States or the European Union, owing mainly to the fiscal expansion undertaken after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.	得益于2008年雷曼兄弟破产后采取的扩张性财政政策，去年日本经济实现了相对健康的3%年增长率，高于美国和欧盟。
But growth in 2011 had been predicted to slow even before the earthquake.	但2011年的增长预计会比地震前更差。
Indeed, the economy shrank by 3.5% year on year in the first quarter.	事实上第一季度经济较去年同期下滑了3.5 % 。
Now, with so much fixed capital and infrastructure destroyed by the earthquake and tsunami, the economy’s productive capacity has fallen by an estimated 2% of GDP.	如今又有如此海量的固定资产和基础设施遭到地震和海啸蹂躏，使日本企业的产能萎缩，其损失相当于2%的GDP。
But that may not be a bad thing: Prior to the earthquake, Japan had a demand-supply gap of approximately 5% of GDP.	但这或许并不是件坏事：地震之前日本经济已经供大于求，而供需缺口约等于GDP的5 % 。
While reducing this gap to 3% of GDP has led to higher prices, this is exactly what Japan needs after years of persistent deflation.	对于长期持续遭遇通货紧缩的日本来说，缺口下降到3%并引发物价上升的状况真是求之不得。
Meanwhile, higher public spending on capital investment and other special procurements will boost domestic demand.	与此同时，在资本投资和其他特殊采购项目方面的高额公共支出将刺激日本内需。
The Hanshin earthquake in 1995 destroyed capital stock worth 2% of GDP.	1995年的阪神大地震毁坏了相当于当年GDP2%的相关资产。
This time, the loss is estimated at 3.4% of GDP, implying a larger increase in domestic demand if the right public policies are pursued.	而这次的损失则想当于GDP的3.4 % ， 意味着只要推行合理的公共政策，就能更大地提升国内需求。
On the downside, confidence among consumers and investors alike has taken a hit, mainly owing to fears about radiation leakages and power shortages.	而负面因素则是出于对核泄漏的恐惧以及供电不足，消费者和投资者的信心也遭受重挫。
According to the Japan Center for Economic Research, power-supply disruptions could negatively affect the Japanese economy for the next three years.	日本经济研究中心的报告认为电力短缺将影响未来三年的经济发展。
If the Tokyo metropolitan area’s power supply were to decrease by 10% this year, for example, Japan’s GDP would fall by 2%.	如果东京大都市圈内的电力供应在今年内下降10%的话，日本的GDP就将下滑2 % 。
Soon after the disaster, the government announced that reconstruction demand and higher prices would bring about relatively rapid economic recovery.	灾后日本内阁府宣称重建需求和物价上涨将带来相对较快的经济复苏。
I think this view is too optimistic, because I suspect that the government wants to finance its new expenditure with a tax hike.	但笔者认为这个观点可能过于乐观，因为政府可能会加税来填补新的支出项目。
Moreover, the extremely sharp contraction in first-quarter GDP may indicate that the disaster’s negative impact on the economy was more significant than expected.	此外今年第一季度GDP增长的极度萎缩可能意味着灾难对经济的影响要远超预期！
Indeed, the economy is expected to have shrunk by another 2.6% year on year in the second quarter, with growth set to resume only in July-September.	日本经济预计将在今年第二季度继续遭遇2.6%的同比下滑，直到7~9月才能恢复增长。
And, contrary to the government’s outlook, the start of economic recovery could be delayed until the end of this year, with medium-term annual growth reaching 1.5- 2%.	但相对于政府的预测，经济复苏的启动时间将推迟到年末，中期年增长率则会维持在1.5%到2%之间。
A key question has been the disaster’s impact on global supply chains.	而另一个问题则关于这场灾难对全球供应链的影响。
According to Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry, which surveyed firms roughly a month after the earthquake, more than 60% of production sites in affected areas had already recovered as of April 15.	据日本经济产业省在灾难爆发一个月后所进行的调查，受灾地区超过60%的生产场所已经在4月15日前恢复运作。
Almost 30% expected to recover by the summer, and the remaining 10% foresaw normal operations after the autumn.	还有30%预计将在今年夏天复工，而剩下的10%则有望在秋后恢复生产。
But the impact of even a small number of disruptions to supply chains can be highly significant, particularly for the Asia-Pacific region.	但即便是供应链的其中一个小环节受损，所造成的影响都可能极为严重 — — 分布在亚太地区的产业链尤甚。
Consider Renesas Electronics, a medium-size company, with ¥150 billion ($1.9 billion) in annual sales, which accounts for more than half of worldwide production of essential micro-computing components for automobiles.	以日本瑞萨电子为例，这个年销售额1500亿日元（约合19亿美元）的中型企业负责为汽车提供某个必不可少的微电脑部件，供应量占全球一半以上。
Partly as a result of the damage at Renesas, Toyota’s capacity-utilization rate dropped to 50% at the beginning of May.	由于该企业受灾，丰田汽车5月初的产能利用率下降了超过50 % 。
Likewise, the chemical manufacturer Kureha (¥130 billion in annual sales) has a 70% share of the global market for adhesive materials for lithium-ion batteries – a small but essential component of cell phones.	同样，Kureha这个年销售额1300亿日元的化工企业负责供应全球70%的锂电池黏性材料 — — 锂电池虽小，却是手机不可或缺的部件。
Nokia in Finland, for example, imports 12% of its cell-phone components from Japan, and thus could be indirectly affected by the disaster.	芬兰的诺基亚公司有12%的锂电池需要从日本进口，并因此受到了地震海啸灾害的间接影响。
As a result, more companies are likely to create and implement business continuity plans.	因此更多日本企业都在着手制定和实施“持续经营计划 ” 。
Indeed, “BCP” is set to become a key term in the region’s economic discourse.	事实上，这类计划将成为受灾区域经济的关键议题。
Using BCPs to determine alternative producers means that regional economies will be integrated in a new form, with companies establishing cooperative relationships even with their competitors.	利用持续经营计划来确定其他的可替代供应商意味着该区域经济将以一种新的形势重新整合，而企业甚至会和自己的竞争对手建立合作关系。
Unfortunately, Japan’s public officials appear incapable of similar flexibility.	但不幸的是，日本的官僚们却似乎缺乏类似的弹性。
The disaster confirmed the traditional view of Japan as a country that combines a dynamic private sector with an anemic public sector and central administration.	这次大灾其实证实了一个观点：日本就是一个极富活力的私人部门与死气沉沉的公共部门与中央政府的结合体。
The government’s mistakes in so-called “risk communication” regarding the Fukushima nuclear plant, and its slowness in getting necessary aid to people displaced by the disaster, have once again put the stereotype on full display.	政府在福岛核电站事故中的所谓“危机沟通”中所犯的错误以及在救助灾民时的迟钝表现都一再印证了这个老观点。
In terms of international relations, however, the disaster could improve Japan’s bilateral ties with influential countries.	但在国际关系方面，这场灾难将改善日本与周边主要国家的双边关系。
For example, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and South Korean President Lee Myung-bak met with outgoing Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan in Fukushima, near the damaged plant – helping to ease neighboring countries’ concerns about radiation leakage.	例如中国国家总理温家宝和韩国总统李明博最近都在福岛附近地区与时任日本首相菅直人进行了会晤 — — 也有助于缓解邻近各国对核泄漏的担忧。
Moreover, Japan’s relations with the US, which had suffered since the Democratic Party of Japan came to power two years ago, appear to have emerged from the disaster stronger than ever.	此外，自从两年前日本民主党上台后就步入低谷的日美关系似乎在灾后有所巩固。
Japan’s Self-Defense Forces played an important role in rescue and restoration activities, with about half of its 200,000 personnel dispatched to the damaged area.	日本自卫队在灾后拯救和修复方面扮演了重要角色，派遣了全部20万兵力中的一半进入灾区。
While this severely weakened Japan’s defenses, the US ensured East Asia’s security by deploying an aircraft carrier and cruisers, and American forces also searched for missing victims together with the JSDF.	而此举虽然严重削弱了日本的防御能力，但美国专门派遣了一艘航空母舰和巡洋舰来维护东亚安全局势，同时美军也与自卫队一道搜索灾难失踪者。
But Japan’s neighbors expect rapid reconstruction and normalization, and for that, stronger political leadership is needed.	周边邻国都希望日本能尽快实现重建和经济正常化，而这意味着我们需要一个强大的政治领导。
The earthquake and tsunami have confronted Japan with a profound crisis – but also with a rare opportunity to undertake the comprehensive reforms that the country has postponed for far too long.	地震和海啸无疑使日本遭遇了深刻危机 — — 但也提供了一个绝佳的契机，使其能够推行拖延已久的全面改革。
	
Will the US-Japan Alliance Survive?	美日同盟会继续吗？
CAMBRIDGE – Next year marks the 50th anniversary of the United States-Japan Security Treaty, a central feature of stability in East Asia for half a century.	坎布里奇 — — 明年是《美日安全条约》五十周年纪念日，半个世纪以来它一直是东亚稳定的核心特色。
But now, with the Japanese experiencing a period of domestic political uncertainty, and North Korea’s nuclear tests and missile launches increasing their anxiety, will Japan reverse its long-standing decision not to seek a national nuclear-deterrent capability?	但现在当日本国内政治前途未卜，北朝鲜的核试验和导弹发射又使他们更加焦虑的时候，日本会不会改变不寻求国家核威慑力的决策？
Is the US-Japan alliance coming to an end?	美日同盟是否正面临解体之厄？
In the early 1990’s, many Americans regarded Japan as an economic threat.	20世纪90年代初，许多美国人视日本为经济威胁。
Some people – in both countries – viewed the security alliance as a Cold War relic to be discarded.	美日两国都有人认为应当作为冷战遗物摒弃安全同盟。
These trends were reversed by the Clinton administration’s 1995 “East Asia Strategy Report.”	克林顿政府1995年的《东亚策略报告》扭转了这种趋势。
In 1996, the Clinton-Hashimoto Declaration stated that the US-Japan security alliance was the foundation for stability that would allow growing prosperity in post-Cold War East Asia.	1996年，克林顿－桥本声明提出美日安全同盟为保障后冷战时期东亚日渐繁荣起到了稳定基石的作用。
That approach has continued on a bipartisan basis in the US, and polls show that it retains broad acceptance in Japan.	这种姿态继续在美国被两大政党所接受，且民意测验显示这种观点也被日本人广泛接受。
Most close observers of the relationship agree that the US-Japan alliance is in much better shape today than 15 years ago.	美日关系的多数密切观察者认定，今天的美日同盟比15年健康得多。
Nonetheless, the alliance faces three major challenges in a new external environment.	尽管如此，同盟还是在新的外部环境中面临三大挑战。
One is North Korea, whose recent behavior has been clever and deceptive.	其一是北朝鲜，它最近的举动既聪明又有欺骗性。
The North Koreans have violated their agreements, knowing that China, the country with the greatest potential leverage, is most concerned about regime collapse in North Korea, and thus the threat of chaos on its borders.	北朝鲜违反协定，因为他们知道潜在影响力最大的中国最担心北韩政权崩溃，进而在中朝边境上造成混乱。
Japan officially endorses the objective of a non-nuclear world, but it relies on America’s extended nuclear deterrent, and wants to avoid being subject to nuclear blackmail from North Korea (or China).	日本官方赞同实现无核世界的目标，但却依赖于美国的延伸核威慑，希望避开来自北朝鲜（或中国）的核敲诈。
The Japanese fear that the credibility of American extended deterrence will be weakened if the US decreases its nuclear forces to parity with China.	日本人害怕如果美国将核力量降低到与中国对等，美国延伸威慑的可信度将会减弱。
It is a mistake, however, to believe that extended deterrence depends on parity in numbers of nuclear weapons.	但认为延伸威慑有赖于核武器数量对等是一种误解。
Rather, it depends on a combination of capability and credibility.	相反，它取决于核能力与核信用的结合。
During the Cold War, the US was able to defend Berlin because our promise to do so was made credible by the NATO alliance and the presence of American troops, whose lives would be on the line in the event of a Soviet attack.	在冷战期间，美国能够保护柏林是因为北约联盟和美军进驻使我们的承诺真实可信，如果苏联进攻，美国士兵的生命将处在危险之中。
Indeed, the best guarantee of American extended deterrence over Japan remains the presence of nearly 50,000 American troops (which Japan helps to maintain with generous host-nation support).	实际上，美国对日延伸威慑的最佳保障依然是近50，000名美军的进驻（这支部队的存在也有赖于日本慷慨的东道支持 ） 。
Credibility is also enhanced by joint projects such as the development of regional ballistic missile defense.	发展地区弹道导弹防御等联合项目也提高了同盟的可信度。
Equally important are American actions that show the high priority that the US gives to the alliance, and its guarantees not to engage in what Japan fears will be “Japan-passing” in its relations with Asia.	表明美国重视美日同盟的行动以及不像日本人担心的那样在对亚洲关系中“忽略日本”的保证也同等重要。
That is why it was so important that US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s first trip was to Asia, and her first stop in Japan.	它解释了希拉里·克林顿国务卿上任后首访亚洲、而首访亚洲时又将首站定为日本为什么如此重要。
It is also why it is mistaken to speak of a formal G-2 with China, rather than multilateral cooperation.	它还解释了探讨中美两国正式峰会，而不是多边合作为什么是错的。
A second challenge for Japan is the dramatic rise of China’s economy.	中国经济的戏剧性崛起是日本面临的第二大挑战。
Although an important trade partner, China’s growing power makes Japan nervous.	虽然是日本重要的贸易伙伴，但中国日渐强大的力量令日本感到不安。
When re-negotiating the US-Japan security alliance in the 1990’s, Japanese leaders sometimes privately asked me if the US would desert Japan in favor of China.	20世纪90年代重新谈判美日安全同盟时，日本领导人有时私下问我美国是否会抛弃日本转而与中国交好。
I responded then (and today) that there is little prospect of such a reversal, for two reasons.	我当时回答说发生这种逆转的可能性极小（现在我的回答还是一样 ） ， 原因有两个。
First, China poses a potential threat, whereas Japan does not.	第一，中国会带来潜在威胁，而日本不会。
Second, the US shares democratic values with Japan, and China is not a democracy.	第二，美日之间拥有共同的民主价值观，而中国不是民主国家。
Moreover, China’s internal evolution remains uncertain.	此外，我们也无法确定中国的内部变化。
While Chinese are more free today than at any time in their history, China’s political evolution has lagged behind its economic progress.	尽管今天的中国比历史上任何时候都更加自由，但中国的政治改革已经落后于经济发展。
Unlike India, China has not solved the problem of political participation.	和印度不同的是，参政问题在中国并没有得到解决。
There is always a residual danger that China will embrace nationalism to ward off domestic problems.	因此中国借民族主义逃避国内问题的危险永远存在着。
At the same time, it is in the interest of the US, Japan, and China that China’s rise be peaceful and harmonious (in the words of Chinese leaders).	与此同时，中国和平和谐（用中国领导人的话说）的崛起符合美、日、中三方的利益。
Treat China as an enemy, and you guarantee enmity.	把中国当成敌人注定会收获仇恨。
That is why the strategy of integration, plus a hedge against uncertainty, makes sense for both the US and Japan.	这也解释了融合策略，再加上对不确定性防范，为什么适用于美日两国。
Indeed, there are strong grounds for the US, Japan, and China to engage in areas of trilateral and other regional cooperation.	实际上，美国、日本和中国有充分的理由在三边及其他地区合作中互相配合。
Third, the US-Japan alliance will have to face a new set of transnational challenges to our vital interests, such as pandemics, terrorism, and human outflows from failed states.	第三，美日同盟将不得不面对传染病、恐怖主义和失败国家人口流出等对我们根本利益的新一轮跨国挑战。
Chief among these challenges is the threat posed by global warming, with China having surpassed the US as the leading producer of carbon-dioxide emissions (though not in per capita terms).	在这些挑战中居于首要地位的是全球变暖，中国已经超越美国成为二氧化碳第一大排放国（虽然从人均角度衡量并非如此 ） 。
Fortunately, this is an area that plays to Japan’s strengths.	幸运的是，这个领域是日本的强项。
Although some Japanese complain about the unequal nature of the alliance’s security components, owing to the limits that Japan has accepted on the use of force, in these new areas, Japan is a stronger partner.	尽管某些日本人由于日本接受了运用武力的限制条款而抱怨同盟安全条款不平等，但在这些新领域中，日本是更强有力的伙伴。
Japan’s overseas development assistance in places ranging from Africa to Afghanistan, its participation in global health projects, its support of the United Nations, its naval participation in anti-piracy operations, and its research and development on energy efficiency place it at the forefront in dealing with the new transnational challenges.	日本的海外发展援助遍及从非洲到阿富汗的各个角落，它对全球健康计划的支持、对联合国的支持、派海军参与打击海盗行动、以及它在能效方面的研发工作使其处在应对新跨国挑战的前沿。
Given today’s agenda, there is enormous potential for an equal partnership, working with others, in the provision of global public goods that will benefit the US, Japan, and the rest of the world.	在今天的大背景下，建立平等的伙伴关系、为全球公共利益相互合作从而使美、日和世界其他国家从中受益的潜力巨大。
That is why I remain optimistic about the future of the US-Japan alliance.	这也解释了我为什么对美日同盟的未来持乐观态度。
	
Can Trump’s Sanctions Break Iran?	特朗普的制裁能击垮伊朗吗？
LONDON – “The Iran sanctions have officially been cast,” tweeted US President Donald Trump three months after he signed an executive order in May announcing his administration’s withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.	伦敦 — “ 伊朗制裁已经正式开始 ， ” 美国总统特朗普在5月份签署宣布其政府退出2015年伊核协议之后三个月发推特说。
He went on to boast the return of “the most biting sanctions ever imposed,” as if sounding the death knell of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the deal is officially known.	他接着夸耀恢复了“史上最严厉制裁 ” ， 好像已经敲响了联合全面行动计划（JCPOA，伊核协议的正式名称）的警钟。
The announcement took few observers by surprise.	特朗普如此宣布并没有让观察者们意外。
But the irony was not lost on Wendy Sherman, the JCPOA’s senior US negotiator, who quipped recently that she had always expected “the greatest challenge to the deal’s success would be violations by Iran, not the political machinations of the president of the United States.”	但JCPOA的美国资深谈判员温迪·谢尔曼（Wendy Sherman）突显出其讽刺之处，她最近从这个她一直认为“取得成功最大的挑战将来自伊朗违规，而非美国总统的政治诡计”的协议中辞职。
Indeed, Iran and the US seem to have reversed roles: Iran’s isolation before the deal now contrasts with America’s determination to swim against the global tide.	事实上，伊朗和美国似乎发生了角色颠倒：协议签订前是伊朗被孤立，这与美国逆全球潮流而动形成鲜明对比。
Disappointment, if not disbelief, prevailed among the JCPOA’s other parties – the European Union countries, Russia, and China – whose leaders were quick to reaffirm their strong commitment to the agreement.	JCPOA的其他各方 — — 欧盟国家、俄罗斯和中国 — — 无不感到失望甚至信念破碎，这些国家的领导人很快就重申将强烈支持伊核协议。
By contrast, US officials have reiterated the Trump administration’s determination permanently to rein in Iran’s “nuclear ambitions,” limit its ballistic missiles program, and scale down its regional influence.	相反，美国官员重申特朗普决心要永久封杀伊朗的“核野心 ” ， 限制其弹道导弹计划，并削弱其地区影响力。
By the sanctions’ final stage, which kicks in on November 4 (coinciding, as it happens, with the 39th anniversary of the abduction of diplomats and staff at the US Embassy in Tehran in 1979), the US goal is to reduce Iran’s oil exports “down to zero.”	至于始于11月4日（恰巧正逢1979年美国驻德黑兰大使馆外交官和工作人员被绑架39周年）的制裁第一阶段，目标是将伊朗石油出口削减“到零 ” 。
Given the long and fraught history of economic sanctions against Iran, the question looming now is whether this time they are more likely to be effective in changing the regime or its behavior.	从漫长又令人心忧的伊朗经济制裁史看，现在的问题是这一次的制裁在改变伊朗体制或行为方面是否可能奏效。
The last time Iran’s oil exports were reduced to negligible levels through an extensive economic boycott was in the mid-twentieth century, when Iran’s popularly elected prime minister, Mohammad Mossadegh, nationalized the oil industry.	上一次通过全面经济抵制让伊朗石油出口下降到可忽略水平是在二十世纪中叶，当时，伊朗深孚众望的当选总理摩萨德实施了石油工业国有化。
A British-led blockade of Iran’s oil brought the industry to a virtual standstill, destabilized the economy, and paved the way for the infamous US and UK-instigated coup which restored the Shah to power in 1953.	英国发动的抵制伊朗是有运动让伊朗石油业几乎停滞，经济陷入动荡，也为美国和英国煽动臭名昭著的1953年沙复辟政变铺平了道路。
Such has been the hangover from those tumultuous years that it took a half-century for US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to acknowledge in 2000 that the coup that ousted Mossadegh was a clear “setback for Iran’s political development” and a key reason “why many Iranians continue to resent this intervention by America.”	这些骚动年代的余波让半个世纪后的美国国务卿奥尔布赖特在2000年时承认推翻摩萨德的政变显然是“伊朗政治发展的倒退 ” ， 也是“大量伊朗人憎恨美国干预”的关键原因。
Such remorse, if it can be considered that, did not, however, close the door on more sanctions against Iran.	但如此懊悔也没能阻止对伊朗采取更多制裁。
Sanctions imposed by the US and the EU from 2010 to 2015 had mixed results.	2010—2015年间美国和欧盟所施加的制裁效果喜忧参半。
These comprehensive measures – described by then-US Vice President Joe Biden as “the most crippling sanctions in the history of sanctions,” shrank oil exports by two-thirds, to below one million barrels a day.	这些全面措施 — — 时任美国副总统拜登称之为 “制裁史上最令人窒息的制裁 ” — —让伊朗石油出口量减少了三分之二，至每天一百万桶以下。
The resulting stagflation heaped misery on ordinary Iranians, with GDP contracting almost 6% in 2012 and inflation averaging 35% the following year.	由此导致的滞涨让普通伊朗老百姓不堪重负，2012年，GDP收缩了6 % ， 第二年，平均通胀达到了 35 % 。
Widespread private-sector failures and growing unemployment followed.	私人部门的大量破产和不断升高的失业接踵而至。
Contrary to the sanctions’ principal objectives, however, the economic and political hold of the public sector and parastatal organizations strengthened.	但与制裁的主要目标背道而驰的是，公共部门和准政府组织的经济和政治控制力不降反升。
Meanwhile, Iran insisted on its sovereign right to pursue a peaceful nuclear program.	与此同时，伊朗坚持发展和平核计划的主权权利。
The scope for compromise seemed absent until the reformist administration of President Hassan Rouhani took over in 2013.	直到2013年伊朗改革派总统鲁哈尼上台，才有了妥协空间。
So what is different this time?	那么，这一次有什么不同？
Though promising to be even more biting, the US sanctions regime is not backed by UN Security Council resolutions and hence lacks international legitimacy.	尽管美国的制裁号称更加严厉，但并没有联合国安理会决议的支持，因此不具有国际合法性。
This means Iran’s isolation will be far less complete, with key trading partners such as China and Turkey already announcing that they will abide by “legal” sanctions only.	这意味着伊朗并非完全孤立，中国和土耳其等重要贸易伙伴都已宣布只配合“合法的”制裁。
But the sanctions’ de facto, not de jure, status will determine their effectiveness.	但制裁的实际而非法律地位才是决定其效果的因素。
This is especially true of European firms, which will ultimately decide the outcome of the battle for secondary sanctions in cognizance of their shareholders’ interests, rather than the political machinations of their governments.	对于欧洲企业来说尤其如此，其股东的利益，而非政府的政治诡计，才是决定二级制裁（secondary sanctions）的结果的因素。
This explains the significant stream of exits from Iran’s markets already announced by large firms.	这解释了为何大量大企业宣布退出伊朗市场。
In an interconnected world where US economic influence extends far and wide, it is hard even for European firms – auto manufacturers, airlines, energy companies, banks, and the like – to risk the ire of the US Treasury.	在这个美国经济影响力大得多、广得多的联动世界，即便是欧洲企业 — — 汽车制造商、航空公司、能源公司、银行等 — — 也不敢冒险触怒美国财政部。
This means that the ultimate success of sanctions is likely to depend on what others make of them as much as on what Iran does.	这意味着制裁的最终成功不但取决于伊朗做什么，也依赖于其他国家怎么做。
But domestic conditions in Iran also play a key role, and it is here that the US seems to be basing its confidence that sanctions will “succeed.”	但伊朗的国内情况也起着重要作用，而美国认为制裁将“成功”的信心基础也在这里。
For months, Iranian cities have been rocked by widespread protests, ostensibly against worsening economic conditions.	几个月来，伊朗各大城市爆发了广泛的示威，表面上看，是因为经济情况的恶化。
These outbursts have weakened Iran’s reformers by undermining their monopoly on hope.	这些示威的爆发破坏了伊朗改革派对希望垄断，削弱了他们的地位。
Hardliners, it seems, have been offered a new lease on life and can now claim their dismissal of the JCPOA was justified from the start.	强硬派赢得喘息之机，现在，他们可以宣称他们对JCPOA的抵制从一开始就是正确的。
The economic impact has already been felt, with the Iranian currency going into freefall after speculation about a US withdrawal from the deal began.	经济影响已经能够深切感受到，自人们开始猜测美国将推出伊核协议以来，伊朗货币价值暴跌。
The specter of inflation is back.	通胀的幽灵卷土重来。
Ultimately, for sanctions to succeed from the US perspective, they must bring about either regime change or behavioral change.	最终，从美国角度要让制裁成功，必须实现政权更迭或行为改变。
Historically, sanctions have a less-than-convincing track record (think Cuba, Myanmar, and Zimbabwe) on achieving the former, and whether they can pave the way for the latter, in the form of a negotiated settlement, remains to be seen.	历史上，制裁对前者的效果十分有限（想想古巴、缅甸和津巴布韦 ） ， 至于能否为后者（以商定和解为标志）奠定基础仍有待观察。
But one thing is clear: applied to Iran, the “Trump doctrine” of pushing one’s foes to the brink, in the hope that they will blink first, has entered uncharted terrain.	但有一件事是清楚的：在伊朗身上，将敌人逼到墙角希望其就范的“特朗普主义”已经进入了未知领域。
	
Renminbi Rising?	人民币崛起？
SHANGHAI – China is increasingly debating whether or not the renminbi should be internationalized, possibly joining the US dollar and the euro as an international vehicle currency (IVC) – that is, a currency that other countries use to denominate the prices of their traded goods and international loans.	上海—在中国，一场日益激烈的争论是人民币是否应该国际化，加入美元和欧元的行列成为国际媒介货币（international vehicle currency，IVC ） ， 即其他国家用来为贸易商品和国际贷款计价的货币。
Related to this is a debate about whether Shanghai can become a first-tier international financial center (1-IFC) like London and New York.	与此有关的一场争论是上海是否能够成为顶级国际金融中心（first-tier international financial center ，1-IFC ） ， 与伦敦和纽约相抗衡。
Financial history can help to answer these questions.	金融史可以帮助回答这些问题。
First, a city can become a 1-IFC only if its national currency is an IVC.	首先，一个城市只有在所在国货币成为IVC时才可能成为1-IFC。
But, as London’s status shows, a longtime 1-IFC can retain its position in the international financial system even if its currency is no longer an IVC.	但是，正如伦敦的地位所表明的，即使所在国货币已不再是IVC，老牌1-IFC仍可以保有其在国际金融体系中的地位。
Second, the transaction cost of using a foreign currency as a medium of exchange is inversely proportional to the extent to which that currency is used globally.	其次，使用外国货币作为交易媒介的交易成本与这种货币的全球使用程度成反比。
Similar economies of scale characterize foreign investors’ use of a particular international financial center.	外国投资者使用某一特定国际金融中心具有类似的规模经济特征。
As a result, there cannot be more than three or four IVCs and 1-IFCs.	因此，IVC和1-IFC的数量不会超过三四个。
Third, a country’s financial sector must be both open, with no capital-flow restrictions, and sophisticated, with a wide range of instruments and institutions.	第三，一国的金融部门必须是开放的，没有资本管制，并且十分成熟，具备各种工具和机构。
It must also be safe, with a central bank maintaining economic stability, prudential regulators keeping fraud and speculation in check, macro-prudential authorities displaying adequate financial fire-fighting capabilities, and a legal system that is predictable, transparent, and fair.	它还必须是安全的，有一家维持经济稳定的中央银行，有监督欺诈和投机的审慎监管者，有足够的金融救火能力的宏观审慎当局，有可预测、透明、公正的司法体系。
Last – and most important – successful convergence to IVC and 1-IFC status requires the national economy to be strong relative to other economies for a substantial period of time.	IVC和1-IFC的第四个（也是最重要的一个）成功秘诀是，在相当长的一段时间里，其国民经济相对其他经济体保持优势。
The United Kingdom occupied a position of global economic leadership for more than a century.	英国占据全球经济领导地位超过一百年。
In 1914, the US/UK GDP ratio was 2.1, but the US dollar was not an IVC, suggesting that America’s relative economic strength was inadequate.	1914年，美国/英国GDP之比为2.1，但美元仍不是IVC，这表明美国的相对经济实力仍不够强大。
A decade later, in 1924, the ratio was 3.2 and rising – and the US dollar had eclipsed the British pound as the most important IVC.	十年后的1924年，美国/英国GDP之比变为3.2，并呈现继续上升之势，美元也超过英镑成为最重要的IVC。
Relative economic strength explains why the Japanese yen failed to develop into an IVC, and why Tokyo – whose financial markets satisfied the relevant requirements – failed to become a 1-IFC.	相对经济强势解释了为何日元没有发展成为IVC，以及东京 — — 其金融市场已满足相关条件 — — 没有能够成为1-IFC。
With its GDP reaching only about 60% of America’s at its peak in 1991, Japan never attained the critical mass required to induce foreigners to use the yen to lower transaction costs.	在1991年的最高峰，日本GDP只有美国的60 % ， 因此日本从未达到过促使外国人使用日元来降低交易成本的临界值。
Determining the future international status of the renminbi and Shanghai must begin with a calculation of China’s expected relative economic strength vis-à-vis the US under two plausible scenarios.	确定人民币和上海的未来国际地位必须从计算两种大概率情形下中国对美国的相对经济强度开始。
In the first scenario, China becomes caught in a middle-income trap, with per capita GDP stuck at 30% of America’s – an outcome that has characterized Latin America’s five largest economies since at least 1960, and Malaysia since 1994.	在第一种情形中，中国将陷入中等收入陷阱，人均GDP停留在美国的30 % — —拉美最大的五个经济体自1960年以来便处于这一状态，马来西亚则从1994年开始处于这一状态。
This would put China’s economic strength relative to the US at 1.1 – well below the necessary ratio.	这意味着中国对美国的相对经济强度为1.1，远远低于必要条件比率。
In the second, more favorable scenario, China’s per capita GDP would reach 80% of America’s – higher than the 70% average rate for the five largest Western European countries since 1960 – and its economic strength relative to the US would amount to roughly 2.8.	在第二种较有利的情形中，中国人均GDP将达到美国的80 % — —高于西欧最大的五个经济体自1960年以来的平均水平70 % — —其对美国的相对经济强度将达到2.8左右。
This would make the renminbi eligible for IVC status and enable Shanghai to choose whether to become a 1-IFC.	这意味着人民币有资格获得IVC地位，上海也有资格选择是否成为1-IFC。
But China’s economy still would not be strong enough relative to the US for natural market forces to ensure the renminbi’s international success.	但中国经济相对美国的强度不足以保证通过自然市场力量让人民币获得国际成功。
Given this, the Chinese government would have to implement decisive measures to encourage international traders and creditors to price their transactions in renminbi.	基于此，中国政府必须采取果断措施鼓励国际交易者和债权人用人民币为交易定价。
Specifically, China would have to use its market power to promote pricing in renminbi for relevant manufactured exports and raw-material imports, and encourage renminbi denomination of foreign financial assets that China purchases (which the country’s status as a net creditor should facilitate).	具体而言，中国必须利用其市场实力促使用人民币为相关出口制造品和原材料进口品定价，并鼓励用人民币为中国购买的外国金融资产计价（在这方面，中国的净债权人地位应能有所助益 ） 。
But there are serious pitfalls to avoid in this process.	但在此过程中需要规避诸多陷阱。
As the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 demonstrated, capital-account liberalization could lead to financial meltdowns – a danger that opponents of internationalizing the renminbi often cite.	正如1997—1998年亚洲金融危机所标明的，资本账户自由化可能导致金融崩溃 — — 这也是人民币国际化的反对者经常提到的危险。
But these risks do not outweigh the potential benefits of financial openness, and they can be minimized with effective monitoring and regulation, including requirements for large capital buffers and low leverage ratios, together with strong crisis-response mechanisms, like a resolution trust corporation.	但这些风险尚不足以胜过金融开放的潜在好处，也可以通过有效监控和监管实现最小化，包括提高资本缓冲、降低杠杆率以及成立清算信托公司等强大的危机反应机制。
In fact, effective financial-monitoring and prudential-regulation systems do not have to precede opening the capital account.	事实上，有效的金融监控和审慎管理体系并不一定要先于资本账户开放。
On the contrary, developing and enacting financial regulation must be a gradual process, shaped by both existing knowledge and firsthand experience.	相反，发展和实施金融监管必须是渐进过程，根据现有知识和第一手经验改进。
After all, no financial market is either completely open or completely closed forever; the degree of openness at a given moment depends on policy choices.	毕竟，不存在永远完全开放或封闭的金融市场，给定时刻的开放程度根据政策选择而定。
The recent establishment of the Shanghai Free Trade Zone will allow for the emergence of an offshore international financial center that offers real-world training to China’s regulators.	最近成立的上海自由贸易区将允许离岸国际金融中心的出现，中国监管者将受到真实世界的训练。
This will give them the tools they need to recognize the signs of a developing crisis, defuse the threat, and efficiently handle the recapitalization and reorganization of failed financial institutions.	这将让他们获得识别危机发展信号、扼杀风险、有效处理倒闭金融机构资本重组所需要的工具。
China’s pursuit of an IVC and a 1-IFC city would serve not only its own interests.	中国对IVC和1-IFC的追求不仅符合其自身利益。
Allowing the renminbi to help meet global demand for international reserves and risk diversification would also strengthen global financial stability.	让人民币帮助满足世界对国际储备和风险多元化的需求能加强全球金融稳定。
There is little time to waste in internationalizing the renminbi.	人民币国际化刻不容缓。
Given the limited number of currencies that can serve as IVCs, the failure of the renminbi to achieve IVC status before, say, the Indian rupee, the Russian ruble, or the Brazilian real could mean that the renminbi is denied IVC status – and that Shanghai fails to achieve 1-IFC status – for generations, if not forever.	能成为IVC的货币数量极为有限，如果人民币不能抢在印度卢比、俄罗斯卢布或巴西雷亚尔之前成为IVC将意味着在几代人的时间里（如果不是永远的话）人民币都将失去IVC地位，上海也将无法获得1-IFC地位。
	
Winners and Losers in the Post-9/11 Era	后9/11时代的赢家和输家
September 11, 2001, is one of those dates that mark a transformation in world politics.	2001年9月11日是标志世界政治转折的日子之一。
Just as the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989, signified the Cold War’s end, al-Qaeda’s attack on the United States opened a new epoch.	正如1989年11月9日柏林墙倒塌标志着冷战的结束，基地组织对美国的袭击开创了一个新的时代。
A non-governmental group killed more Americans that day than the government of Japan did with its surprise attack on another transformative date, December 7, 1941.	一个非政府组织在那天杀死的美国人比日本政府在另一个具有转折意义的日子，1941年12月7日，发动突然袭击杀害的人数还要多。
While the jihadi terrorist movement had been growing for a decade, 9/11 was the turning point.	尽管杰哈德恐怖运动10年来一直快速发展，9/11仍然是一个重要转折。
Five years into this new era, how should we characterize it?	在如今离新时代开启已满5年之际，我们又该如何定义这个时代呢？
Some believe that 9/11 ushered in a “clash of civilizations” between Islam vs. the West.	有人认为9/11导致了伊斯兰和西方之间“文明的碰撞 ” 。
Indeed, that is probably what Osama bin Laden had in mind.	没错，那也许正是奥萨马·本·拉登袭击美国的初衷。
Terrorism is a form of theater.	恐怖主义是一种戏剧化的模式。
Extremists kill innocent people in order to dramatize their message in a way that shocks and horrifies their intended audience.	恐怖分子杀害无辜群众，以此来增强其信息的戏剧化效果，惊吓和恐吓他们的目标受众。
They also rely on what Clark McCauley and others have called “jujitsu politics,” in which a smaller fighter uses the strength of the larger opponent to defeat him.	他们还必须依赖克拉克·麦考利和其他人所说的“柔道政治 ” ， 其核心是小个子斗士利用大个子对手的力量来击败他。
In that sense, bin Laden hoped that the US would be lured into a bloody war in Afghanistan, similar to the Soviet intervention two decades earlier, which had created such a fertile recruiting ground for jihadists.	在这种意义上，本·拉登期望美国会禁不住引诱，像20年前苏联一样，在阿富汗发动一场血腥的战争。 苏联那次入侵为圣战分子创造了甚为肥沃的人员招募土壤。
But the Americans used a modest amount of force to remove the Taliban government, avoided disproportionate civilian casualties, and were able to create an indigenous political framework.	但美国只派小股部队推翻了塔利班政府，避免了大规模的平民伤亡，还建立起了本土的政治框架。
While far from perfect, the first round in the fight went to the US.	尽管远远称不上完美，但美国赢得了战争的第一个回合。
Al-Qaeda lost the sanctuaries from which it planned its attacks; many of its leaders were killed or captured; and its central communications were severely disrupted.	基地组织失去了策划袭击活动的庇护所，很多高层领导人物命丧黄泉或锒铛入狱，其核心领导层的消息传递也严重受阻。
Then the Bush administration succumbed to hubris and made the colossal mistake of invading Iraq without broad international support.	接着布什政府被傲慢自大冲昏了头脑，没有赢得国际社会的普遍支持就贸然入侵伊拉克。
Iraq provided the symbols, civilian casualties, and recruiting ground that the jihadi extremists had sought in Afghanistan.	杰哈德极端分子在阿富汗未能得到的象征标志、平民伤亡和人员招募土壤，都在伊拉克战争中如愿以偿。
Iraq was George Bush’s gift to Osama bin Laden.	伊拉克是布什送给奥萨马·本·拉登的一份厚礼。
Al-Qaeda lost its central organizational capacity, but it became a symbol and focal point around which like-minded imitators could rally.	基地组织失去了核心组织能力，却成了号召思想极端的模仿者们的旗帜和焦点。
With the help of the Internet, its symbols and training materials became easily available around the world.	通过互联网络，基地组织的标志和训练材料可以在全球范围内轻易得到。
Whether al-Qaeda had a direct role in the Madrid and London bombings, or the recent plot to blow up airliners over the Atlantic, is less important than the way it has been transformed into a powerful “brand.”	无论基地组织是否直接参与了马德里和伦敦爆炸案，或者前不久在大西洋上空炸毁航班的阴谋，与它已经转型为恐怖主义最大“品牌”的事实相比都显得无关紧要。
The second round went to the extremists.	极端分子赢得了第二回合。
The outcome of future rounds in the struggle against jihadi terrorism will depend on our ability to avoid the trap of “jujitsu politics.”	反抗杰哈德恐怖主义今后斗争的结果将取决于我们能否避开“柔道政治”的重重陷阱。
That will require more use of the soft power of attraction rather than relying so heavily on hard military power, as the Bush administration has done.	这需要更多利用吸引力等软性力量，而不能像布什政府那样过多地依赖强硬的军事实力。
For the struggle is not a clash of Islam vs. the West, but a civil war within Islam between a minority of terrorists and a larger mainstream of non-violent believers.	因为这场斗争的双方不是伊斯兰和西方世界，而是伊斯兰内部矛盾，对立双方是少数恐怖分子，以及作为主流的伊斯兰非暴力信徒。
Jihadi extremism cannot be defeated unless the mainstream wins.	只有主流获胜，才能击败杰哈德极端主义。
Military force, intelligence, and international police cooperation needs to be used against hardcore terrorists affiliated with or inspired by al-Qaeda, but soft power is essential to attracting the mainstream and drying up support for the extremists.	这需要军队、情报和国际警察部门通力合作，打击基地组织下属、或在其感召下成立的强硬恐怖分子。 然而，在吸引伊斯兰主流民众、铲除对极端分子的支持方面，软性力量起着至关重要的作用。
US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld once said that the measure of success in this war is whether the number of terrorists we are killing and deterring is larger than the number that the terrorists are recruiting.	美国国防部长拉姆斯菲尔德曾经说过：这场战争胜负的衡量标准是看我们杀死和遏制的恐怖分子是否超过了他们所吸收的新鲜血液。
By this standard, we are doing badly.	按照这样的标准，我们的成绩不容乐观。
In November 2003, the official number of terrorist insurgents in Iraq was given as 5,000.	2001年，伊拉克叛乱分子的官方统计数字是5，000。
This year, it was reported to be 20,000.	今年，据称这个数字已经增加到20，000。
As Brig. General Robert Caslen, the Pentagon’s deputy director for the war on terrorism, put it, “We are not killing them faster than they are being created.”	正如五角大楼副主任罗伯特·凯斯伦准将所说的那样 ， “ 我们消灭他们的速度远远比不上他们自我复制的速度 。 ”
We are also failing in the application of soft power.	在软性力量的应用方面，我们也做得非常不够。
According to Caslen, “We in the Pentagon are behind our adversaries in the use of communication – either to recruit or train.”	凯斯伦说 ， “ 五角大楼在宣传沟通的运用上不及我们的对手¾在人员招募和训练方面都是如此 。 ”
The manner in which we use military power also affects Rumsfeld’s ratio.	我们使用军事力量的方式也影响到“拉姆斯菲尔德比 ” 。
In the aftermath of 9/11, there was a good deal of sympathy and understanding around the world for America’s military response against the Taliban.	9/11事件后，全世界都对美国对塔利班的军事打击表示理解和同情，而美国入侵与9/11袭击毫无瓜葛的伊拉克将世界人民的同情挥霍殆尽。
The US invasion of Iraq, a country that was not connected to the 9/11 attacks, squandered that good will, and the attractiveness of the US in Muslim countries like Indonesia plummeted from 75% approval in 2000 to half that level today.	美国在印度尼西亚等穆斯林国家的吸引力指数已经从2000年的74%大幅下降至上述比例的一半。
Indeed, occupying a divided nation is messy, and it is bound to produce episodes like Abu Ghraib and Haditha, which undercut America’s attractiveness not just in Iraq, but around the world.	实际上，占领一个四分五裂的国家本身就非常棘手，像阿布格莱布和哈迪塞这样的事件几乎肯定会发生，它们使美国在伊拉克、乃至全球的吸引力都大受影响。
The ability to combine hard and soft power is smart power.	硬性和软性力量的结合需要智慧。
When the Soviet Union invaded Hungary and Czechoslovakia during the Cold War, it undercut the soft power that it had enjoyed in Europe in the aftermath of World War II.	苏联在冷战期间对匈牙利和捷克斯洛伐克的侵略破坏了二战结束时它在欧洲国家中曾经有过的软性力量。
When Israel launched a lengthy bombing campaign in Lebanon last month, it created so many civilian casualties that the early criticisms of Hezbollah by Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia became untenable in Arab politics.	以色列上月在黎巴嫩的长时间轰炸造成了太多的平民伤亡，使得埃及、约旦和沙特阿拉伯从前对真主党的批判在阿拉伯政治中丧失了根基。
When terrorist excesses killed innocent Muslim civilians such as Egyptian Islamic Jihad did in 1993 or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi did in Amman in 2005, they undercut their own soft power and lost support.	如果毫无节制的恐怖分子再像伊斯兰杰哈德1993年在埃及或者扎卡维2005年在安曼那样去杀害无辜的穆斯林民众，损害的将是他们自己的软性力量，失去的是民众对他们的支持。
The most important lesson five years after 9/11 is that failure to combine hard and soft power effectively in the struggle against jihadi terrorism will lead us into the trap set by those who want a clash of civilizations.	9/11事件发生五年后最重大的教训是：如果不能在应对杰哈德恐怖主义的斗争中将硬性和软性力量有效地结合在一起，我们就会落入文化冲突论者早已设置好的陷阱。
Muslims, including Islamists, have a diversity of views, so we need to be wary of strategies that help our enemies by uniting disparate forces behind one banner.	穆斯林，包括伊斯兰教徒在内，有着多种不同的观点，因此我们必须对能够帮助我们的敌人联合各种力量的策略保持警惕。
We have a just cause and many potential allies, but our failure to combine hard and soft power into a smart strategy could be fatal.	我们拥有正义的事业和很多潜在的盟友，但如果不能将硬性和软性力量结合成明智的策略，将可能给我们带来致命的打击。
	
The Middle East’s Lost Decade	中东失去的十年
BERLIN – The United States has waged three wars since Al Qaeda’s terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001: against Al Qaeda, in Afghanistan, and in Iraq.	柏林 — — 2001年9月11日的“基地”组织恐怖袭击后美国已发动对“基地”组织、阿富汗和伊拉克的三次战争。
The first two were forced upon the US, but the third was the result of a willful, deliberate decision by former President George W. Bush, taken on ideological grounds and, most likely, for personal reasons as well.	前两次美国是因为迫不得已，但第三次则是前总统乔治·W·布什出于意识形态、极可能还有个人理由做出的故意决定。
Had Bush, former Vice President Dick Cheney, former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and their neocon allies been forthright about their intentions – to bring down Saddam Hussein by means of war, thereby creating a new, pro-Western Middle East – they never would have received the support of Congress and the American public.	假使布什、前副总统迪克·切尼、国防部长唐纳德·拉姆斯菲尔德及其新保守派盟友将借助战争手段推翻萨达姆·侯赛因并建设亲西方新中东的真正意图公之于众，他们永远也得不到美国国会和公众的支持。
Their vision was both naive and reckless.	他们的理想鲁莽而且非常幼稚。
So a threat – Iraqi weapons of mass destruction – had to be created.	因此必须捏造出来自伊拉克的大规模杀伤性武器威胁。
As we now know, the threat was based on lies (aluminum tubes for a nuclear-weapons program, for example, meetings between the 9/11 plot leader, Mohamed Atta, and Iraqi officials in Prague, and even glaring forgeries like supposed Iraqi orders for yellowcake uranium from Niger).	我们现在知道这种威胁纯属谎言（核武器计划的铝管、9/11阴谋领导者穆罕默德·阿塔跟伊拉克官员在布拉格会面、甚至令人发指地伪造出所谓伊拉克从尼日尔订购铀“黄饼”的订单 ） 。
Such were the justifications for a war that was to claim the lives of almost 5,000 US soldiers and more than 100,000 Iraqis.	这就是发动夺去近5,000名美军士兵和100,000多伊拉克人生命的战争的理由。
Add to that the millions more who were injured and displaced from their homes, as well as the destruction of one of the world’s oldest Christian communities.	这场战争还造成数百万人受伤和流离失所，并对世界最古老的基督教群体造成了毁灭性的破坏。
For this, the US alone spent up to $3 trillion.	仅美国在伊战中的花费就高达3万亿美元。
Bush’s war against Saddam did radically change the Middle East, though not as he envisaged.	布什对萨达姆的战争的确从根本上改变了中东局势，尽管这种改变完全出乎他自己的预料。
For starters, if the US had set out to destabilize Iraq, its efforts could hardly have been more successful: ten years later, the country’s viability as a single state has never been in greater doubt.	首先，如果美国的初衷是破坏伊拉克稳定，那恐怕这一目标已经完美实现：10年后，伊拉克能否作为统一国家存在都充满了变数。
With Saddam gone, Iraq’s Shia majority assumed power after a horrendous civil war, leaving Iraq’s defeated Sunnis longing for revenge and waiting for an opportunity to regain their ascendancy.	萨达姆被推翻后，伊拉克的什叶多数派在恐怖内战后上台，而被打败的逊尼派则渴望报复、等待夺回优势的机会。
The Kurds in the north cleverly and adeptly used the window of opportunity that opened before them to seize de facto independence, though the key question of control over the northern city of Kirkuk remains a ticking time bomb.	北方的库尔德人巧妙地利用这次机会实现了事实上的独立，尽管北部城市基尔库克关键的控制问题依然是一枚定时炸弹。
And all are fighting for as large a share of Iraq’s enormous oil and gas reserves as they can get.	所有人都竭尽全力争夺伊拉克庞大的石油和天然气资源。
Taking stock of “Operation Iraqi Freedom” a decade later, the Financial Times concluded that the US won the war, Iran won the peace, and Turkey won the contracts.	英国《金融时报》十年后盘点“伊拉克自由行动 ” ， 认为美国赢得了战争、伊朗赢得了和平而土耳其赢得了合同。
I can only agree.	我只能表示同意。
In political terms, Iran is the big winner of Bush’s war.	伊朗是布什战争在政治意义上最大的赢家。
Its number-one enemy, Saddam, was dispatched by its number-two enemy, the United States, which presented Iran with a golden opportunity to extend its influence beyond its western border for the first time since 1746.	其头号敌人萨达姆被二号敌人美国推翻，伊朗也由此看到了1746年以来首次将影响力扩大到西部边境以外的黄金机会。
Bush’s war, with its poor strategic vision and worse planning, increased Iran’s regional standing in a way that the country was unlikely ever to have achieved on its own.	布什的战争因其蹩脚的战略眼光和糟糕的计划从某种意义上提升了伊朗的区域地位，这种提升伊朗靠自己的力量永远不可能做到。
The war enabled Iran to assert itself as the dominant power in the Gulf and the wider region, and its nuclear program serves precisely these ambitions.	战争使伊朗成为海湾及更大范围内的主导力量，而核计划恰恰满足了伊朗在这方面的野心。
The losers in the region are also clear: Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states, which feel existentially threatened, and have come to regard their own Shia minorities as an Iranian fifth column.	中东地区的输家也非常明确：感觉生存受到威胁、开始将国内什叶派���数族裔视为伊朗第五纵队的沙特阿拉伯和其他海湾国家。
They have a point: with the Shia in power in Iraq, Iran will seek suitable opportunities to use local Shia populations as proxies to assert its hegemonic claims.	他们其实有一定道理：由于什叶派在伊拉克掌权，伊朗会寻找适当时机利用当地什叶派人口代理维护其霸权要求。
This is what is fueling Bahrain’s domestic turmoil, beyond the Shia majority’s local grievances.	这是除什叶多数派对当地的不满之外激起巴林国内动乱的理由。
Leaving aside the lies, fictions, and questions of morality and personal responsibility, the critical mistake of America’s war against Iraq was the absence of either a viable plan or the necessary strength to enforce a Pax Americana in the Middle East.	除去谎言、虚构、道德问题和个人责任等因素，美国对伊战争最致命的失误是缺乏可行计划及必要势力在中东贯彻美国治下的和平。
America was powerful enough to destabilize the existing regional order, but not powerful enough to establish a new one.	美国的强大足以摧毁原有的地区秩序，但却不足以建立新的秩序。
The US neocons, with their wishful thinking, grossly underestimated the scale of the task at hand – unlike the revolutionaries in Iran, who quickly moved in to reap what the US had sowed.	一厢情愿的美国新保守主义者严重低估了这项任务的难度 — — 而伊朗革命党人却恰恰相反，他们迅速行动夺走了美国种下的果实。
The Iraq war also marked the beginning of America’s subsequent relative decline.	伊拉克战争也成为美国相对衰落开始的标志。
Bush squandered a large part of America’s military strength in Mesopotamia for an ideological fiction – strength that is sorely missed in the region ten years later.	布什在美索不达米亚的意识形态谎言中浪费了美国很大一部分军力 — — 十年后这些军力在该地区还根本无法补充。
And there is no alternative to be seen without America.	美国的力量仍然无法代替。
While there is no causal link between the Iraq war and the Arab revolutions that began in December 2010, their implications have combined in a malign manner.	尽管伊拉克战争和2010年12月开始的阿拉伯革命间不存在因果关系，但两者的影响已经以恶性的方式互相结合。
Since the war, the bitter enmities between Al Qaeda and other Salafist and Sunni Arab nationalist groups have given way to cooperation or even mergers.	战后“基地”组织和其他萨拉菲斯特和逊尼派阿拉伯民族主义团体间苦涩的仇恨已经被合作、甚至兼并所取代。
This, too, is a result brought about by the American neocon masterminds.	这同样是美国新保守主义操纵者所带来的苦果。
And the regional destabilization triggered by the Arab revolutions is increasingly converging on Iraq, mainly via Syria and Iran.	由阿拉伯革命引发的地区动荡通过叙利亚和伊朗越来越集中到伊拉克。
Indeed, the gravest current danger to the region is a process of national disintegration emanating from the Syrian civil war, which is threatening to spread not only to Iraq, but also to Lebanon and Jordan.	事实上，地区目前最严重的威胁是叙利亚内战导致的国家解体，它不仅有可能威胁到伊拉克，也有可能威胁到黎巴嫩和约旦。
What makes Syria’s civil war so dangerous is that the players on the ground are no longer its driving forces.	令叙利亚内战如此危险的是其实际参与者已不再是战争的驱动力量。
Rather, the war has become a struggle for regional dominance between Iran on one side and Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey on the other.	相反，这场战争已经演变为伊朗和沙特阿拉伯、卡塔尔和土耳其之间对地区霸权的争夺。
As a result, the Middle East is at risk of becoming the Balkans of the twenty-first century – a decline into regional chaos that began with, and was largely the result of, the US-led invasion ten years ago.	中东也因此有可能沦为二十一世纪的巴尔干 — — 陷入到十年前以美国为首侵略所造成的区域动荡之中。
	
Winning the Confidence Game	信心是胜利的根本
NEW HAVEN – On April 2, the G-20 will hold a summit in London to discuss what we may hope will be an internationally coordinated plan to address the world economic crisis.	纽海文 — — 4月2日，20国集团将在伦敦举行峰会，会议的主题是，为了应对目前面临的经济危机，如何建立一个国际间相互合作协调的方案。 这正是我们目前所关心的问题。
But can such a plan really work?	难道这方案真的会管用么？
The basic problem, of course, is confidence.	当然，问题的关键还是信心问题。
People everywhere, consumers and investors alike, are canceling spending plans, because the world economy seems very risky right now. The same thing happened during the Great Depression of the 1930’s.	面临着波及全球范围的经济危机，世界各地的人们，不管是消费着还是投资者，都在削减开支，就象1930年代的大萧条那样。
A contemporary observer, Winthrop Case, explained it all in 1938: economic revival depended “on the willingness of individual and corporate buyers to make purchases that necessarily tie up their resources for a considerable length of time.	当时的亲历者温思罗普·凯斯在1938年这样写到：经济的复苏靠的是“企业和个人愿意投资和消费，而且需要持续相当长的一段时间。
For the individual, this implies confidence in the job, and in the end comes equally back to the confidence of industry leaders.”	对个人来说，就是要对自己的工作有信心，对企业来说，就是老板对所从事的行业有信心 。 ”
Unfortunately, confidence did not return until World War II ended the depression.	不幸的是，直到第二次世界大战结束，信心才开始恢复，萧条真正得以结束。
If the leaders meeting in London are to succeed where governments failed in the 1930’s, they must commit themselves to a fiscal target that is sufficient to restore full employment under normal credit conditions.	伦敦参会的领袖们必须有一个清晰的财政目标，那就是保证充分的就业和信贷市场的正常化；同时，保证借贷市场的正常化也很重要。
They must also commit themselves to a credit target that will restore lending to normal.	人们只有在有了工作，有了借贷信用的时候，才会正常的消费。
People will not spend normally unless they have both a job and normal access to credit.	这样才不会重导大萧条时代的覆辙。
During the Great Depression, such targets were not used on a large enough scale, merely fueling public despair that stimulus policies would ever work.	仅仅依靠财政刺激方案是不可能获得成功的。
The G-20 Summit should also be an occasion for affirming some basic principles.	20国峰会同样要重申一些基本的准则。 信心不是靠消费和借贷才能恢复的。
Confidence isn’t built up on the basis of spending or lending alone.	人们要了解金钱不仅仅是由政府经济刺激方案来提供，而是要有一个稳定的来源。
People need to believe that the money represents something more lasting than stimulus measures, which may eventually end in failure.	如果只依靠政府的经济救助方案，最终不能达到恢复经济的目的。
After all, the Great Depression did not end simply because of the massive stimulus of war-related expenditures.	毕竟，大萧条时代的结束并不是仅仅因为战争导致的大量支出。
Why should World War II have produced any confidence in the future?	然后，为什么二战后大家会有信心呢？
To be sure, World War II reduced the unemployment rate in the United States dramatically, from 15% in 1940 to 1% in 1944, and had a similar effect in other countries.	应该看到，二战显著地减少了失业率。 例如，美国失业率从1940年的15%下降到1944年的1 % 。
But this was not because of a revival in business confidence.	其他国家也有类似的现象。
It was because of a nasty war, plain and simple, with people drafted into fighting, or into industries supplying the war effort.	失业率减少的原因很简单，当然不是由于商业信心恢复，而是那场该死的战争本身：大量的人员或是被直接卷入战争，或是为战争相关产业服务。
The real recovery of confidence did not occur until after World War II, when the world did not sink back into depression.	市场信心的真正恢复是发生在二战之后。 当时的世界并没有重新回到经济萧条之中。
The US Council of Economic Advisors warned of this possibility in 1949, and it was not alone.	而在1949年，美国国家经济委员曾认为世界经济会重新回到萧条之中。 这当然不是偶然的。
There appears to be more than one reason why, on the contrary, confidence came roaring back.	信心恢复的原因比较复杂。
First, there was a general perception of “pent-up demand.”	首先是因为“被压抑的需求”的爆发。
After years of privation (and in many countries the physical destruction of war), people just wanted to live normally – to rebuild, own a home, a car, and other consumer goods.	由于战争而导致的多年物质极度匮乏，因此，人们想要过一种正常的生活，战后的废墟需也要重新建立 — — 重建自己的家园，拥有自己的车和其他生活用品。
The widespread impression that there was such pent-up demand also led people to believe that there could not be another depression.	基于由于以上的共同认识，人们普遍认为不会再会有另一次经济萧条。
The perception of pent-up demand was like a powerful economic stimulus package, and it had the advantage that people believed it would be long-lasting.	如此强大的需求就如同经济刺激方案，特别是大家都认为这会是一种长久的需求。
Indeed, the same long-term confidence triggered the post-war “baby boom.”	同样的信心也导致了战后“婴儿潮”的出现。
According to some contemporary observers, however, “pent-up demand” was only part of the story.	对当时的一些观察者来看 ， “ 被压抑的需求”只是经济复苏的原因之一。
During the brief but deep recession of 1949, the financial commentator Silvia Porter reflected on the attitudes that led to the 1929 crash: “We saw nothing wrong – in fact, we saw everything right – with the wild speculative boom and credit inflation that…culminated in the now almost unbelievable gambling orgy of 1929.”	1949年出现了短暂的经济萧条，在回顾1929年大萧条��期人们的表现时，当时的金融评论家塞尔威·波特说道 ： “ 那时候投机盛行，信贷膨胀，我们当时觉得一切都很正常，大家都沉浸在一时的狂欢盛宴之中，没有人意识到危险的到来 。 ”
But now, Porter wrote, after the depression and war, “We began to listen to the idea that a hundred million citizens, acting through a central government, could achieve much more than a hundred million acting as separate selfish units.	但现在，波特写到 ： “ 现在，我们一亿公民的心声通过一个中央政府来集中体现，这比我们各自为政而产生的效果要好的多。
We developed, in short, a new attitude toward the responsibilities of government.”	因此，我们需要对政府职责重新认识了 。 ”
She concluded that the positive effect of “pent-up demand” and government measures can “make sense only when viewed against the background of our changed economic and political philosophy.”	只有在我们的 社会政治观念发生改变之后，她对“压抑的需求”和“政府职责”的积极方面才能体现出来。
The Marshall Plan, which operated from 1947 to 1951, became a symbol of this new attitude.	1947—1945年的马歇尔计划正是这样改变的标志。
The US gave billions of dollars of aid to rebuild war-ravaged countries in Europe.	美国拿出数十亿美元重建战后的欧洲。
The plan was widely viewed as reflecting a new kind of enlightenment, a recognition of the importance of supporting people who needed help.	此举显示出一种全新的理念，那就是关注那些需要救助的人们。
Europe would not be allowed to languish, and the stimulus came from abroad.	为了防止欧洲的衰败，救助的力量必须来自欧洲大陆之外。
After the war, Keynesian economic theory, which was generally not accepted or understood during the Great Depression, became the basis of a new social compact. It was a theory that was perfectly suited to a generation that had just endured exceptional sacrifices, for it reaffirmed a belief in our responsibility for each other.	大萧条时代不能接受凯恩斯主义的经济理论，而在二战后以后，凯恩斯主义开始流行起来，经过二战之后，大家都已经付出了超出寻常的牺牲，为了战后的重建，大家仍然需要同舟共济，共同面对问题。
The effect of economic stimulus is redoubled by this kind of inspirational belief.	有了这种共识，再加上政府的经济刺激方案，所达到的效果就事半功倍了。
That is why all of the commitments made and intentions expressed at the upcoming G-20 summit matter.	以上所阐述的就是20国领导峰会所要达到的目标。
The countries represented must show a generous spirit and make the world economy work for all people.	参加的国家代表必须有着宽阔的胸襟，目的是为了整个人类的经济而努力。
Seemingly peripheral issues, like aid to the developing world and the poor, who suffer the most from a crisis like this one, will be part of the primary story of the renewal of confidence, just as the Marshall Plan was part of that story after World War II.	就如同救助那些发展中国家和贫穷人口的那些方案那样，对于那些深陷经济危机的国家来说，重新建立信心是一个最重要的基础，这也就是“马歇尔计划”在二战后所发挥的作用。
	
Winning the European Confidence Game	夺取欧洲信心战的胜利
CHICAGO – If any solution to the European crisis proposed over the next few days is to restore confidence to the sovereign-bond markets, it will have to be both economically viable and politically palatable to rescuers and rescued alike.	芝加哥 — — 如果未来几天内出台的欧洲危机解决方案想要重塑人们对主权债券的信心的话，那么该计划就必须在经济上可行，而且在政治上可以让救援者和被救援者双方接受。
This means paying attention not just to the plan’s technical details, but also to appearances.	这意味着我们不仅要关注解决方案的技术细节，也要注意它的包装。
There is growing consensus about any solution’s key elements.	对于解决方案的关键点，人们越来越有了共识。
First, Italy and Spain will have to come up with credible medium-term plans that will not just restore their fiscal health, but also improve their ability to grow their way out of trouble.	首先，意大利和西班牙必须给出可信的中期计划，不仅要重塑财政健康，还必须改善它们走出困境的能力。
While any plan will involve pain for citizens, the markets must deem the pain politically tolerable, at least relative to the alternatives.	不管是什么计划，公民肯定会经受一些痛苦，与此同时，市场必须认为这些痛苦在政治上是可接受的，至少要比替代方案好。
It is important that these plans be seen as domestically devised (though voters will have no illusions about the external and market pressures that have forced their governments to act).	有一点很重要：这些计划应该被视为是由本国设计的（尽管选民们会对迫使本国政府采取行动的外部和市场压力心知肚明 ） 。
At the same time, an external agency such as the International Monetary Fund could render the plan more credible by evaluating it for consistency with the country’s goals and monitoring its implementation.	与此同时，外部机构，比如IMF，可以通过评估计划与该国目标的一致性以及监督计划的实施来加强计划的可信度。
Second, some vehicle – the IMF or the European Financial Stability Facility, with either entity funded directly by countries or the European Central Bank – has to stand ready to fund borrowing by Italy, Spain, and any other potentially distressed countries over the next year or two.	其次，在未来一两年中，某些机构 — — IMF或欧洲金融稳定基金（由欧洲各国直接提供资金或由欧洲央行提供资金的实体 ） — —必须时刻准备着为意大利、西班牙和其他具有潜在风险的国家提供贷款融资。
But there is an important caveat, which has largely been ignored in public discussions: if this funding is senior to private debt (as IMF funding typically is), it will be harder for these countries to regain access to markets.	但这里有一个在公众讨论中往往被忽视的重要警告：如果该融资比私人债务级别高（IMF融资通常如此 ） ， 那么这些国家重回资本市场将难上加难。
After all, the more a country borrows in the short term from official sources, the further back in line it pushes private creditors.	毕竟，一国从官方渠道借入的短期融资越多，私人债权的比重就越低。
That makes private lenders susceptible to larger haircuts if the country eventually defaults – and thus more hesitant to lend in the first place.	这使得私人贷款人会怀疑如果该国最终违约，则其损失会更大，从而在一开始就对贷款犹豫不决。
In other words, private markets need to be convinced both that there is a low probability of default (hence the importance of credible plans), and that there is some additional loss-bearing capacity in the new funding, so that, if there is a default, outstanding or rolled-over private debt does not have to bear the full brunt.	换句话说，你必须让私人市场相信，你的违约概率很低（因此可信计划非常重要 ） ， 且新融资会有增加的损失吸收能力，万一违约发生，未偿还或展期的私人债务不会受到完全的损失。
This may seem unfair.	这可能有些不公平。
Why should the taxpayer accept a loss when they are bailing out the private sector by providing new funding?	为什么纳税人要在他们通过提供新融资拯救私人部门的同时接受损失？
In an ideal world, distressed countries would default as soon as private markets stopped funding them, and they would impose the losses on private bondholders.	理想的情况是，受困国将在私人市场停止提供融资时立刻违约，损失将由私人债权人承担。
In the real world, however, if Italy and Spain are viewed as being solvent, or too big to fail, official funding should be structured so that it gives these countries their best chance to regain market confidence.	但是，在现实世界中如果意大利和西班牙被认定破了产（或太大而不能倒 ） ， 就必须组织官方融资，以便这些国家能尽可能地赢回市场信心。
This does not mean that official funding should be junior to private debt in any restructuring, for that would require substantially more loss-bearing capacity from the official sector – capacity that is probably not available.	这并不意味着官方融资应该在重组中获得比私人债务更低的地位，因为将要求官方部门拥有极大的损失吸收能力，而这有可能是不现实的。
Indeed, if official funding were junior, it would be providing a larger cushion to private creditors – and thus bailing them out to an even greater extent.	事实上，如果官方融资地位较低，那么它相当于在为私人债权人提供更大的损失缓冲垫，从而更多地拯救私人债权人。
The simplest solution is to treat official funding no differently from private debt – best achieved if official lenders buy sovereign bonds as they are issued (possibly at a predetermined yield) and agree to be treated on par with private creditors in a restructuring.	最简单的解决办法是对官方融资和私人债务一视同仁，最佳实现方式便是在发行主权债券时由官方贷款人购买（可以固定收益率 ） ， 官方贷款人同意在重组中与私人债权人具有同等地位。
As the country regains market confidence, the official funding can be reduced, and eventually the bonds can be sold back to the markets.	当该国重新赢得市场信心时，官方融资可以削减，其买入的债券最终可以卖回给市场。
The bottom line is that official funding must be accompanied by loss-bearing capacity.	要点是官方融资必须具有损失吸收能力。
If the funding is channeled through the IMF, and is to be treated on par with private debt, the Fund will need a guarantee from the EFSF or strong eurozone countries that it will be indemnified in any restructuring.	如果官方融资走IMF渠道并与私人债务一视同仁，那么IMF需要EFSF或欧元区坚挺国家的担保，它可以在重组中获得保护。
Of course, the IMF’s member states might be willing to accept some burden sharing if a sufficient buffer provided by the eurozone were eroded, but that cannot be taken for granted.	当然，如果欧元区所提供的充分缓冲遭到破坏的话，IMF成员国可能也会愿意接受一定责任共担，但不能把这一点视为理所当然。
Once the first two elements of the plan are in place, there should be little need for the third – bond purchases by the ECB in the secondary market in order to narrow interest-rate spreads and provide further confidence.	当解决方案的前两大要素具备后，第三大要素 — — 欧洲央行在二级市场购买债券以缩小利差并提供更多的信心 — — 是否具备已经无关紧要了。
Indeed, if the ECB intends to claim preferred-creditor status for any bonds that it buys, it is probably best that it buy very few.	事实上，如果欧洲央行欲使其所买入的债券拥有优先债权地位，那么它最好不要大量买入。
Of course, the ECB will have to continue to provide support to banks until confidence about their holdings returns.	当然，欧洲央行将不得不继续向银行提供支持，直到市场对它们所持有的债券恢复信心。
But there is one more element that is needed to assure markets that the solution is politically viable.	但要让市场相信解决办法在政治上可行，还需要另一大要素。
Citizens across Europe, whether in rescued countries or rescuing countries, will be paying for years to clean up a mess for which they were not responsible.	欧洲各国公民，不管是救援国还是被救援国，将在多年内为清理并非由他们引起的乱象买单。
Not all banks voluntarily loaded up on distressed government bonds – some were pressured by supervisors, others by governments – but many have made unwise bets.	并非所有的银行都是自愿买入受困国政府债券的 — — 一些是迫于监管者压力，一些是迫于政府要求 — — 但确实有很多银行做出了不明智的投资决策。
If they are seen as profiting unduly from the rescue, even as they return to their bad old ways of paying for non-performance, they will undermine political support for the rescue – and perhaps even for capitalism.	如果它们被认为从救援行动中不正当地得利了，那么就算它们回到为不良贷款买单的错误老路上去，也会破坏对救援行动 — — 乃至资本主义 — — 政治支持。
So a final element of the package ought to be a monitored pledge by eurozone banks that they will not unload bonds as the official sector steps in; that they will raise capital over time instead of continuing to deleverage (if this hurts bank equity holders, they should think of this as burden sharing); and that they will be circumspect about banker bonuses until economies start growing strongly again.	因此，解决方案的最后一大要素应该是欧元区银行作出受监控的承诺，它们不会在官方部门介入是卸去手上持有的债券；它们将不断筹集资���，而不是不断去杠杆化（如果银行股东因此受害，那么他们应该把这想象为责任共担机制 ） ； 它们必须谨慎发放奖金，直到经济再次开始强劲增长。
Cries that this is not capitalism should be met with a firm retort: “Nor are bailouts!”	对于那些“这不是资本主义”的嚷嚷，我们可以大声地回应 ： “ 救援也不是 ！ ”
	
Winning the Peace	实现和平
Afghanistan’s future hangs in the balance as its weak national government struggles to maintain support and legitimacy in the face of a widening insurgency, warlords, the heroin trade, and a disappointed populace.	在叛乱规模越来越大、军阀越来越多、海洛因贸易猖獗、人民大失所望的情况下，阿富汗虚弱的国民政府拼命想要维持自身的合法性和民众的支持，阿富汗国内局势摇摇欲坠。
Across an arc extending from Afghanistan to East Africa, violence now also surges in Iraq, Lebanon, Somalia, and beyond, to Sudan’s Darfur region.	从阿富汗到东非一线，战火在伊拉克、黎巴嫩、索马里甚至苏丹的达尔富尔地区肆虐燃烧。
Everywhere, politicians, generals, and even diplomats talk of military strategies and maneuvers, but everywhere something utterly different is needed.	政治家、将军甚至外交家有关军事策略和调动的谈论声不绝于耳，但真正符合这些地区需要的政策却截然不同。
Stability will come only when economic opportunities exist, when a bulging generation of young men can find jobs and support families, rather than seeking their fortune in violence.	只有经济机会才能催生稳定，当越来越多的年轻人能找到工作、养家糊口，而不是靠暴力斗争来改变命运时，才能实现真正的稳定。
We are seeing again and again that a foreign army, whether NATO’s in Afghanistan, America’s in Iraq, Israel’s in occupied Palestine, or Ethiopia’s in Somalia, may win a battle, or even a war, but never the peace.	我们一再看到无论是阿富汗的北约部队、伊拉克的美国驻军、巴勒斯坦的以色列占领者还是索马里的埃塞俄比亚人，所有这些外国军队能够打胜一场战役，甚至赢得整个战争，但却永远无法实现和平。
Peace is about dignity and hope for the future.	和平是尊严，是未来的希望。
Military occupation saps dignity, and grinding poverty and economic disarray sap hope.	军事占领一点一点地消磨人的尊严、折磨人的贫穷和经济混乱慢慢使希望丧失殆尽。
Peace can be achieved only with a withdrawal of foreign troops, and the arrival of jobs, productive farms and factories, tourism, health care, and schools.	只有撤出外国军队、创造工作机会、建设高效率的农场、企业、发展旅游、医疗和教育，才能最终实现和平。
Without these, military victory and occupation quickly turn to ashes.	如果没有这些，军事胜利和占领的喜悦很快就会灰飞烟灭。
The United States government has proven itself blind to these facts, but the international community also remains ill equipped to assist in the restoration of peace following conflicts in impoverished countries.	事实证明美国政府对这一切视而不见，而国际社会也依然对战后贫困国家重建和平束手无策。
Repeatedly, a fragile peace has broken down because of the lack of economic follow-up.	因为没有后续的经济发展，脆弱的和平一而再、再而三地遭到破坏。
Despite grand promises of foreign aid, economic reconstruction, and development in Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, and elsewhere, the actual record of international assistance to post-war reconstruction is gravely deficient.	尽管阿富汗、伊拉克、黎巴嫩等地无一例外地得到了国外援助、经济重建和发展的慷慨承诺，但真正用于战后重建的国际援助却少得可怜。
The scenario has become painfully familiar. A war ends.	情况令人心痛地相似。
An international donors’ conference is called. Pledges of billions of dollars are announced.	战争结束后召集国际捐助大会，会上承诺捐赠成百上千亿美元。
A smiling new head of state graciously thanks the international community, including the occupying power.	面带笑容的新国家元首礼貌地向包括占领国在内的国际社会致谢。
Months pass. World Bank teams from Washington start to arrive.	数月以后，来自华盛顿的世界银行特派小组陆续抵达。
But actual reconstruction and recovery is delayed, perhaps for years.	但真正的重建或恢复工作却一拖再拖，也许长达数年之久。
Crony businesses from the US and Europe, which are utterly unfamiliar with local conditions, squander time, aid funds, and opportunities.	来自美国和欧洲的企业任人唯亲，完全不了解当地的情况，将时间、援助款项和机会浪费殆尽。
Two or three years pass.	两三年过去了。
The grand pronouncements become a pile of out-of-date World Bank studies.	义正词严的声明变成了一堆过时的世界银行调研报告。
Recriminations fly, the occupying army remains, and a new insurgency spreads.	到处能够听到相互指责，占领军还在耀武扬威，新一轮的叛乱又蔓延开去。
Many factors contribute to this disarray, beginning with the shocking inability of the US, Europe, and the international organizations to understand things from the perspective of poor and displaced people.	造成这种混乱的原因非常复杂，但归根结底，美国、欧洲和国际机构根本不愿为流离失所的穷人考虑是一切混乱的源泉。
Their lack of empathy is deplorable, but there are conceptual problems as well.	他们不会换位思考令人可悲可叹，但与理念有关的问题也急待解决。
The international agencies involved in post-conflict reconstruction have so far failed to understand how to start or restart economic development in a low-income setting.	参与战后重建的国际机构到目前为止还没有学会如何在低收入环境中启动经济的发展。
It’s important to distinguish four distinct phases of outside help to end a conflict.	找出外来援助结束冲突的四个步骤至关重要。
In the first phase, during the war itself, aid is for humanitarian relief, focusing on food, water, emergency medicine, and refugee camps.	在第一阶段，也就是战争阶段，援助是为了人道主义目的，重点放在食物、水、急救药品和收容帐篷。
In the second phase, at the war’s end, aid remains mainly humanitarian relief, but now directed towards displaced people returning home, and to decommissioned soldiers.	到了第二阶段，也就是战争结束阶段，援助仍然以人道主义目的为主，但现在要侧重于流离失所的百姓和退伍军人重返家园。
In the third phase, lasting three to five years, aid supports the first phase of post-war economic development, including restoration of schools, clinics, farms, factories, and ports.	第三阶段一般会持续3到5年，援助的任务是启动首阶段的战后经济发展，包括重建学校、诊所、农场、企业和港口。
In the fourth phase, which can last a generation or more, assistance is directed to long-term investments and the strengthening of institutions such as courts.	而第四阶段则需要整整一代人或更长时间的努力，重点更多地放在长期投资，以及加强以法院为首的机构建设。
The international community, and the US in particular, is dreadful at the third stage.	国际社会，特别是美国，在第三阶段的表现简直糟糕透顶。
Once a conflict is over, aid agencies seem paralyzed.	一旦战争结束，援助机构似乎就变得束手无策。
Instead of sending help, they send study groups.	他们送去的不是援助，而是派去调研小组。
There is often a lag of years before moving from humanitarian relief to real economic development.	通常从人道主义援助到真正的经济建设需要花去几年的时间。
By the time such help actually arrives, it is often too late: war has been re-ignited.	等援助真正到位的时候常常已经太迟了：战火已经被再次点燃。
In fact, it is possible to restart economic development through targeted “quick-impact” initiatives.	实际上，通过目标明确的“快速起效”方案来迅速启动经济是完全可能的。
Since the economies of most impoverished post-conflict countries are based on agriculture, restarting farm output is vital.	因为多数贫困战后国家的经济主要依赖农业，恢复农业生产是至关重要的。
Impoverished farmers should receive a free package of seeds, fertilizers, and low-cost equipment (such as pumps for irrigation).	应该向贫困农民免费发放种子、化肥和低成本的器械（比如灌溉用的水泵 ） 。
When such aid is made available quickly, former soldiers will return to their farms, and can establish a livelihood by the beginning of the first growing season following the end of hostilities.	一旦这些援助迅��到位，从前的士兵就会返回到自己的故里，并在敌对状态结束后通过种植第一季庄稼开始新的生活。
This type of aid does not require long studies, but quick action.	这种援助根本不需要长时间的调研，它所需要的是迅速采取行动。
Similar quick-impact measures should be undertaken to control disease.	应该采取同样的迅速起效方案来控制疾病的蔓延。
Small rural clinics can be built or rebuilt very quickly, within the first year of peace.	小型的乡村诊所能够在停火后一年内迅速建设或者重建。
Solar panels and wind turbines can provide off-grid power in isolated rural areas.	无须建设电网，太阳能电池板和风车也能为偏远的乡村地区提供能源。
Wells and cisterns can be put in place to ensure safe drinking water.	可以修建水井和水塔，确保饮用水的安全。
These and similar efforts can mean the difference between famine and food security, epidemic disease and health, income and utter poverty, and, most importantly, hope and despair.	上述措施和类似的努力能够避免饥荒，提供安全食品、消除流行病、确保人民健康、给普通人带来收入，消灭极端贫困，最重要的是，为人们驱除绝望，带来希望的曙光。
Yet the window of opportunity closes quickly.	但如果没有好好利用，机遇的大门很快就会关上。
Quick-impact economic development is exactly what is needed now to help end the horrific violence and suffering in Darfur.	迅速见效的经济发展是结束达尔富尔恐怖暴力和灾难的必由之路。
Sanctions, threats, and peacekeepers are only short-term measures, whereas real progress there against extreme poverty is not only achievable, but also is something that the government and rebels can agree on.	制裁、威胁和维和部队都只是短期的办法，而消除极端贫困的真正进展不仅可以实现，而且能够得到政府和叛乱势力的一致赞同。
The same applies in Somalia.	索马里的情况也是一样。
But the window of opportunity closes quickly in these and other post-conflict regions.	但在上面提到的战后地区和其他遭受战火蹂躏的土地，机会的大门很快就会关上。
Only by taking quick, meaningful action to fight hunger, poverty, and disease can there be a chance of creating conditions for long-term peace.	只有采取迅速、有效的措施来战争饥饿、贫困和疾病，才有机会为长久的和平创造条件。
	
Winning the Transition	实现转型成功
WASHINGTON, DC – Is the Arab Spring turning into a gloomy autumn?	华盛顿 — — 阿拉伯春天之后阴沉的秋天是否正在来临？
With brutal crackdowns in Syria, a bloody civil war in Libya, and Yemen teetering on the brink of chaos, the number of skeptics is growing.	随着叙利亚的残酷镇压、利比亚的血腥内战和也门在混乱边缘摇摇欲坠，持怀疑态度的人数正迅速攀升。
Although Egypt and Tunisia’s pro-democracy movements achieved rapid regime change, uncertainties remain in those countries, too.	虽然埃及和突尼斯的民主运动快速实现了政权更替，但这两个国家同样存在不确定性。
After a brief period of hope, many observers now wonder whether the region is capable of producing viable, and economically vibrant, democracies.	在短暂的希望过后，不少观察家现在怀疑该地区能否诞生能独立发展、充满经济活力的民主国家。
Revolutions and their aftermaths, of course, are always fluid and fickle times, and the outcome is often perched on a knife’s edge.	当然，革命和革命的结果往往都非常善变，而最终的结果往往系于千钧一发之间。
Bridging the vast gap between high expectations and the reality of limited budgets and capabilities is a test in itself.	弥合殷切希望和有限预算和能力之间的鸿沟本身就是一种考验。
Redressing past injustice and building an economy that offers opportunity to all are major challenges as well, fraught with volatility, uncertainty, and the dangers of political opportunism.	纠正既往不公和建设机会均等的经济也是一项充满波动、变数和政治机会主义风险的严峻挑战。
But transitions are also times of great opportunity.	但转型往往也伴随着巨大的机遇。
In the 1990’s, I was among those Indonesians who demanded and celebrated the departure of our own autocrat, Suharto, and I joined the new government when he left.	20世纪90年代，我曾经是要求并且庆祝独裁统治者苏哈托下台的印尼民众的一员，苏哈托离开后我加盟了新的政府。
Many observers predicted that Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim country, would be unable to sustain democracy and would ultimately decline into chaos.	当时很多观察家预测全世界人口最多的穆斯林国家印尼将无法保持民主制度，并最终陷入到混乱当中。
The task ahead of us was daunting.	令人生畏的任务摆在我们面前。
But we proved the skeptics wrong, and learned some fundamental lessons.	但我们证明了怀疑论者的错误，从中汲取了某些基本的经验。
Perhaps most importantly, we learned that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for democratization.	或许最重要的是，我们体会到没有放之四海皆准的通用民主化方案。
Each of the countries of the Middle East and North Africa will face unique challenges, which will have to be addressed on their own terms.	中东和北非的每个国家都面临各自的问题，这些问题的解决必须根据其自身的条件。
Even so, they all must make a real and symbolic break with the past.	即使如此，他们都必须从真正意义上与过去决裂。
The new authorities must send strong signals that the old ways are finished.	新政府必须明确旧的方式已经不复存在。
Change must be formally manifested, with new laws that are widely publicized.	改革和新的法律必须得到广泛宣传。
Legislation that empowers citizens with freedom of expression, free and independent elections, and freedom of association is crucial, and it must be made clear to the public that no one is above the law. Anything less will undermine the transition.	赋予公民言论自由、独立自由选举权和集会自由的法案至关重要，必须让公众明白没有人能凌驾于法律之上，否则转型就有可能遭到破坏。
Moreover, corruption is the bane of development everywhere, so new governments should move fast to establish institutions and procedures to fight it.	此外，腐败无论在哪里都是发展的祸根，因此新政府必须建立起与之斗争的机构和程序。
Transparency and accountability are powerful ideas with near-universal support, which means that new leaders should not give up when the fight becomes difficult.	透明制和问责制是近乎受到普遍支持的强大思想，也就是说新领袖不应放弃艰苦的斗争。
Civil-society organizations, local communities, representatives of the poor and vulnerable, and women play a vital role in this regard, and they should be included at every level of decision-making.	民间社会组织、地方社团、穷人和弱势群体代表及妇女在这方面所起的作用至关重要，他们必须参与到所有层次的决策当中。
In Indonesia, we signed a hundred laws in less than 18 months, covering everything from media freedom to elections, corruption, decentralization, and anti-trust rules.	印尼在不到18个月时间里签署了一百部法律，这些法律涉及媒体选举自由、腐败、权力下放和反垄断规则的方方面面。
We ratified new public-finance legislation and ensured the independence of the country’s central bank.	我们批准了新的公共财政立法，保障印尼央行的独立管理权。
New leaders must also expect and manage setbacks.	新领导人还必须预想并管理各种困难。
In post-revolutionary times, expectations are high, and the obstacles to meeting them are enormous.	在后革命时代人们的期望值空前高涨，而实现这些期望却面临着巨大的障碍。
I know from personal experience that we did not always have the luxury of getting the best outcomes.	我从亲身经历中得知我们并不总能得到最好的结果。
We had to compromise and settle for the best possible results.	我们必须学会妥协，接受最有可能的结果。
Security threats are among the most serious setbacks in transitions.	安全威胁是转型过程中最严重的障碍。
Nationalistic sentiment is strong, and politicians and interest groups can exploit it.	民族主义情绪空前高涨，政客和利益团体可能利用民族情绪达到自己的目的。
Often, the security forces are holdovers from the old regime, and there is no independent judicial system.	通常安全部队都来自旧政府的残余势力，独立的司法制度也没有建立。
Reforms will take time, and the old bureaucracies may not be able to implement them.	改革需要时间，而指望旧的官僚机构推进改革可能并不现实。
In Indonesia, we used various innovations to work around such dilemmas.	在印尼，我们采取各式各样的创新措施来解决这种两难局面。
For example, we appointed an independent judge to take over the bankruptcy and corruption courts, because career judges were too tainted.	比方说，我们指定一名独立法官接手破产和腐败法庭，因为职业法官已经染上了污点。
Likewise, when we started cash-for-work programs as part of our pro-poor agenda, we asked communities to run these initiatives.	同样，当我们启动穷人支持计划付现工作方案的时候，我们请求社会团体来推行这项计划。
More broadly, new leaders are well advised to ensure that the economy performs well.	更广泛的说，新领导人将得到充分的建议，以确保经济能够进入良性循环。
It is important to restore economic activity and create a favorable environment for entrepreneurs, particularly small and medium-size businesses, which constitute the main engine of job creation.	恢复经济活动并为企业家（特别是中小企业家）创造有利的环境非常重要，因为中小企业是创造就业机会的主要来源。
The recent revolutions, it should be recalled, started with the self-immolation of a Tunisian fruit vendor, who was harassed and insulted by the authorities.	我们应该记得一位突尼斯水果商人的自焚引发了最近这场革命���这名商人自焚是因为不堪忍受政府的侮辱和骚扰。
But economic success without accountability and social inclusion is not sustainable, and new governments often must face tough choices in order to protect the poor and vulnerable.	但是不具备责任和包容的经济成功不是持久的成功，新政府往往会为保护穷人和弱势群体而面临艰难的抉择。
They might have to abolish mis-targeted subsidies to free up resources for more targeted and efficient anti-poverty and job-creation programs.	他们可能需要取消错误的补贴，以节省更多资源用于更有针对性、更加高效的扶贫和就业创造计划。
In Indonesia, we had to draw a line between the very poor and the near-poor.	在印尼，我们不得不区分贫困和近贫人口。
We could not afford to raise salaries or provide subsidies for everybody.	我们没有能力提高工资，或为所有人发放补贴。
Our help had to be targeted.	我们的帮助必须有针对性。
So, while we helped the neediest, we excluded others who were not poor enough to benefit.	因此，我们在为最贫困群体提供帮助的同时，也把不够资格享受补贴的人群排除在外。
This was a tough and unpopular choice.	这项工作既不受欢迎又非常艰难。
Finally, countries in transition need support – not only money, but also technical know-how to implement highly complex reforms.	最后，转型国家需要支持 — — 其中不仅包括资金，也包括推进高度复杂改革的技术知识。
When I became Indonesia’s finance minister, I had 64,000 employees.	我担任印尼财政部长期间，手下拥有64，000位员工。
But when we had to modernize our tax system, we could not find the required expertise anywhere in our country.	但当我们需要改革税收系统的时候，却找遍全国都没有找到所需的专业人才。
Yes, we needed external assistance, but we never surrendered “ownership” of the reform process; we made it work for us.	是的，我们需要外部支持，但我们从未放弃对改革的“所有权 ” 。 我们的改革取得了成功。
If we Indonesians had not been in charge of our own transition, it could easily have failed.	如果印尼人没有领导我们自身的改革，那么改革很有可能会陷入失败。
That lesson, too, is one that all countries in transition should bear in mind.	所有处于转型时期的国家都应该汲取相关的经验。
	
Winning with Opium in Afghanistan	以鸦片制胜阿富汗
Despite considerable effort by the international community in Afghanistan since 2001 to eliminate the Taliban and al Qaeda, the insurgency in the south of the country has gathered momentum at breakneck speed in recent months.	尽管国际社会自2001年以来在铲除塔利班和“基地组织”方面付出了巨大的努力，但近几个月来，该国南部叛乱的形势还是以非常危险的速度发展着。
Our field research shows that we are not winning the campaign for the hearts and minds of the Afghan people – the Taliban are.	实地调查表明，我们正在赢得阿富汗民心的较量中落败—而塔利班却正在胜出。
Indeed, the international community’s methods of fighting the insurgency and eradicating poppy crops have actually helped the insurgents gain power.	的确，国际社会对抗叛乱和铲除罂粟作物的方式其实助长了叛乱分子的力量。
The international community has so far pursued policies of destruction, rather than the promised reconstruction.	国际社会到目前为止推行的是摧毁政策，而不是所承诺的重建。
The aggressive United States-led counter-narcotics policy of crop eradication has failed to win the support of Afghans, because it has triggered a chain reaction of poverty and violence in which poor farmers, with their only livelihood destroyed, are unable to feed their families.	美国领导下的激进的铲除种植的反毒品政策没有赢得阿富汗人民的支持，因为它引发了一系列贫困和暴力的连锁反应。 当贫穷农民唯一的生计被破坏以后，他们就连养家糊口也成了问题。
This has been exacerbated by the failure to provide even the most basic aid and development in the country’s poorest areas.	由于未能在该国最贫穷的地区提供哪怕最基本的发展援助，更加剧了这一局面的恶化。
At the same time, communities have been torn apart as a result of bombing campaigns, which have destroyed the very homes we came to protect.	同时，由于轰炸攻势使得居民社区支离破碎。 我们摧毁了本应受到保护的目标。
This, in addition to four years of drought, has forced entire families to leave their villages for makeshift internal refugee camps.	这一因素，加上长达四年的干旱，迫使许多家庭背井离乡，安顿到国内难民营的临时棚户中。
You do not win people over by bombing them, but by helping them.	轰炸得不了人心，而援助才是正道。
The Taliban have exploited the failures of the international community in extremely effective anti-Western propaganda that has fueled significant doubt in the minds of the public concerning the reasons justifying the international presence in Afghanistan.	塔利班在他们极为有效的反西方宣传战中利用了国际社会的失败。 这些宣传加深了公众对在阿富汗的国际干预合法性的质疑。
Sadly, our troops are often the first to pay the price – sometimes with their lives.	悲哀的是，我们的部队常常是首先付出代价的人—有时是生命的代价。
It is not too late to win back the hearts and minds of the Afghan people.	现在要赢得阿富汗的民心还为时不晚。
International troops are excelling in an exceptionally hostile environment, but this is not a war that will be won by military means alone.	国际部队在极端敌对的环境中保持着优势，但这场战争单靠武力是不能获胜的。
With public perception a crucial factor in winning the war, and the Taliban poised to launch a large military initiative next spring, failure to adopt a successful local strategy could signify the last chance the international community will have to build a secure and stable Afghanistan.	在民意成为制胜的关键因素，而塔利班又做足准备在明年春季发动一场大规模军事行动的情况下，如果不能采取成功的本地战略，那么就意味着国际社会将失去在阿富汗建立安全和稳定的最后机会。
But a successful strategy – one that responds to Afghanistan’s extreme poverty crisis –requires that the international community reverse course on crop eradication.	但是一个成功的战略—一个应对阿富汗的极端贫困危机的战略—需要国际社会在铲除鸦片的问题上反其道而行之。
In fact, the eradication of poppy crops not only damage local communities and undermines the international community’s goals, but it is also failing: opium production last year was at an all-time high.	实际上，铲除罂粟作物不但破坏了当地民生、阻碍了国际社会实现其目标，而且也是失败的：去年的鸦片生产创历史新高。
In September, the United Nations Office on Drugs Crime announced that poppy cultivation soared by a record-high 60%.	在九月，联合国毒品犯罪办公室宣布罂粟种植创纪录地增长了60 % 。
Eradication will never be successful in Afghanistan, because it destroys the single crop that will grow in the south’s harsh climate – and thus serves as the main source of income to millions of people.	铲除罂粟种植在阿富汗永远不会成功，因为它摧毁的是唯一一种能在南方的恶劣气候中生长的作物—而它又是上百万人的主要收入来源。
So a new, long-term, economically sustainable solution is urgently needed – one that directly engages with the communities that are suffering most – in order to achieve the support of the deeply impoverished rural population.	所以，现在急需一个新的、长期的、并且在经济层面上可持续的解决方案—一个与最困苦的当地社区直接相关的方案—从而赢得最贫困的农村人口的支持。
As a way to address this dilemma, the Senlis Council is proposing to run scientific pilot projects to research an opium licensing system for Afghanistan, which would be a core component of the economic reconstruction process.	作为摆脱困境的途径之一 ， “ 森利斯委员会 ” （ Senlis Council）正提议为研究针对阿富汗的鸦片许可体系而进行科学试点项目。 这可能会成为经济重建进程中的一个核心组成部分。
A system in which poppy is cultivated under license for the production of pain-killing medicines such as morphine and codeine would allow farmers to pursue their traditional livelihood and way of life, and, more importantly, to feed themselves and their families.	它是一种为生产吗啡和可待因等止痛药而特许种植罂粟的制度。 这种制度能让农民继续他们传统的谋生方式，更重要的是可以让他们养家糊口。
There is a global shortage of morphine and codeine, particularly in underdeveloped countries, where these vital medicines are often in short supply, if not completely unavailable.	全球的吗啡和可待因供应短缺。 特别在欠发达国家，这些重要药品即便不是没有也是紧缺的。
Not only would poppy licensing address the poverty and hunger crises that have engulfed the south of Afghanistan; it also would stabilize existing local structures, giving communities a reason to support President Hamid Karzai’s government and the international community.	罂粟种植许可制度不仅可以缓解笼罩在阿富汗南部的贫穷和饥饿危机；它还能稳定现有的本地架构，给与当地社会足够的理由支持卡尔扎伊总统的政府和国际社会。
Farmers would gain a sense of ownership in counter-narcotics efforts, in sharp contrast to the current idealistic – and evidently un-achievable – policy of crop eradication.	与现行的、理想主义的—且明显难以为继的—铲除行动形成鲜明对比的，是农民们在反毒品的计划中还能获得一种主人翁的感觉。
We must have the backing of the Afghan people if we are to defeat the Taliban.	如果要击败塔利班，我们必须要有阿富汗人民的支持。
By endorsing such an initiative, the international community would demonstrate that it is in Afghanistan for the good of the local population, which would help farmers sever ties with the insurgency.	通过采取如是的举措，国际社会可以证明它在阿富汗的目的是为了当地民众的利益，从而帮助农民切断与叛乱的联系。
But for such a system to be successful, the extreme poverty in the south of the country must first be our top priority.	但这样一个体系要取得成功，该国南方的赤贫问题就是我们的当务之急。
According to the World Food Program, 70% of the population lack food security.	据“世界粮食计划”统计，当地70%的人口缺少食品安��。
An immediate injection of emergency food and medical aid is urgently needed to break the vicious circle of suffering and violence.	马上输入紧急食物和医疗援助是打破困苦和暴力的恶性循环所急需的。
Only then could a new, long-term development strategy in Afghanistan – one that admits that the international community is not winning the war, and that the status quo is unacceptable – be implemented.	只有到那时，一个在阿富汗的新的长期发展战略—一个承认国际社会正在战争中落败，且当前形势不可接受的战略—才能付诸实施。
Licensing the opium crop would be a realistic and pragmatic cornerstone of that strategy’s success.	鸦片种植许可制度会是这一战略成功的一个现实而切实的里程碑。
	
The Western Alliance in the Digital Age	数字时代的西方联盟
MUNICH – This weekend, Helmut Schmidt and Henry Kissinger will participate in a discussion at the Munich Security Conference (MSC) – just as they did a half-century ago, when they took part in the first “Internationale Wehrkunde-Begegnung” (the forerunner of today’s conference).	慕尼黑—这个周末，赫尔穆特·施密特（Helmut Schmidt）和亨利·基辛格将在慕尼黑安全会议（MSC）上参与讨论 — — 半个世纪前，��MSC的前身第一次举办时，他们就曾经参与过讨论。
In the meantime, many developments around the world have given us reason to rejoice – but also to reflect.	与此同时，世界各地的许多发展趋势让我们兴奋，也让我们深思。
It is not only the crises extending from Ukraine to Syria that will prevent the MSC, the fiftieth, from becoming an exercise in self-celebration.	让第十五届MSC无法成为欢庆舞台的不仅仅是乌克兰和叙利亚危机的发酵。
The transatlantic partnership, traditionally the backbone of the conference, has seen better days than these.	大西洋两岸的伙伴关系，MSC的传统基石也不如以前那样牢固了。
The United States has now at least recognized that a great deal of trust has been lost in recent months, owing to the scale of surveillance undertaken by its National Security Agency.	如今，美国至少已经意识到，因为其国家安全局的监控行为，它在最近几个月损失了很多的信任。
President Barack Obama’s speech about reforms of US intelligence-gathering activities, as well as his subsequent interview on German television, represented a first attempt to regain the confidence of America’s allies.	总统奥巴马关于美国情报搜集行动改革的演讲以及随后参与的德国电视访问算得上重新争取美国盟友信任的第一批动作。
But it signals, at most, the beginning of an intensive transatlantic dialogue on the issue.	但这充其量只是开始加强关于这一问题的跨大西洋对话的信号。
The topic is too broad to be discussed solely among governments and secret services.	这个主题所涉太广，无法只在政府和秘密机构间讨论。
What we need is a more comprehensive international debate that engages, say, the American and German publics, as well as the US Congress and the German Bundestag – in short, an intra-Western debate about our relationship in the digital age.	我们需要的是一场更全面的国际讨论，包括（比如）美国和德国公众以及美国国会和德国联邦议会 — — 简言之，这应该是一场关于我们在数字时代的关系的泛西方的讨论。
In 1963, when Ewald von Kleist invited participants to Munich for the first conference, which Americans fondly call the “Wehrkunde” to this day, the motivating idea was to invite our most important allies to a discussion about the major strategic issues directly affecting Germany and NATO.	1963年，克莱斯特（Ewald von Kleist）来到慕尼黑参加美国人今天天真地称为“Wehrkunde”的第一届会议，其初衷是邀请我们最重要的盟友讨论直接影响德国和北约的重大战略问题。
The main topic, at that time, was the Atlantic Alliance’s nuclear strategy.	当时的主要议题是北约的核战略。
After all, Germany would have been the first victim of a nuclear confrontation between NATO and the Warsaw Pact countries.	毕竟如果北约和华约爆发核冲突，德国将是首当其冲者。
Kleist wanted to contribute to the creation of a German “strategic community,” which could make its own contributions to the NATO debate, rather than just absorbing whatever their technologically superior US ally proposed.	克莱斯特希望推动成立德国的“战略社区 ” ， 进而在北约的讨论中起到作用，而不仅仅是唯其名义上的上级美国的马首是瞻。
In a way, we are in a similar situation today.	从某种程度上说，如今我们面临相同的局面。
Though the security implications of the digital age are less tangible and not as destructive as a nuclear attack, the technological possibilities fundamentally alter the playing field of international relations.	与核打击相比，数字时代的安全影响并不那么有形，也不那么具有破坏性，尽管如此，技术可行性仍从根本上改变了国际关系竞技场。
The revelations concerning the NSA’s surveillance activities are just the start.	美国国安局监控行为只是揭开了冰山一角。
A future of “thinking drones” and defensive and offensive cyber weapons raises new ethical, legal, and political questions.	未来的“思想无人机”和防御性和进攻性网络武器将带来新的伦理、法律和政治问题。
We Europeans need to be self-critical and admit that we are not only lagging behind in terms of technical capabilities; we are also in danger of not fully grasping in time the possibilities and dangers of the digital world.	我们欧洲人需要自我批判并承认我们不但拖了技术能力的后腿；我们还有可能无法在第一时间把握数字世界的可能性和危险性。
And of course, we will hardly be able to engage in meaningful negotiations with the Americans on cyber issues unless we succeed in establishing a united stance within the European Union.	当然，除非我们在欧盟内部成功形成了统一战线，否则不可能与美国人展开有意义的谈话。
Doing so would put us in far better position to negotiate on equal terms with the US, just as we can on trade issues.	实现这一目标能让我们更加有利地与美国展开平等谈判，正如我们在贸易问题上做得那样。
In the past, the Western allies’ participation in NATO and its Nuclear Planning Group accommodated their concerns and prevented them from becoming mere objects of US strategy.	在过去，西方盟国加入北约及其核计划集团（Nuclear Planning Group）安抚了它们的担忧，也防止了它们沦为美国战略的目标。
Today, we need similar initiatives with regard to the digital world.	如今，我们需要在数字世界做同样的安排。
Those hoping to achieve true cooperation must be willing to make their own contributions.	要想形成真正的合作就必须做出自己的贡献。
This year’s MSC will include not only security officials from many countries.	今年的MSC不仅将包括来自多个国家的安全官员。
Three dozen German MPs and a significant US Congressional delegation will also participate.	三十六位德国联邦议会议员和庞大的美国国会代表团也将出席。
That is why the conference is an excellent opportunity to step up the transatlantic debate.	正因如此，本届会议将是建立跨大西洋讨论的绝佳机会。
After all, let’s be honest: there will be real changes in US intelligence agencies’ behavior only if Congress regulates their activities more strictly.	毕竟，我们应该坦承，只有国会更严格地规范其行为，美国情报机构的行动才会发生实质改变。
The revelations and resulting debates in recent months have shown that many US politicians are also uneasy about the liberties taken by the secret services.	最近几个月以来的事件发酵和由此带来的争论表明，许多美国政客也对秘密机构干涉自由深感忧虑。
However, without domestic pressure, little will change.	但是，没有国内压力就不可能出现多少变化。
It is all the more important that societal stakeholders – companies, NGOs, or international commissions of experts – both here and in the US become more heavily involved than before.	欧洲和美国的社会各界 — — 公司、非政府组织或国际专家委员会 — — 比从前更积极地加入其中是至关重要的。
This issue affects us all.	这一问题影响着我们所有人。
The debate is not – and should not be – between Europe and the US.	这一讨论不是 — — 也不应该是 — — 欧洲和美国的讨论。
Some Americans are grateful for Edward J. Snowden’s revelations about the NSA, which they believe have stimulated urgently needed public deliberation.	一些美国人也感谢斯诺登（Edward J. Snowden）揭发国安局，他们认为这刺激了急需的公共思考。
The institutionally assured possibility of self-criticism is, arguably, the West’s best characteristic – its outstanding trait.	有制度保证的自我批判是西方最优秀的品质，也是它的突出特征。
Our democracies are better organized than other systems to scrutinize their own policies and respond to criticism.	我们的民主制度在监督我们自己的政策和相应批评方面比其他制度更加井井有条。
In the 1960’s, the West had to agree on a common strategy for the nuclear age, and learn to deal with the atomic threat.	20世纪60年代，西方需要在核时代的共同战略上达成一致，并研究如何应对原子威胁。
Subsequently, we were able to take the first steps toward arms control and disarmament.	随后，我们就迈出了通向核武器控制和去核化的第一步。
Today, we need a similar debate in the West regarding our strategy for the digital age if we want to overcome new challenges without denying our identity as liberal democracies.	如今，西方需要类似的讨论思考信息时代战略，如果我们想克服新挑战又不否定我们的自由民主国家身份的话。
This weekend in Munich, the Schmidts and Kissingers of today and tomorrow will have an opportunity to engage in what is probably the most important strategic debate of our time: how to prevent the West from falling apart inthe digital age.	在本周末的慕尼黑，当代和未来施密特们和基辛格们将有机会参与可能是现时代最重要的战略讨论：如何防止西方在数字时代落于人后。
	
Germany’s Same Old Foreign Policy	德国外交政策老方一帖
MUNICH – More than ten weeks after its general election, Germany continues to be without a new government.	慕尼黑—大选已经过去十周，德国仍没有产生新政府。
But, though the post-election coalition negotiations have been unusually prolonged, there is little disagreement between the parties over foreign and security policy.	但是，尽管选举后的执政联盟谈判时间反常地长，在外交和安全政策上各党派之间并无多少分歧。
Indeed, when Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party (SPD) finally presented their coalition agreement on November 27, the working group on foreign and security policy had been finished with its job for two weeks.	事实上，当总理默克尔的基督教民主联盟（Christian Democratic Union）和社会民主党（Social Democratic Party ，SDP）在11月27日最终宣布执政联盟协议时，外交和安全政策工作小组已经完工了两个星期。
Except for a few tweaks that generally resonate more at home than with Germany’s European and international partners (such as requiring the government to be more transparent concerning arms exports to autocratic regimes), continuity and caution will remain the watchwords of German foreign and security policy.	除了一些总体上在国内比与德国的欧洲和国际伙伴引起更多共鸣的微调之外（比如要求政府在对专制政权武器出口的问题上更透明 ） ， 连续性和谨慎仍将是德国外交和安全政策的关键词。
Observers may disagree about whether German leaders’ stance provides a welcome sign of reliability or reflects a lamentable lack of diplomatic ambition.	观察者可能对德国领导人的立场代表着可靠的积极信号还是反映了可悲的缺少外交雄心有不同见解。
Those who hope for more active German leadership may well be disappointed by the new government.	希望看到德国领导人更加积极的人可能会对新政府感到失望。
Big ideas, or even big questions, are notably absent from the coalition agreement.	执政联盟协议的一个显著特征是看不见大思想，甚至连大问题都没有。
This is very much a reflection of many Germans’ views about themselves and their future: they are comfortable with the status quo, see no need for further reform proposals, are not interested in grand strategy, and would largely prefer to be left alone.	这在很大程度上反映了许多德国人对自己和未来的看法：对现状踌躇满志，认为没有必要进行进一步改革，也对宏大战略不感兴趣，宁可独自冷眼旁观。
Consider NATO policy.	就拿北约政策来说。
Successive German governments have maintained that the alliance should be, or even is, the place to discuss and decide on key security challenges.	连续几届德国政府都坚持该联盟应该成为 — — 甚至已经是 — — 讨论和决定重要安全挑战事宜的场所。
But Germany has at times been rather reluctant to take crisis issues to NATO headquarters.	但德国时不时会不愿意将危机问题拿到北约总部讨论。
And when it comes to provision of military and civilian security beyond what the coalition agreement calls “our geographic neighborhood,” the incoming government will favor enabling other regional organizations to do the job.	而在超越执政联盟协议所谓的“我们的地理邻居”范围之外的军事和民事安全问题，新一届政府更愿意让地区性组织来承担责任。
Or consider the question of Turkey’s accession to the European Union.	或者拿土耳其加入欧盟的问题来说。
Continuing disagreement between the coalition partners will not permit a proactive German role.	执政联盟伙伴一直存在分歧将让德国无法占据主动。
Instead, the compromise solution will be no solution: neither yes nor no.	相反，妥协方案也不是方案：既非是，也非否。
At the same time, some interesting new perspectives appear in the coalition agreement.	与此同时，���些有趣的新方面出现在执政联盟协议中。
For starters, the United States’ strategic “pivot” to the Asia-Pacific region is described as an opportunity for Europe to assert a coordinated foreign policy that finally plays a role in the development of cooperative policies in the region.	首先，美国的亚太地区战略“支点”被描述成欧洲主张最终能在该地区合作政策发展中起到作用的协作外交政策的机会。
Moreover, to encourage this outcome, the coalition agreement promises that the government will “adopt new initiatives to strengthen and deepen the Common Foreign and Security Policy” after the EU summit in December 2013.	此外，为了促进这一结果，执政联盟协议承诺政府将在2013年12月的欧盟峰会后“采取新措施强化和深化共同外交和安全政策（Common Foreign and Security Policy ） ” 。
It includes a call for an annual European Council session on security and defense, as well as for a strategic debate about the purpose of EU foreign relations.	其中包括呼吁增加一个关于安全和防务的欧盟理事会年度议程，以及一个关于欧盟外交关系的战略性讨论。
In addition, the German government will support European defense integration and maintain the establishment of a European army as a long-term goal.	此外，德国政府将支持欧洲的防务一体化，并把建立欧洲军队作为长期目标。
This may not amount to much in practice, but the language in this section is much less tepid than elsewhere.	或许这不会大规模落实，但这一部分的用词比其他部分都要温和。
Finally, the coalition agreement responds to concerns about Germany’s ability to be a reliable partner in NATO and EU military missions in a potentially more integrated EU defense organization.	最后，执政联盟协议回应了关于德国成为北约的可靠伙伴的能力以及未来一体化的欧盟防务组织中的欧盟军事任务的疑虑。
According to a 1994 ruling by Germany’s Constitutional Court, the German parliament has the final say when it comes to deploying soldiers.	根据1994年德国宪法法院判决，德国议会对于调遣军队问题拥有最终决定权。
However, Germany’s partners will hardly agree to integrate forces further if the German parliament were to retain a veto over their deployment.	但是，如果德国议会握有兵力部署否决权，那么伙伴国是不会同意武装力量的进一步一体化的。
The coalition partners disagree about how urgent it is to sort out this issue.	关于如何厘清这一问题，执政联盟没有达成一致。
Nonetheless, they have agreed that, within a year, a commission will provide different options and models to protect the German parliament’s rights while providing assurances to Germany’s European partners that the country will be a reliable contributor to troop deployments.	尽管如此，它们同意在一年内通过一个委员会提出不同观点和模式以保护德国议会的权利，同时向德国的欧洲伙伴国保证德国将是军事部署的可靠积极因素。
Should the SPD, which will vote on the coalition agreement in early December, block the formation of the new government (an unlikely development but not entirely out of the question), disputes over security and defense affairs would not be the culprit.	12月初，SPD将就执政联盟协议投票。 如果SPD不通过新政府的形成（可能性微乎其微，但不能完全排除 ） ， 罪魁并不在安全和防务事务的争议。
Aside from a few minor particulars, consensus prevails.	除了极少数次要方面，其余都以形成了一致。
For some, that is a cause for ambivalence.	对一些人来说，这造成了矛盾心理。
“I do not like the idea that Germany plays itself up to impose its will on others,” German President Joachim Gauck said recently. “Yet neither do I like the idea that Germany plays itself down to eschew risks or solidarity.”	“我不喜欢德国妄尊自大、将自己的意愿强加于他人的说法 ， ” 德国总统高克最近如是说 ， “ 但我也不喜欢德国妄自菲薄、逃避风险和团结的说法 。 ”
Whether German foreign policy can and should do more is a reasonable question.	德国外交政策是否可以以及应该做得更多是一个合理的问题。
To some degree, the new coalition will feel the pressure and consider the necessity to assume more responsibility for international leadership.	从某种程度上说，新执政联盟会感到压力，并认为有必要承担更多的国际领导责任。
But it will respond ever so slowly and ever so carefully.	但它会以极慢极谨慎的方式作出反应。
The bottom line is this: Expect no surprises from Germany.	总而言之，不要期望从德国身上收获惊喜。
Considering how difficult it has been for some, if not most, other EU countries to deal with the challenges of the last five years, that is actually rather good news.	考虑到一些（如果不是大部分的话）欧盟国家在过去五年中应对挑战的艰难，这实际上是一个大大的好消息。
	
Wolfowitz and the World Bank at Bay	陷入困境的沃尔福威茨和世界银行
Will World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz’s troubles finally catalyze real change at the World Bank?	世界银行总裁沃尔福威茨的困局是否会最终引发该行真正的变革呢？
Will there finally be an end to the archaic practice by which the President of the United States unilaterally appoints the head of the world’s most important development agency?	是否会最终废止古老的做法，也就是由美国总统单方面指定全世界最为重要的发展机构的领导人呢？
Facing an extraordinary rebuke from the Bank’s ministerial oversight committee and open revolt from his professional staff, Wolfowitz has faint hope of limping through the last three years of his term.	沃尔福威茨现在面临着世界银行部长监督委员会的指责以及该行员工的公开反叛，能够苟延渡过最后三年任期的机会渺茫。
The immediate uproar is over the exceedingly generous pay and promotion package that Wolfowitz awarded in 2005 to his girlfriend as compensation for leaving the Bank to pave the way for his arrival.	造成众怒的直接原因是沃尔福威茨在2005年提拔其女友以及极为大度的加薪以便其离开世界银行来为沃尔福威茨就任铺平道路。
At a time when the Bank has been emphasizing high governance standards as the key to development, the recent revelation of that arrangement’s details have dealt a serious blow to the Bank’s credibility.	在世界银行强调较高的管理标准作为发展的关键的时候，这一项安排的细节曝光对该行的信誉度是一个沉重的打击。
But even if Wolfowitz is eventually forced to resign, nothing will be gained if US President George W. Bush is allowed summarily to choose his replacement, as US Presidents have been doing ever since the Bank was founded after World War II.	但是，即使沃尔福威茨最终被迫辞职，如果美国总统布什像二战后世界银行成立以来的历届总统那样可以随意选择其接班人，那么，这还是于事无补。
Instead, the Bank’s head should be chosen in an open and transparent process that aims to select the best-qualified candidate, whether from the US, Europe, or the developing world.	相反，世界银行的领导人应当在一个公开和透明的程序中做出选择，这一程序的目的在于挑选最为称职的候选人，而无论其来自美国、欧洲抑或是发展中世界。
Indeed, a big part of Wolfowitz’s weakness today is the way he came to his job, as an in-your-face appointment from a US administration weak at international cooperation.	确实，沃尔福威茨现在的弱点的很大一部分是其任职的方式，也就是在由一个在国际合作上无所作为的美国政府专横地加以任命。
The World Bank is a development finance institution.	世界银行是一个发展金融组织。
But Wolfowitz’s background at the US State and Defense Departments gave him no real expertise or experience in either area.	但是沃尔福威茨在美国国务院和国防部的背景并不给他在任何一个领域提供实际的专长和经验。
Instead, his claim to fame was his role as architect of America’s failed war in Iraq.	相反，其名声在外之处却是作为美国失败的伊拉克战争的设计师角色。
By all accounts, Wolfowitz is brilliant, but it seems inconceivable that an open, transparent, and multilateral selection process would have chosen him to head the World Bank.	总体而言，沃尔福威茨是出众的，但是，一个公开、透明以及多边遴选程序挑选他领导世界银行是难以想象的。
I reach this conclusion even though I am sympathetic to the Bush administration’s desire to catalyze change at the Bank.	尽管我同情布什政府促进世界银行变革的愿望，但是我还是得出这一结论。
I have long advocated shifting the Bank’s center of gravity from lending to outright grants, a policy that the Bush administration strongly endorses.	我长久以来主张将该行的重心从贷款转移到直接赠款之上，布什政府强烈支持这一政策。
But choosing someone with no obvious background or experience in economic development was not the way to make progress on this front.	但是挑选某一没有明显经济发展背景或经验的人并不是在这一领域取得进展的途径。
A more open selection process, indeed, would have zoomed in on the fact that Wolfowitz’s girlfriend worked at the Bank.	确实，更为公开的遴选程序将会突出沃尔福威茨的女友在该行供职这一事实。
This may seem a trivial issue, but it is not, given the Bank’s strong policies to protect against nepotism.	这看似小事，但是鉴于世界银行严格的防止裙带关系政策，实则不然。
If Wolfowitz were otherwise overwhelmingly the most qualified candidate, the selection committee may have found a way to finesse the issue, openly and transparently.	如果沃尔福威茨是一个毫无争议、最为合格的候选人，那么，挑选委员会就可以公开和透明地找到妥善处理此事的办法。
But, given his questionable fit for the job in the first place, the girlfriend issue might have been disqualifying.	但是，由于他首先是否适宜担任此职就令人质疑，女友问题就可能令其不适宜这一职务了。
Why does the world meekly go along with the status quo and let the US dictate the Bank’s top position?	为何世界顺从当前的局面并且让美国独裁世界银行的最高职务呢？
It is a sorry tale of poor global governance.	这是一个不幸的全球管理不善事件。
Europe does not get in America’s way because it wants to maintain Europe’s equally out-dated privilege of appointing the head of the International Monetary Fund, the Bank’s sister institution.	欧洲并不想干涉美国，因为它想要维持欧洲所有的、同样也是过时的任命世界银行姊妹组织国际货币基金组织总裁的特权。
Asia has little choice but to defer to the US and Europe’s shenanigans because it is grossly under-represented in both organizations.	亚洲除了听从美国和欧洲的把戏之外选择不多，因为在这两个组织内它的代表权不够。
As for Africa, its leaders are loath to do or say anything that might interrupt the flow of World Bank largesse.	至于非洲，其领导人们不愿做或者说任何可能打断世界银行施舍的事情。
Many people, including myself, have long complained about the leadership selection process at the World Bank and the IMF.	包括我本人在内的许多人一直抱怨世界银行和国际货币基金组织的领导人遴选过程。
How can the Bank and the Fund continue to go around lecturing developing economies on good governance and transparency but fail to allow change in their own houses?	世界银行和国际货币基金组织如何能够继续向发展中经济体讲授良好管理和透明而又不在其自身机构中允许改革呢？
Now and again, both organizations pay lip service to the issue.	现在，两个组织都是再一次对这一问题文过饰非。
But so far, they have exhibited no real desire for change.	但是目前为止，它们还没有表现出变革的欲望。
To be fair, the IMF’s leadership is making a determined effort to give dynamic emerging economies, particularly in Asia, a bigger say in Fund governance.	公平而言，国际货币基金组织的领导层正在做出坚定的努力来给充满活力的新兴经济体，特别是亚洲在该组织管理中更大的发言权。
If carried far enough, this process would ultimately catalyze the necessary changes.	如果进行的足够多的话，这一进程将最终促进引发必要的变革。
Unfortunately, the IMF’s rebalancing efforts are proceeding at a glacial pace.	不幸的是，国际货币基金组织的重心平衡的努力进展过于缓慢。
At the World Bank, nothing seems to be happening at all.	在世界银行，好像根本就无动于衷。
Perhaps when Gordon Brown becomes the UK’s next prime minister, he will be able to convince the G7 group of rich countries to lead the charge for change.	可能当布朗成为英国下任首相之际，他将会能够说服七国集团率先变革。
As head of the Fund’s ministerial oversight committee, Brown understands the issues as well as anyone.	作为国际货币基金组织部长监督委员会主席，布朗与其他人一样理解这些问题。
Or perhaps the Wolfowitz debacle will prove to be the catalyst.	或许，沃尔福威茨的惨败会成为变革因素。
Maybe at last, the next World Bank or IMF president will come from outside their usual domains.	可能最终下一任国际货币基金组织或者世界银行的总裁会来自通常的领地以外。
There are plenty of great potential non-American candidates.	有许多不错的非美国籍的候选人。
South African Finance Minister Trevor Manuel has ably served as head of the World Bank’s oversight committee and would make a brilliant World Bank president.	南非财政部长曼努埃尔出色地担任了世界银行监督委员会的主席，可以成为该行杰出的总裁。
And it still could be a qualified American.	当然也会有合格的美国人选。
What about Bill Clinton?	克林顿如何？
One way or the other, the Bank and the IMF leadership selection process urgently needs to be revamped.	不管怎样，世界银行和国际货币基金组织的领导层遴选进程急需改革。
What the Wolfowitz debacle tells us most clearly is that the time for patience with the status quo is over.	沃尔福威茨惨败告诉我们最为清楚的是，对现状的耐心已经结束了。
	
Women and Development	女性和发展
COPENHAGEN – A girl born in South Asia or sub-Saharan Africa faces a cruel double burden.	哥本哈根—一个出生在南亚和撒哈拉沙漠以南非洲地区的女童面临着残酷的双重负担。
She will grow up in a region beset by poverty, disease, war or famine.	她将会在一个充满贫穷、疾病、战争或饥荒的地区成长。
She will also confront these challenges with the added disadvantage of being female.	她还要带着身为女性的弱势来面对这些挑战。
Although more attention is being given to gender issues, inequality persists in every culture, country, and continent.	虽然性别问题已经被给予了更多的关注，但不平等现象仍然在各个文化、国家和大陆存在着。
A new study for the Copenhagen Consensus project shows that eliminating this disparity is an investment with high payoffs.	一项关于哥本哈根共识项目的新近研究表明消除这些不平等是一项高回报的投资。
Despite global interest in education for all, many girls in poor countries continue to be denied basic education; right from the start, they are disadvantaged.	尽管有全球在普及教育方面的努力，但许多贫穷国家的女童仍然被剥夺了基本教育的权利；从一开始，她们就是弱势群体。
Three in five illiterate children in the world are girls.	世界上文盲儿童中的五分之三是女童。
Particularly in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, cultural norms and economic hardships stop parents from sending their daughters to school or from keeping them in school for as long as they enroll their sons.	特别是在南亚和撒哈拉以南非洲地区，文化传统和经济艰辛阻止了父母让他们的女儿上学，或让她们在学校里接受与儿子们同等时间的教育。
This unequal investment is neither equitable nor efficient.	这种不平等的投资既不公平又很低效。
An obvious solution is to build more schools in places where girls and boys must be educated separately.	一种显而易见的解决方案就是在男女不能同校的地方建立更多的学校。
In poor Muslim countries like Pakistan, Yemen, and Morocco, single-sex schooling is the norm, but many rural areas can afford only one public school, which is usually set aside for boys.	在许多贫穷的穆斯林国家，如巴基斯坦、也门和摩洛哥，单一性别学校是一种传统，但许多农村地区只能负担一所公立学校，而这所学校往往是针对男童的。
In theory, about half of the education gap in these areas could be closed by building girls’ schools.	从理论上讲，通过建立女子学校，这些地区的男女入学差距可以被缩小近一半。
Elsewhere, supply constraints are not the problem.	在其他地方，物力制约不是问题。
Instead, policymakers must find ways to strengthen the incentives for parents to send their daughters to school.	政策制定者们必须想办法强化让父母们将女儿送去读书的激励机制。
In countries where the family’s cost of schooling girls is lowered either by a no-fee policy or by a stipend for girls who enroll in school, girls’ enrollment rate increases.	在那些降低了家庭让女童接受教育的成本的国家（不论是通过免学费还是为女童入学提供补贴 ） ， 女童的入学率都增加了。
The experiences of these few countries lead us to propose a system whereby mothers are paid if their school-age daughters attend school regularly from the 3rd to the 9th grade. This would increase girls’ enrollment and also put money into women’s hands – important because studies show that money given to women is more likely to provide positive nutritional and health benefits for their children than money given to men.	这几个国家的经验让我们提议建立这样的一个体系：如果学龄的女儿们从三年级到九年级正常上学，那么她们的母亲将得到报酬，既增加女童的入学率又增加女性的收入—这是非常重要的，因为研究显示相较于男性，女性更会将得到的资助用于向她们的子女提供积极的营养和健康福利。
It also provides the women with greater bargaining power in their own households.	这也使女性在自己的家庭中更有发言权。
The annual cost per pupil would be $32.	每一个小学生一年的教育成本是32美元。
Covering every eligible girl in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia for a year would cost $6 billion.	让撒哈拉以南非洲和南亚的所有适龄女童接受教育的年成本是60亿美元。
Benefits from increased future wages and the reduction in health-care use would be between three and 26 times higher.	而从未来薪资增加和医疗费用降低中获得的收益要（比这成本）高3到26倍。
Pregnancy is one of the most vulnerable times for poor women; 99% of the 529,000 women who die annually from pregnancy-related complications live in developing countries.	妊娠期是贫穷妇女最为脆弱的时期之一；每年死于与妊娠有关的并发症的529000名妇女中，有99%都在发展中国家。
Severe malnutrition and the absence of prenatal care during pregnancy put both mother and child at serious risk.	严重的营养不良和妊娠期的产前护理缺失让母亲和小孩面临严重的风险。
Spending $3.9 billion on family planning and maternal health initiatives, such as provision of emergency contraception in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, could avert 1.4 million infant deaths and 142,000 pregnancy-related deaths in women.	在计划生育和妇科医疗方面（如在撒哈拉以南非洲和南亚地区提供紧急避孕服务）支出39亿美元，可以避免140万婴儿死亡和142000桩与妊娠相关的妇女死亡。
Making reproductive services available to women who cannot afford to pay their way can help prevent these deaths.	向经济上无力负担的女性提供生殖服务有助于避免这些死亡。
But such services must not shy away from promoting and providing modern contraceptive methods to avoid unwanted pregnancies.	但这些服务决不能羞于推广和提供现代避孕方法，从而避免意外怀孕。
Nearly 20% of women in developing countries report that they would like to stop having more children but are not using any form of contraception or family planning, possibly because reproductive services are not available.	发展中国家近20%的妇女表示不愿再生育更多的小孩，但却没有采用任何的避孕或计划生育措施。 这可能是因为生殖服务缺位。
For adolescent girls, early marriage or an unwanted pregnancy typically curtails schooling.	对青春期女童而言，早婚和意外怀孕通常会打断她们的教育。
Delaying marriage and childbearing allows them to gain more education and perhaps more earning opportunities, as well as improved health, education, and labor market success for their future children – benefits worth ten times more than the cost of providing reproductive services.	推迟结婚和生育能让她们获得更多的教育、更多的收入机会以及为他们未来的子女获得更好的医疗、教育和就业市场的成功—这样的收益是生殖服务成本的十倍。
Other tools, aside from schooling, can help women improve their income-earning ability.	除了学校教育之外的其它工具能够帮助女性提高她们创收的能力。
Microfinance institutions, such as Bangladesh’s Grameen Bank, play a vital role in allowing self-employed women to build profitable businesses.	微型金融机构，如孟加拉国的Grameen银行，在让从事自由职业的妇女创业赢利方面发挥了关键作用。
Small loans empower women by giving them more control over household assets and resources, more autonomy and decision-making power, and greater access to participation in public life.	小额贷款通过给予女性对家庭资产和资源更多控制权、更多自主和决策权以及更多参与公共生活的机会，提升了她们的权利。
Women are more likely than men to meet regular repayments and to spend their earnings on children’s health and education.	女性比男性更可能按时还款并将她们的收入用于子女的健康和教育。
Policymakers should continue to facilitate the rollout of microfinance programs.	政策制定者们应该继续为微型金融项目的实施提供方便。
Studies show that each dollar loaned by a microfinance institution increases household expenditure by almost 10% in the first year, and that the benefits will continue for another 30 years.	研究表明微型金融机构贷出的每一美元在第一年会使家庭支出增加10 % ， 而且这种收益会持续30年。
Benefits are estimated to end up about six times higher than the costs.	据估计总收益将比成本高6倍。
Though women have the right to vote in almost every country, gender inequalities in political representation remain large.	虽然在几乎所有的国家女性都获得了选举权，但在政治代表上的性别不平等仍然严重。
Governments should consider gender quotas at the local level of politics.	政府应该考虑地方政治中的性别配额。
Greater female representation may not necessarily lead to more emphasis on “female” policy priorities, but in India, village councils with gender quotas for village chiefs have higher levels of safe drinking water, better immunization coverage and roads, and less bribery.	更高的女性代表率不一定产生对“女性”政策优先的重视，但在印度，对村民委员会的委员有性别配额要求的地方，饮用水安全程度更高、疫苗接种率更高、路况更好，贿赂的情况也更少。
There may be some losses from electing women because they tend to have less political experience than men, but the record in India suggests that if it took 20 years to establish a 30% share of women in local positions in other countries, the benefits would be at least double the costs of achieving this.	女性当选可能会有一些缺憾，因为她们相较于男性政治经验往往不足。 但从印度的经验来看，如果花20年的时间使其他国家的地方官员中女性的比例达到30 % ， 那么其产生的收益至少是实现这一目标所耗成本的两倍。
Being a woman need not and should not be among the greatest challenges of life.	身为女性不需要也不应该成为生活中最大的挑战之一。
	
The Next Stage of Women’s Emancipation?	妇女解放的新阶段？
	伦敦—2018年2月6日是《人民代表法案 》 （ Representation of the People Act）诞生一百周年。
LONDON – February 6, 2018, marked the centenary of the Representation of the People Act, which enfranchised (some) women in Britain for the first time – a reward for women’s work during World War I. In honor of this historic event, statues of two leaders in the struggle for women’s suffrage, Millicent Fawcett and Emmeline Pankhurst, are to be erected in British cities.	该法案首次授予（部分）英国妇女选举权 — — 以表彰妇女在第一次世界大战期间做出的贡献。 为了铭记这一历史性事件，英国许多城市都为两位妇女参政权斗争的领导者 — — 米莉森特·福西特（Millicent Fawcett）和艾米琳·潘克斯特（Emmeline Pankhurst）树立了雕像。
The economic emancipation of women had to wait till after World War II, when permanent male labor shortages – the result, incidentally, of Keynesian full-employment policies – pulled ever more women out of domesticity and into factories and shops.	妇女的经济解放则要等到第二次世界大战之后，男性劳动力的长期短缺 — — 凯恩斯主义充分就业政策的偶然结果 — — 促使更多妇女走出家门，走入工厂和商店。
This second wave of emancipation concentrated on economic inequalities, especially discrimination in job selection and disparities in pay and property rights.	这一第二次解放潮集中在经济不平等上，特别是就业选择歧视和薪酬和财产权利不公。
These battles have also mainly been won.	这些斗争也大体赢得了胜利。
Discrimination in inheritance is long gone, and equal pay for equal work is accepted in theory, though a gender bias persists (as it does for selection to senior posts).	继承歧视早已不复存在，同工同酬也在理论上被接受，尽管性别偏见依然顽固（比如在高层岗位的遴选上 ） 。
For example, Carrie Gracie recently resigned as the BBC’s China editor in protest against unequal pay between male and female editors, shaming six top male employees to agree to substantial wage cuts.	比如，凯利·格雷西（Carrie Gracie）最近因为抗议男女编辑薪酬不平等而辞去BBC中国编辑一职，让六位高层男员工感到无地自容，被迫同意大幅减薪。
It is only a matter of time – of overcoming habit, prejudice, and inertia – before what is accepted in principle becomes practice.	从原则上被接受到转化为实践只是时间问题 — — 需要克服习惯、偏见和惯性。
The most interesting remaining argument for unequal treatment relates to activities for which there is a premium on physical qualities, as in sport.	对于待遇不平等问题，现有的最有趣的论点指出在一些活动存在身体条件溢价，比方说体育。
In traditional societies, men did the fighting, because they were stronger, faster, and taller.	在传统社会中，男性负责战斗，因为他们更强壮、速度更快、个子更高。
Not surprisingly, one of the last remaining bastions of unequal pay today is in competitive sport, which is a ritualized form of warfare.	毫不奇怪，当今薪酬不平等的最后几个堡垒之一便是竞技体育，即仪式化的战斗。
In most major sports, there are separate men’s and women’s teams and events, with lower standards of performance expected of women.	大部分体育项目分男女团队和赛事，对女子比赛的标准和预期表现都较低。
For example, men’s tennis matches often comprise up to five sets, compared to three for women.	比如，男子网球比赛通常为五盘三胜，而女子为三盘两胜。
The best men can beat the best women because they are stronger, hit the ball harder, and have more stamina.	最佳男选手能够击败最佳女选手，因为前者更强壮，击球力量更大，耐力更好。
In swimming, the longest race for men is 1,500 meters, while for women it is 800 meters.	在游泳比赛中，男子距离最长项目是1,500米，女子是800米。
One sport in which women compete equally with men is equestrianism – not just racing, but also dressage, show jumping, and three-day eventing.	女子与男子平等竞技的项目是马术 — — 不仅仅包括赛马，也包括盛装舞步、场地障碍赛和三日赛。
The question is whether pay ought to be equal in an area in which performance is unequal “by nature.”	问题在于，在表现“天然”不平等的领域，是否应该薪酬平等。
In tennis, the principle of equal pay for unequal performance is accepted for grand slam events, but not for many others.	在网球界，大满贯赛事接受了表现不同但薪酬相同的原则，但许多其他赛事并非如此。
Elsewhere, the gender pay gap remains striking, notably in football (soccer).	在其他项目上，性别薪酬差距巨大，特别是足球。
The captain of England’s professional women’s team, Steph Houghton, is paid just £65,000 ($90,000) a year, whereas Neymar, the world’s most expensive male player, receives roughly 500 times as much.	英格兰职业女子足球队长史蒂夫·霍顿（Steph Houghton）年薪只有65,000英镑，而最昂贵的男子选手内马尔（Neymar）年薪是这一数字的500倍。
And while players in England’s women’s super league earn an annual wage of up to £35,000, Chelsea’s male players are paid, on average, a staggering £4.5 million.	英格兰女足超级联赛球员年薪不超过35,000英镑，而切尔西男足选手平均粘性高达450万英镑。
One argument frequently made for equalizing pay is that sportswomen put in as much effort as sportsmen to produce their results.	要求薪酬平等化的一个常用论点是女运动员为了提升水平，付出了和男运动员一样多的努力。
This harks back to the old labor theory of value, which contended that all value was created by work.	这让人想起旧劳动价值论，即所有价值都由工作产生。
But the link between hours of work and market prices is almost non-existent in practice, which is why economists needed a different explanation for market prices.	但工作时间和市场价格之间的联系在现实中几乎不存在，正因如此，经济学家需要对市场价格做出不同的解释。
Economists today say that prices (including wages and salaries) are determined by consumer demand.	今天，经济学家说价格（包括工资和薪酬）由消费需求决定。
What a thing costs depends not on the amount of time and effort spent producing it, but on what it is worth to the buyer.	一样东西需要多少钱不取决于生产它用了多少时间、耗费了多少努力，而取决于它对买家有什么价值。
Male footballers are paid more than female players because their services are more in demand.	男足球运动员薪酬比女足球运动员高，是因为他们的服务需求更高。
If women’s football teams started paying their players the same as men’s teams, they would go bankrupt.	如果女足球队给队员和男足一样的薪酬，就会破产。
Unemployment is the price of insisting on being paid above the “market-clearing” level.	失业便是坚持支付高于“市场出清”水平的价格。
Market prices, economists insist, do not measure moral worth but market worth.	经济学家一直说，市场价格不衡量道德价值，只衡量市场价值。
If we want market-determined rewards to equate with “just” rewards, we either have to abolish markets – the socialist solution – or restructure individual preferences.	如果我们想要市场决定的奖励等于“公平”奖励，就必须放弃市场 — — 这是社会主义的方案 — — 或者改变个人偏好。
One argument is that women in sport would command the same market price as men, if only structural gender biases, such as greater media coverage and sponsorship for men’s sports, were removed.	一个观点是女运动员只有在结构性性别歧视 — — 比如男子项目能够获得更多的媒体覆盖和赞助 — — 被消除的情况下，才能要求和男运动员一样的市场价格。
Although market value may be determined by consumer demand, as economic theory has it, these preferences are themselves the result of socially structured gender biases.	尽管如经济学理论认为的那样，市场价值由消费需求决定，但这些偏好本身也是社会中的性别偏见的结果。
In the absence of these biases, demand for women’s sports – as measured by attendance at matches, television ratings, and so on – would equal demand for men’s sports.	如果不存在这些偏见，对女子项目的需求 — — 用看台上座率、电视转播率等指标衡量 — — 就能和男子项目等量齐观。
This argument is based on the assumption – which extends far beyond sports – that real gender equality will not be achieved until the formation of tastes and habits is no longer subject to gender stereotypes.	这一观点基于一个假设 — — 这个假设可以在体育的基础上推而广之 — — 即真正的性别平等要等到品味和习惯的形成不再受到性别成见的影响时才能实现。
Boys would not automatically be given toy guns, while girls are given dolls.	男孩不再自动被给予玩具枪，女孩不再被自动给予洋娃娃。
This sounds reasonable enough, until one recognizes the lengths to which radical feminists are willing to go to re-engineer tastes and preferences.	这看上起非常合理，但让我们看看极端女权主义者在重塑品味和偏好方面走得多远。
Language is being systematically purged of “gender bias.”	语言正在被系统性地清洗“性别偏见 ” 。
University courses in humanities and social sciences are being subjected to implicit or explicit forms of gender censorship.	人文和社会科学大学课程需要受到直接或间接的性别审查。
Gender itself is increasingly seen as “socially constructed”; and children, therefore, should be encouraged to choose their own gender.	性别本身被日益视为“社会产物 ” ； 因此，儿童应该被鼓励选择自己的性别。
To me, the latest offensive against men is a good cause gone mad.	对我来说，这一最新的仇男论是因为良好的初衷过犹不及。
But then, as a 78-year-old white male, I would think that, wouldn’t I?	但身为一名78岁的白人男性，我会想，我会吗？
	
Women for Integration	妇女的融合作用
COPENHAGEN – The past decade has proven again and again that empowering women worldwide holds the key to solving many seemingly intractable issues that have otherwise stymied policymakers. Poverty in the developing world seemed ineradicable until micro-lenders saw millions of low-income, destitute women as potential entrepreneurs.	发自哥本哈根 — — 在过去十几年中，事实已经不断地证明全世界那些被赋予权力的女性可以令那些困扰政策制定者的棘手难题迎刃而解：发展中国家的贫困问题看似无法根治，直到小额贷款者将数百万低收入的贫苦女性视为潜在的创业者就有了转机。
Involving African women in decision-making about crop production turns out to enable environmentally sustainable farming practices.	而将非洲女性纳入到农业政策制定过程中的举措则令到农业的环境可持续发展成为现实。
Runaway population growth becomes controllable when women have access to literacy and business opportunities as well as to contraception.	原本失控的人口增长率在妇女得到受教育权和经商权，以及学会避孕之后也变得有章法了。
Could the tensions and conflicts surrounding the issue of immigration in Europe be yet another issue for which the empowerment of women holds a solution?	那么围绕着欧洲移民问题所造成一系列紧张和冲突局面是否也能通过这些被赋予权力的女性来解决呢？
In a recent visit to Copenhagen to commemorate International Women’s Day, I took part in many conversations that duplicate others throughout Europe: citizens from across the political spectrum were struggling with the issue of non-European immigration and the cultural tensions that have ensued.	最近在赴哥本哈根庆祝国际妇女节的时候，我参加了许多场跟欧洲其他地方一模一样的对话：所有欧洲人，不管持有不同政治立场的，都纠缠于非欧洲移民以及随之而来的文化冲突问题。
What does it mean to be Danish, German, or French in the presence of these millions of newcomers, most of whom come from non-democratic societies?	许多丹麦人，德国人和法国人根本不明白这数百万新移民究竟意味着什么，更何况其中绝大多数移民甚至来自于非民主国家！
Some of this anxiety is pure racism; but some is not.	其中有些担忧纯粹是民族主义的；有些则不是。
What would “integration” mean, and how is it achieved without the loss of cherished civil-society values?	“融合”这个词究竟该如何解读，又该如何在不伤及市民社会价值理念的情况下达致融合？
These are not necessarily xenophobic questions: a post-enlightenment civil society, with a free press and due process, is a precious thing, and those values should not be sacrificed to politically correct moral relativism.	这可不仅仅是排不排外的问题：一个拥有新闻自由和法定程序的，后文明时代的市民社会是非常宝贵的财富，而这些价值观不应该被那些官员们只顾政治正确的道德相对主义而遭到抹杀。
This issue has been given new urgency by the arrests in Ireland of alleged jihadists from several countries who are accused of plotting to murder a Swedish cartoonist who drew an image of the prophet Mohammed as a dog.	在爱尔兰逮捕了多位试图谋杀一名将先知默罕默德描绘成一条狗的瑞典卡通画家的所谓圣战者之后，这个问题变得更加紧迫了。
Across Europe, the discussions are growing more intense as anti-immigration platforms gain supporters in otherwise liberal countries, from Germany to France to traditionally inclusive and tolerant Denmark itself.	有关这个问题的讨论在全欧洲都日趋激烈，反移民政党在其他自由主义国家都获得了更多的支持，从德国，法国，一直到传统上比较平等包容的丹麦。
Then I witnessed the prototype of a true solution.	但随后我看见了一个真正解决方案的雏形。
I met Elisabeth Møller Jensen, the director of KVINFO, “the Danish center for information on gender, equality and ethnicity” – an extraordinary organization funded by Denmark’s Ministry of Culture.	我碰到了丹麦性别，平等和种族信息中心的主管伊丽莎白·穆勒·詹森，她所在的是个受丹麦文化部资助而且非同寻常的机构。
One of its many innovative programs is already showing results in terms of genuinely integrating immigrant families into Danish society.	而该中心的其中一个创新性项目则已经在移民家庭真正融入丹麦社会方面取得了成果。
By addressing immigrant women – and by viewing them as potential leaders, rather than as quiescent potential maids or service workers – KVINFO is enabling their families to witness the benefits of an open civil society in their own lives.	通过把女性移民视为潜在的领导者 — — 而不是沉默的候补保姆和服务员 — — 中心使得她们的家庭可以亲身见证一个开放社会所带来的好处。
KVINFO began a “mentor network” aimed at immigrant and refugee women in 2002.	在2002年，中心启动了一个专门针对女性移民和难民的“顾问网络 ” 。
By 2010, it had 5,000 participants, had won awards and international acclaim for best integrative practices, and is being replicated throughout Denmark – and observers are exploring programs or partnerships modeled upon it in Canada, Spain, Portugal, and Norway.	时至今日，这个网络已经有5000名参与者，并在融合实践中赢得了奖项和国际声誉，并在丹麦全国推广 — — 而参观过这个项目的人又将其模式复制到加拿大，西班牙，葡萄牙和挪威。
The program pairs refugee and immigrant women in a one-to-one mentoring relationship with women who are established leaders at all levels of Danish society.	而这个项目的做法就是让女性移民和难民和丹麦社会中的各级女性领袖结成“一对一”的顾问关系。
The pairing is not cursory.	这个配对可不是随便安排的。
A careful matchmaking process unites the interests and goals of the women on both sides, and already has paid amazing dividends.	一个精心设计的配对程序将双方的兴趣和目标结合起来，并结出了丰硕的成果。
Women who were journalists, engineers, or scientists in their countries of origin – and who could not get jobs as checkout cashiers in Denmark – have been paired with Danish counterparts and are now back in school, or working in research.	那些在原住国身为记者，工程师和科学家，却在丹麦连个超市收银员都当不上的妇女和丹麦当地的女性同行结成一对，得以回到学校或者投身研究工作之中。
But even women who arrive with no higher education or professional skills create an “action plan.”	而那些没有高学历或者专业技术的女性也制定了一个“行动方案 ” 。
They learn from their mentors what options there are, how to proceed, and what to do to reach their objectives.	她们从自己的结对顾问那里学到了如何选择，如何运作以及如何行动去实现自身目标。
As they enter the workforce, their language skills improve, their household income soars, and their children see firsthand a woman in a respected, economically valued role.	随着她们投入到工作当中，她们的语言能力得到提高，家庭收入增加，而她们的孩子则亲眼看到了一个有尊严，有经济能力的女性。
Their loved ones thus learn how to thrive in a European context – occasionally coming to KVINFO events and benefiting from their mothers’ expanding network of contacts.	孩子们也因此学到如何在欧洲的文化背景下取得成功 — — 偶尔还能来参加中心的活动并从母亲不断扩大的社会联系网中获益。
So, rather than feeling exploited and condemned indefinitely to the fringes of a Northern European society – and thus vulnerable to the stirrings of demagogues and extremists – these women’s children grow up fully familiar with Danish civil society, well informed about higher education and professional opportunities, and hopeful rather than cynical.	因此，这些妇女的后代就不会在一个北欧国家的社会边缘中感到无尽的剥夺和不幸，并因此易于受到煽动者和极端分子的蛊惑，而是在对丹麦市民社会的充分理解中成长，被赋予更高的教育水平和职业机会，对生活充满希望而不是愤世嫉俗。
By empowering women, the whole family is lifted up and, in a supportive rather than a colonizing way, “Europeanized” in the best sense.	通过这些被赋予权力的妇女，整个家庭都通过一个支持性而不是殖民式的方式得到提升，用最好的方式实现了“欧洲化 ” 。
I am often struck by the way many Europeans use arms-length euphemisms when talking about immigrants: they want immigrants to feel “welcome” or “comfortable.” I always wonder, “But do you want them to feel French, or German, or Norwegian?”	我常常惊讶于许多欧洲人在谈论移民时喜欢用一些特别冗长委婉的词汇：他们希望移民能感觉到“受欢迎”和“舒适 ” ， 我一直在想：你为什么不让他们感觉特法国，特德国，或者特挪威呢？
To be fully integrated, Muslim and other newcomers to European countries must be welcomed not as perpetual visitors – even if, ideally, as nicely treated visitors – but rather as family members, as the American model does (or aspires to do).	为了实现完全融合，穆斯林和其他欧洲各国的新移民不应被被视为“永久性访客 ” （ 甚至理想化地视为受到良好照顾的访客 ） ， 而应该像美国模式（或努力追求的）那样被视为家庭的真正成员。
As Møller Jensen put it, “I want these children to feel Danish .”	正如穆勒·詹森所说 ： “ 我希望这些孩子都觉得特丹麦 ” 。
These young people and Denmark itself will benefit, as this “KVINFO generation” grows up with a genuine stake in Danish civil society, and seeing the world as Danes, not as guests.	随着“中心一代”在一个纯正丹麦市民社会的基础上成长，并以丹麦人而不是外来人的视角来看待这个世界，获益的将不不止是他们自己，还有这个国家。
	
Arab Women’s Unfinished Revolution	阿拉伯妇女未竟的革命
FEZ – Though women across the Middle East participated actively in the Arab Spring protests that began in late 2010, they remain second-class citizens, even where popular uprisings managed to topple autocratic regimes.	费斯—尽管中东地区的妇女积极地参与了2010年末开始的阿拉伯之春起义，但她们仍是二等公民，即便在群众起义推翻了独裁统治的地方也是如此。
Indeed, the Islamist governments now in power in several countries seem more determined than the despots that they replaced to keep women out of politics.	事实上，如今，不少国家掌权的伊斯兰政府比被他们取代的暴君更热衷于将妇女排挤在政坛之外。
In conducting interviews with women in the region, I am struck by their overall pessimism.	在采访该地区妇女的过程中，我被她们的悲观情绪深深地震惊了。
They fear the loss of their rights.	她们担心丧失权利。
They see economic disintegration all around them, raising the possibility of a further increase in violence.	她们认为经济崩溃随处可见，这让暴力进一步升级的可能性大大增加。
As social bonds fray, they feel increasingly vulnerable.	随着社会契约的腐蚀，她们感到越来越无助。
More than once, I heard them express the view that things were better before the revolutions.	我不止一次听她们表示目前的状况还不如革命之前。
Female representation in parliaments and government cabinets after the Arab Spring has been either absent or meager, and women activists worry that Islamist parties will implement reactionary policies that discriminate on the basis of gender.	阿拉伯之春后，国会和政府内阁中的女性代表要么不存在，要么无足轻重，妇女活动家担心伊斯兰政党会采取性别歧视的反动政策。
In Egypt, for example, the Freedom and Justice Party, which dominates the parliament, claims that a woman cannot become President.	比如，在埃及，占据议会多数的自由公正党（Freedom and Justice Party）宣布不能由女性出任总统。
Egyptian women were heavily represented in the protests that brought down former President Hosni Mubarak’s regime in 2011, but they have been largely excluded from any official decision-making role ever since.	在2011年推翻前总统穆巴拉克的起义中，妇女居功至伟，但在此后的所有决策过程中都鲜有女性身影出现。
In Morocco, while there were eightwomen in the previous cabinet, today there is only one in the Islamist-led government.	在摩洛哥，上任内阁中有八名妇女，而在今天的伊斯兰政府中只剩下一名。
In January, the Islamist-dominated parliament adopted a decree lowering the age of marriage for girls from 18 to 16, a major setback.	1月，伊斯兰教徒占多数的议会采纳了一项法令，将女孩适婚年龄从18岁降至16岁，这是一次大倒退。
Moroccan feminists have protested vigorously, but to no avail.	摩洛哥女性强烈抗议，但完全无用。
Parliamentary representation for women has also taken a hit.	议会中的妇女代表也遭受了打击。
Women hold less than 1% of seats in the current Egyptian parliament; previously, they held 12%.	目前埃及议会的妇女代表数量不到1 % ； 此前曾达到过12 % 。
In Libya, a first draft of the electoral law reserved 10% of seats in the constituent assembly for women, but the quota was later abandoned.	在利比亚，选举法第一草案为妇女保留了10%的制宪大会议席，但这一配额后来被取消了。
In Tunisia, the election in 2011 brought 49 women into the 217-seat Constituent Assembly.	在突尼斯，2011年的选举将49名妇女选入了217人的制宪大会。
But 42 of these women are members of Ennahda, which regards Sharia (Islamic law) as the source of legislation.	但其中42人是复兴运动党（Ennahda）成员，该党认为伊斯兰教法才是合法性的源泉。
Long-time Tunisian activists fear that Ennahda, which dominates the assembly, will use the presence of women MPs to restrict women’s rights.	突尼斯的长期活动家担心在制宪大会占多数的社会运动党将利用妇女议员阻挠妇女权利。
The recent assassination of the secular Tunisian opposition leader Chokri Belaid has raised the stakes for women there.	最近发生的行刺突尼斯世俗反对派领袖贝莱德（Chokri Belaid）事件让人担心该国妇女的命运。
Belaid was a voice on behalf of women’s rights, and the threat of increased political violence will focus on those who advocate secular equality for all Tunisians, including women.	贝莱德是妇女权利的拥护者，政治暴力抬头的威胁将集中在支持所有突尼斯人（包括妇女在内）世俗平等的人头上。
Unfortunately, conservative forces in the Arab world repeatedly turn against women when political unrest spreads.	不幸的是，在政治动荡蔓延时，阿拉伯世界的保守势力一再反对妇女。
In Bahrain, several women protesters have been arrested and tortured.	在巴林，不少妇女示威者被逮捕并遭受严刑拷打。
In Yemen, the authorities call on male relatives to “tame” their women.	在也门，当局要求男性亲属“管教好”家中的女人。
In Tunisia, the most Westernized of the Arab countries, women have been attacked at universities and schools, and are being forced to wear the hijab.	在最西方化的阿拉伯国家突尼斯，大学和学校中的女性频频遭袭，并被迫戴上面纱。
A woman who was allegedly raped by two policemen in September 2012 was charged with public indecency when she filed a complaint.	一名据称于2012年9月被两名警察强奸的妇女在提起申诉时被指公开猥亵。
Likewise, in Egypt, women protesters face greater scrutiny than men.	类似地，在埃及，女性示威者面临着比男性更严格的审查。
Those arrested by the military during the anti-Mubarak protests were subjected to virginity tests as a form of intimidation.	在反穆巴拉克起义期间被捕的女性需要接受贞洁测试，以此作为恐吓手段。
Across the Middle East, Islamist militias have harassed, arrested, raped, and tortured women pro-democracy activists.	在整个中东，伊斯兰军队骚扰、逮捕、强奸和虐待女性民主活动者。
The model of Iran’s Islamic Revolution in 1979, which imposed second-class citizenship on women, is frequently cited as a threat in Arab countries now ruled by Islamist parties.	1979年伊朗伊斯兰革命的模式 — — 将妇女视为二等公民 — — 被频繁视为如今由伊斯兰党派执政的阿拉伯国家的一大威胁。
These countries are at a crossroads.	这些国家都面临抉择。
Women make up half of the Middle East’s population, and any hope of political and economic development must account for that fact.	妇女占据中东人口的一半，任何政治和经济发展希望都必须考虑到这一事实。
Organizations like the United Nations Development Program have repeatedly issued reports demonstrating the connection between economic decline and oppression of women.	联合国发展计划署等组织一再发布报告，说明经济衰落和压抑女性之间存在��联。
Simply put, the Arab countries will not succeed unless women are fully integrated into political and economic life.	一言以蔽之，除非妇女充分融入政治和经济生活，否则阿拉伯国家不可能获得成功。
In her Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech in 2011, Yemeni political activist Tawakkol Karman, made the point clearly: “The solution to women’s issues can only be achieved in a free and democratic society in which human energy is liberated, the energy of both women and men together.”	在2011年诺贝尔和平奖获奖演说中，也门整治活动价卡尔曼（Tawakkol Karman）明确指出 ： “ 妇女问题的解决方案只有在民主社会中才能达成。 在民主社会中，人类能量得到了解放，女人和男人的能量都得到了解放 。 ”
Middle Eastern countries should protect and consolidate women’s rights as a way to reinforce democratic ideas and habits.	中东国家应该保护和巩固妇女权利，以此作为强化民主思想和习惯的方式。
They must institute the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international laws and agreements in order to eradicate gender-based discrimination and violence.	它们必须将《世界人权宣言》和其他国际法和协定制度化，以此消灭性别歧视和暴力。
The hope for women’s progress is really a hope for a decent society in which development for all is possible.	妇女进步的希望就是美好社会的希望，就是一切发展皆有可能的希望。
	
A Woman’s Place Is in the Digital Revolution	妇女的地位在于数字革命
MONTREAL – Digital technologies are a double-edged sword for the world’s women.	蒙特利尔—数字技术对全世界妇女而言是一柄双刃剑。
Men’s greater access to these technologies puts women at risk of being left even further behind economically and socially.	男性更容易获得这些技术，这使得妇女有可能在经济和社会角度进一步落后。
But if women can tap the full power of digital technologies, vital new opportunities will open up for them.	但如果妇女能够充分利用数字技术的力量，就能获得至关重要的新机会。
According to estimates by the GSM Association, women’s access to the Internet and mobile phones is about 85% of the level for men, on average, and a total of 1.7 billion women in low- and middle-income countries are unconnected.	据GSM协会的估计，妇女能够上网和拥有手机的比例平均而言只有男性的85%左右，中低收入国家的17亿妇女无网可上。
This severely limits the prospects of women and girls.	这严重限制了妇女和女童的前景。
Digital technologies enhance women’s access to finance, with mobile banking enabling them to avoid long journeys to a branch or ATM.	数字技术能增加妇女的金融普及，移动银行让她们不再需要长途跋涉才能用上网点或ATM机。
Likewise, technology-enabled health care delivered via phone or tablet improves health outcomes, as it reaches women even in the remotest areas, sparing them a long and often risky trek to see a doctor.	类似地，基于技术的医疗通过手机或平板电脑实现，能够改善健康结果，即使是最偏远地区的妇女也能获得这些服务，而不再需要冒风险长途跋涉去看医生。
The timesaving potential of digital technologies is so great that they may make the difference in enabling women to seek paid employment.	数字技术在节约时间上的潜力非常巨大，有可能打开妇女寻找带薪工作的新局面。
Today, women undertake three-quarters of all unpaid care work, producing output of around $10 trillion, or 13% of global GDP – none of which is translated into income, let alone economic power.	如今，妇女承担了四分之三的无薪工作，贡献了大约10万亿美元的产出，或全球GDP的13 % — —其中没有一分钱转化为她们的收入，更不用说经济实力了。
By their nature, e-commerce and technology-based businesses offer women more flexibility and autonomy, helping them to manage home responsibilities alongside paid work.	电子商务和基于技术的企业天然能够为妇女提供灵活性和自治力，帮助她们做家务和挣工资两不误。
In Indonesia, women-owned businesses generate 35% of e-commerce revenue, compared with only 15% of the revenue of offline businesses.	在印度尼西亚，妇女所有企业创造了35%的电子商务营收，而线下企业的这一比例只有15 % 。
Likewise, in China, 55% of new Internet businesses are founded by women, and Alibaba’s Taobao e-commerce platform has an equal number of male and female store owners.	类似地，在中国，有55%的新互联网企业由妇女创办，阿里巴巴的淘宝电商平台上男女店主数量一样多。
In fact, China is home to 114 of the world’s 147 self-made female billionaires, compared to just 14 in the second-place country, the United States.	事实上，全世界147位白手起家的女亿万富豪有114位在中国，而第二名的美国只有14位。
Women’s economic empowerment is good not just for the women who benefit.	妇女经济赋权的好处不只限于妇女受益者。
The McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) has estimated that advancing gender equality could add $12 trillion per year to the world economy by 2025.	麦肯锡全球研究所（MGI）测算，到2025年，性别平等的改善每年能够为世界经济增加12万亿美元产出。
In the Asia-Pacific region alone, getting more women into full-time employment in higher-paid, higher-productivity sectors could add $4.5 trillion per year to GDP, 12% above the current trajectory.	光是在亚太地区，让更多妇女在薪酬和生产率更高的行业获得全职工作每年能增加4.5万亿美元GDP，较当前水平提高12 % 。
At the company level, a growing body of evidence shows that more gender equality is good for bottom lines.	在公司层面，越来越多的证据表明促进性别平等对利润有利。
Greater diversity of leadership styles improves the quality of decision-making. If given the opportunity, women could be leading innovators in the age of automation and artificial intelligence, and could help to ensure that algorithms are free of gender bias.	领导风格的多样化能改善决策质量，在得到机会的情况下，妇女能够在自动化和人工智能时代成为创新领导者，帮助确保算法免受性别歧视干扰。
But major barriers prevent women from seizing these opportunities.	但妇女要抓住这些机会，面临着巨大的障碍。
For example, in India, where only 29% of all Internet users are female, girls in rural areas often face gender-based restrictions on their use of information and communications technologies.	比如，在印度只有29互联网用户是女性，农村女童常常会因为性别而被限制使用信息和通讯技术。
One village in Uttar Pradesh implemented a fine for any girl using a mobile phone outside the home.	在北方邦的一个村庄，女童在家外使用手机会被罚款。
Beyond the social attitudes that undermine women’s access to digital technologies, women and girls often disproportionately lack the requisite skills to seize the opportunities of the digital age.	除了社会态度干扰妇女获得数字技术之外，妇女和女童还常常缺少抓住数字时代的机会所需要的技能。
In Singapore, for example, women lag behind men in education in science, math, engineering, and technology.	比如，在新加坡，妇女的科学、数学、工程和技术教育水平落后于男性。
At Nanyang Technological University, females comprised only 27% of the undergraduate computer-science program in 2015-2016, despite accounting for half of all undergraduates at the university.	在南洋理工大学，2015—2016学年计算机科学专业本科生女生数量只占27 % ， 尽管全部本科生中有一半是女生。
What is at stake is not just women’s ability to seize the opportunities offered by the digital revolution, but also their capacity to withstand the coming wave of automation.	重要的不只是妇女抓住数字革命所提供的机会的能力，也包括她们面对即将到来的自动化浪潮的能力。
According to MGI research, in Singapore alone, 800,000 full-time-equivalent jobs could be displaced by 2030 due to automation.	据MGI的研究，光是在新加坡，到2030年有800,000个全职等价工作可以被自动化所取代。
The jobs that are most vulnerable to automation are the low-paid, lower-skill jobs that women are more likely to hold.	最容易受自动化冲击的工作是低薪低技能工作，也是妇女更有可能从事的工作。
At the same time, though automation risks disrupting many jobs (or tasks within jobs) for both men and women, it also takes some of the drudgery out of current work, tailoring it to human abilities.	与此同时，尽管自动化风险对男性和女性的许多工作（或工作任务）都构成了破坏，但它也承担了当前工作的一些苦力活，让工作更能彰显人的能力。
The result could be higher wages that contribute to the creation of more new jobs – 300-365 million worldwide – as spending increases, with emerging economies gaining the most.	结果可能是工资提高，形成更多新岗位 — — 全世界范围内高达3—3.65亿个 — — 原因在于支出增加，其中新兴经济体获益最多。
Furthermore, among the new jobs that will be created will be many in fields like education and health care, where women have traditionally thrived.	此外，新形成的工作岗位许多在于教育和医疗等传统女性优势领域。
According to MGI research, more than 100 million jobs could be created over the next 10-15 years as health care and education needs grow.	据MGI的研究，随着医疗和教育需求的增加，未来10—15年能够创造出1亿多个工作岗位。
It is not yet clear exactly how automation will affect women’s employment.	自动化具体如何影响妇女就业尚不清楚。
But there is no doubt that protecting – and even enhancing – women’s job and income prospects will require upgrading their skills, so that they can take advantage of the new and changing opportunities created by the ongoing digital revolution.	但毫无疑问，保护 — — 甚至加强 — — 妇女就业和收入前景需要升级她们的技能，以便她们能够抓住数字革命所创造的日新月异的机会。
The success of women in e-commerce attests to the power of digital technologies to level the economic playing field, to the benefit of individual women, their communities and societies, and the world economy.	妇女在电子商务方面所取得的成功证明了数字技术在建立公平竞争以及为妇女个体、社区和社会，以及世界经济带来收益等方面的力量。
More women in work – particularly in the technology industries that are shaping our collective future – would be good news for all.	更多女性进入职场 — — 特别是改变着我们的集体未来的科技行业 — — 对所有人都是好消息。
	
The Media’s #MeToo Problem	媒体的“米兔”问题
LONDON – Journalism classrooms may be dominated by women, but global media are still ruled by men, who occupy the majority of management positions, report more news stories and are more frequently presented as expert voices.	伦敦—新闻学教室中也许大部分是女性，但全球媒体仍然由男性主宰，他们占据了大部分管理岗位，报道更多新闻，也更常代表专业声音发声。
This imbalance is reflected in the content newsrooms produce, with fewer written words and broadcast seconds dedicated to telling women’s stories.	这一失衡反映在新闻编辑室所“生产”的内容中，用于讲述女性故事的纸媒文字和广播声音都更少。
It is also reflected in the industry’s culture, which leaves women more vulnerable to sexual harassment and abuse.	它也反映在行业文化中，女性更容易受到性骚扰和侵犯的影响。
Given the importance of relationship-building in media, not to mention the desire for connection among journalists who cover extreme or harrowing events in difficult environments, intimate ties can easily form among colleagues and associates.	在媒体行业，构建关系十分重要，尤其是排除万难报道极端或恐怖事件的记者们更加渴望联系，因此，同事和搭档之间很容易形成紧密联系。
The problem arises when these relationships turn sour or, worse, when they are non-consensual or based on coercion, such as when a more senior colleague pursues a sexual relationship with a subordinate.	当这些关系变坏，或者更糟糕地，当它们变成非自愿或基于强迫时，问题就会产生，比如上司要求和下属发生性关系时。
Of course, across countries, there can be significant differences in what is considered predatory or inappropriate behavior.	当然，不同国家对于侵犯或不恰当行为的定义大相径庭。
But, globally, almost half of women journalists report having experienced work-related sexual harassment, according to a 2014 study by the International News Safety Institute (INSI) and the International Women’s Media Foundation (IWMF).	但据国际新闻安全研究所（INSI）和国际妇女媒体基金会（IWMF）的一项2014年的研究，全球而言，近一半的女记者报告经历过与工作相关的性骚扰。
Two-thirds reported that they had faced “intimidation, threats, or abuse,” mostly by bosses, supervisors, or co-workers.	三分之二的女记者报告她们曾面临过“恐吓，威胁或暴力 ” ， 这些行为大多来自上司、督查和同事。
For perpetrators, impunity remains the norm.	施害者通常不会受到任何惩罚。
Almost three-fifths of respondents in the INSI/IWMF study who had experienced harassment said that they had reported incidents to their employers.	在INSI/IWMF的研究中报告曾经历过性骚扰的受访者中，有近五分之三说她们向雇主报告过情况。
In most cases, however, it was the women who experienced the abuse who suffered adverse consequences: damaged reputations and career prospects, not to mention the impact on their psychological and emotional wellbeing.	但最常见的结果是遭受暴力的女性承受负面后果：名声败坏，职业生涯受阻，更不用说身心伤害了。
So while men with histories of predatory behavior continue to occupy senior positions in the global news industry, women journalists are pushed to the point that they consider leaving it.	因此，有过侵犯行为史的男性继续占据全球媒体行业高位，而女记者被推向被迫离开媒体业的边缘。
In a recent survey by the IWMF and TrollBusters, one-third of respondents said that they had considered abandoning journalism; those at earlier stages in their careers were twice as likely to say that they were considering work in other fields because of the threats and attacks they received, in person or online.	在一项IWMF和TrollBusters进行的最新调查中，三分之一的受访者说她们考虑过离开新闻业；处于职业生涯初期的人因为受到威胁和攻击（包括人身攻击和在线攻击）而考虑换行的可能性要高出一倍。
Despite the obstacles they face, more women appear to be rising in the ranks of the global media industry, even though progress is relatively slow.	尽管面临着这些障碍，但更多的女性正在攀升到全球媒体行业的更高职位，虽然进步相对较慢。
In digital newsrooms, which often have fewer of the inherent inequities of legacy media, the number of women in leadership positions appears to be growing faster.	数字新闻行业的固有不平等性较之传统媒体更低，获得领导岗位的女性数量增长得更快。
However, the “bro” culture in certain newer newsrooms carries its own sexual harassment risks for women.	但是，一些较新的新闻媒体的“兄弟”文化给女性带来了新的性骚扰风险。
Meanwhile, in the United States, several high-profile male journalists have lost their jobs in the last year over allegations of inappropriate behavior toward their female colleagues – part of the broader #MeToo movement.	与此同时，在美国，去年有一些身居高位的男记者因为被控对女同事有不当行为而丢掉了饭碗。 这些指控是广泛的“米兔 ” （ #MeToo）运动的一部分。
But, overall, newsrooms continue to fail to take seriously the threats female journalists face on the job, both in their own workplaces and in the field.	但总体而言，新闻媒体仍然没有正视女记者所面临的职场威胁 — — 不管是在办公室中还是在外勤。
While newsrooms conduct risk assessment and deployment discussions regarding journalists in the field – where women can be particularly vulnerable to unwelcome advances from male colleagues, contacts, or strangers – they rarely account for the specific threats women face, at least not in a sufficiently nuanced way.	新闻媒体会就外勤记者的风险评估和部署进行讨论 — — 跑外勤的女性尤其容易受到来自男同事、线人或陌生人指使不喜欢的工作 — — 他们几乎不会考虑女性所面临的特殊威胁，至少不会充分细致地考虑。
This may be partly because, for major news organizations, these assessments are often handled in consultation with safety advisers – usually former military men, who may not fully appreciate the particular risks women face.	部分原因也许在于，对主要新闻组织而言，这些评估通常是根据安全顾问的意见进行的 — — 这些安全顾问往往是男性退伍军人，未必能充分理解女性所面临的特殊风险。
Sometimes, the safety advisers turn out to be perpetrators of sexual harassment.	有时，安全顾问也会成为性骚扰的施害者。
Anecdotally, I know of several journalists who have been sexually harassed by safety advisers.	我就知道一些传言，有记者被安全顾问性骚扰。
Depending on where this takes place, such behavior can have significant security implications.	取决于这些骚扰所发生的地点，它们可能造成重大安全隐患。
As if that were not enough pressure, female foreign correspondents who are assaulted in the field often find themselves at the center of debates about whether women should be deployed on certain stories at all.	雪上加霜的是，在出外勤时遭到攻击的外国记者，常常会发现自己成为应不应该让女性负责报道某些新闻的争论的核心。
Male correspondents are never the subjects of such debates.	男记者永远不会成为这些争论的对象。
This macho myopia reinforces the damaging imbalance in perspectives shaping the media. It also carries significant economic costs.	这一大男子主义近视强化了影响媒体的失衡，也造成了巨大的经济成本。
As the Harvard Business Review put it, “we all pay the price” when sexual harassment continues or is covered up.	《哈佛商业评论》指出，当性骚扰不断或被掩盖时 ， “ 我们都要付出代价 。 ”
By impeding women from advancing within the industry or compelling them to change jobs, harassment diminishes their earning potential and deprives society of the best use of its talents.	性骚扰阻挠女性在业内获得晋升或迫使她们换工作，拖累了她们的薪酬潜力，也让社会无从最好地利用人才。
The fact is that journalists of various genders, ethnicities, and backgrounds experience different environments differently, in terms of both the risks they face and the rewards they can reap.	事实上，不同性别、种族和背景的记者，能以不同的方式体验不同的环境，包括他们所面临的风险和能够获得的奖励。
Any assessment of a story needs to account for that nuance, with managers choosing the best journalist for the job – and providing the support needed to keep all journalists safe.	对报道的评估都必须考虑到这一细节，管理者要为任务遴选最佳记者 — — 并提供需要的支持保证所有记者安全。
To change the organizational culture that has enabled harassment and other forms of abuse against women – a moral obligation, as well as a legal and economic imperative – newsroom managers must lead from the top.	要改变让女性饱受骚扰和其他形式的暴力的组织文化 — — 这既是道德义务，也是法律和经济当务之急 — — 新闻组织管理者必须起到领导作用。
Change will not happen overnight, nor will it be driven by a single actor.	变化不会一夜之间发生，也不会由某个人以一己之力推动。
Leaders should listen to the women in their ranks, and invite diverse perspectives to help effect change.	领导者必须倾听女下属的声音，吸收多样化的视角来推动有效的变化。
The goal is not to pit young against old or women against men.	目标不是爱惜年轻人或怜香惜玉。
It is to rectify the media industry’s failure to protect its most vulnerable workers.	而是纠正媒体行业无法保护最脆弱员工的状况。
We all pay when that failure prevents women journalists from achieving their full potential.	当这方面的失败阻挠女记者充分实现潜力时，我们所有人都会付出代价。
	
It’s Time to Let Women Thrive	是时候让女性繁荣
DAVOS – In public debates around the world, women’s empowerment is increasingly being recognized as a top priority.	达沃斯 — — 在世界各地的公开辩论中，女性授权越来越被认为是重中之重。
The question of how to provide more economic opportunities for women is firmly on the agenda at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos this year.	今年在达沃斯召开的世界经济论坛年会上，如何为女性提供更多经济机会已经牢牢地登上了议事日程。
And longtime advocates for women are feeling energized, as countless others – men and women alike – have come to recognize the urgency of the task.	女性权利的长期倡导者正在感受到这种活力，因为无数其他人 — — 无论男女 — — 都已经开始认识到这项任务的紧迫性。
Affording women and girls the opportunity to succeed is not just the right thing to do; it can also transform societies and economies for the good of all.	为妇女和女童提供成功的机遇不仅是对的；它还可以改造经济和社会，让所有人都过上更好的生活。
For example, bringing women’s labor force participation up to the same level as that of men would boost GDP by as much as 9% in Japan and 27% in India.	例如，将女性参与劳动的比率提高到与男性同等水平能使日本国内生产总值增长高达9 % ， 印度则可以增长27%之多。
The International Monetary Fund has documented many other macroeconomic benefits associated with women’s empowerment.	国际货币基金组织已经记录了与女性授权相关的其他许多宏观经济好处。
Reducing gender gaps in employment and education has been shown to help economies diversify their exports.	事实证明缩小就业和教育方面的性别差距有助于经济体实现出口多样化。
Appointing more women to banking-supervision boards can prevent cozy groupthink, thereby ensuring greater stability and resilience in the financial sector.	任命更多女性加入银行监管委员会可以防止惬意的团体思维，进而确保金融部门的弹性和稳定。
And reducing gender inequalities also reduces income inequality, allowing for more sustainable growth.	降低性别不平等还可以降低收入不平等，从而使经济增长更可持续。
Closing the gender gap may seem like a tall order, but it is essential for long-term economic development and prosperity.	缩小性别差距可能看似一项很难完成的任务，但却对长期经济发展和繁荣至关重要。
The challenge for every country, then, is to make the most of all of its people’s talents.	因此，充分发挥民众的能力是各国所面临的难题。
Realizing women’s potential is a universal mission.	充分发挥妇女潜力是一项普遍的使命。
But some of the barriers holding women back are also universal.	但阻止妇女进步的某些障碍同样具有普遍性。
Astonishingly, almost 90% of countries have one or more gender-based legal restrictions on the books.	令人惊讶的是， 近90%的国家都有至少一项以性别为基础的法律限制。
In some countries, women still have limited property rights compared to men; in others, husbands have the right to forbid their wives from working.	在某些国家，与男性相比女性的财产权依然有限；而在另外一些国家，丈夫则有权禁止妻子外出工作。
Beyond legal barriers, women also face social and cultural obstacles that limit their access to education, work, and finance.	除法律障碍外，女性还面临社会及文化障碍，限制她们接受教育、获得融资和外出工作。
This is especially true in countries with fragile political systems.	政治制度脆弱的国家尤其是这样。
Now that public awareness of is growing, it is time to press ahead with concrete measures to help women remain in the workforce while raising a family.	现在公众意识不断增强，是时候全力推行具体政策，协助女性在养家糊口的同时继续留在劳动力市场。
For a glimpse of what that might look like, consider Norway, where affordable childcare and parental-leave schemes have proven successful in enabling both mothers and fathers to work.	只需以挪威为例就可以了解可能的状况，那里廉价的儿童保育和育儿假计划已经证明使父母双方同时加入劳动力队伍可以做到。
Yes, these programs are costly.	没错，这样的计划非常昂贵。
But they are well worth the investment, given employed women’s enormous contribution to economic growth.	但鉴于就业妇女对经济增长作出的巨大贡献，这样的投资非常值得。
Moreover, programs that help women keep working also change the role of fathers.	此外，协助女性继续工作的计划同样也改变了父亲的角色。
In Norway and other countries with similar policies, fathers now share equally in parental leave and child-rearing.	在挪威和其他实行类似政策的国家，父亲现在平等地享受育儿假并承担抚养子女的义务。
As a result, more women can pursue leadership roles in work and public life.	因此，更多女性可以在工作和公共生活中发挥领导作用。
Of course, countries that are not yet at Norway’s level of economic development typically face other gender-related challenges, including limited access to water and education.	当然，经济发展水平尚不能与挪威相媲美的国家往往面临着与性别有关的其他挑战，包括获得的饮用水和教育机会不足。
Unfortunately, while many countries have made progress in reducing gender gaps in primary-school enrollment, there is still much more work to be done at the secondary and tertiary levels. As long as these gaps persist, women will not be able to aspire to political and economic power on an equal footing with men.	令人遗憾的是，虽然许多国家在缩小小学入学率差距方面已经取得了进展，但在中学和大学层面还有许多工作要做。
Accordingly, Norway has made girls’ education a top priority in its international-development programs.	只要这些差距依然存在，妇女就无法追求与男性同等的政治和经济权力。
Beyond education, ensuring that women in developing countries have access to finance is critical, because it enables them to participate fully in the economy, including as entrepreneurs.	除教育外，确保发展中国家女性融资权至关重要，因为这能使她们充分参与经济，包括成为企业家。
When women are empowered to start their own businesses, they can drive innovation and help their countries prosper.	当妇女有权开办企业时，她们就可以推动创新并协助国家实现繁荣。
Because women’s labor-force participation is so important for growth, organizations such as the IMF are committed to working with governments around the world to empower women economically.	因为女性劳动力对经济增长尤为重要，像国际货币基金组织这样的机构正致力于与世界各国政府合作，实现在经济领域为女性授权的目标。
IMF-supported programs in Egypt and Jordan, for example, include measures to boost investment in public nurseries and safe public transportation.	例如，国际货币基金组织在埃及和约旦支持的项目包括加大对公共托儿所和安全公共交通的投资力度。
In addition to specific policies, today’s conversation has increasingly focused on the need for wider social change.	除具体政策外，今天的对话越来越关注对大范围社会变革的需求。
And now that movements such as #Equalpay and #MeToo have gained so much momentum, it looks like that change could be coming.	而现在像#薪酬平等和#我也是这样的运动已经引发了如此大的反响，看起来这样的变化可能即将到来了。
It has been inspiring to see so many women, girls, and – yes – men speaking out against retrograde attitudes toward women, which have been holding all of us back.	看到这么多妇女、女童 — — 还有男性 — — 公然抨击对女性的落后态度确实令人鼓舞，因为这样的态度一直在阻止我们发展进步。
With the global economy recovering, governments must now lay the foundation for long-term growth, by creating the conditions for women everywhere to realize their full potential.	随着全球经济复苏，各国政府现在必须通过为各国妇女充分发挥潜能创造条件，从而为长期经济增长奠定基础。
Discrimination and abuse against women can no longer stand.	对妇女的歧视和虐待决不能继续存在。
It is time for women to thrive.	现在是时候让妇女实现繁荣。
	
Women on Top?	女子掌权?
What will G-8 summit meetings be like when American President Hillary Clinton and French President Ségolène Royal join German Chancellor Angela Merkel in a formidable triangle of women’s power?	如果美国总统希拉里·克林顿，法国总统塞格琳·罗雅尔以及德国总理默克尔这样一个令人生畏的女性领导铁三角聚首在八国峰会上会是怎样一种景象？
The scenario is not altogether unlikely.	这种情况的出现并不是完全不可能的。
Indeed, in the United States and France, there are even alternative female candidates for the presidency (Condoleezza Rice in America, Michelle Alliot-Marie in France).	事实上，在美国和法国，甚至还有另外一些女性的总统候选人，美国有赖斯，法国有阿里奥马里 。
Will this mean a new style of both domestic politics and international relations?	这会不会意味着国内政治和国际关系的一种新模式呢？
The answer is not obvious.	答案是并不明显。
After all, some women have long had the strength and the will to make it to the top. Think of Indira Gandhi, Golda Meir, or Margaret Thatcher.	不管怎样，一些女人早就拥有了实力以及问鼎的意志力，比如英迪拉·甘地，梅厄或者撒切尔夫人。
All three were powerful prime ministers of their countries, though perhaps not the epitome of what might be regarded as feminine values.	这三个人都成了她们国家强有力的总理，尽管这也许不能被看作是女权主义价值的一个缩影。
They all outdid men at their own game and had little time for what came to be called feminism.	她们在她们各自的竞赛中都战胜了男人，但是却很少有时间去关注所谓的争取女权运动。
Indeed, another trend may be more significant as far as political leadership is concerned.	毫无疑问，世界上许多地方政治领导的模式正在发生转变。
When it comes to the formation of governments, women have managed to break out of the prison of their traditional domains, such as education and social affairs.	当政府组建时，妇女已经能够打破其传统领域，例如教育和社会事务的束缚。
Foreign policy in particular has become a female aspiration.	特别是，外交已经成为女性的向往。
Both the US and the European Union have women leading their foreign offices; so do half a dozen EU countries, including Britain.	美国和欧盟都是由妇女来掌管外交；其他众多欧盟国家也是如此，包括英国。
Has this changed the style, indeed, the substance of foreign policy?	这是否改变了外交的风格，还是外交的实质？
Undoubtedly, a shift in policy styles is occurring in many parts of the world.	毫无疑问，在世界许多地方正在发生政策风格的转变。
In a word, it appears that the Reagan-Thatcher period is over.	简单地说，看上去里根-撒切尔的时代已经过去了。
While opponents of globalization still fight “neo-liberal” policies, political discourse has taken a new turn.	当全球化的反对者还在与“新自由主义”的政策抗争之时，政治演讲的口气已经转向了一个新的方向。
Words like “justice” are back in fashion; there is concern about globalization’s losers and the “underclass.”	像“公正”这样的词汇有重新成为了时尚；而对于全球化的失败者以及“下层社会”的人也有了更多的关切。
Likewise, the leader of Britain’s Conservatives, David Cameron, startled more old-fashioned supporters of his party by saying that people released from prison “need, above all, love.”	同样地，英国保守党领袖卡梅隆所谓从监狱里释放出来的人“最需要的是爱”的说法震动了他的党内更为古派的支持者。
When Prime Minister Tony Blair described the next election as a fistfight in which the “flyweight” Cameron would be carried out and the “heavyweight” Brown victorious after a short bout, he got much applause from his supporters in the House of Commons, but the remark went down badly with voters.	当布莱尔首相把下一次大选描述为一场拳击比赛 ， “ 轻量级”的卡梅隆会在一个很短的回合后就被“重量级”的布朗轻松击败，他博得了他在下院的支持者巨大的欢呼，然而这种说法并没有被选民所接受。
Somehow, people prefer “softer” values than were prevalent in the last two decades.	就某种程度上讲，人们现在比过去二十年来更倾向于“软”价值。
Yet it is not the leading women who above all represent these values.	然而并不是那些处于领导地位的女性最主要地代表了这些价值。
Merkel may have been softened by having to preside over a grand coalition, but her original stance was more of the Reagan-Thatcher variety.	默克尔也许在建立一个大联合政府时会有所软化，但是她最初的立场更多地是里根-撒切尔类型的。
Yuliya Tymoshenko was clearly the most stouthearted among the leaders of Ukraine’s Orange Revolution, and no one has ever described Hillary Clinton as particularly “soft.”	季莫申科显然是乌克兰橙色革命的领导人中最勇敢的一位，同样从来没有人把希拉里·克林顿描述为一个特别“软”的人。
On the contrary, her possible Republican opponent in 2009, Senator John McCain, while a war hero, is also a man who represents to many Americans the new soft values.	恰恰相反，可能在2009年成为她的共和党对手的参议员麦凯恩作为一个战争英雄，在许多美国人眼里却代表了新的软价值。
Merkel had a difficult time in the run-up to her recent party conference, because Jürgen Rüttgers, the minister-president of the largest German state, North-Rhine Westphalia, reminded the Christian Democrats of their historical support for strong social-welfare policies.	默克尔在她前一次的党代会上走上前台也是颇费了一番周折，因为德国最大的州北莱茵-威斯特法伦州的州长约尔根·吕特格尔斯提醒基督教民主党注意他们在历史上一贯支持强有力的社会福利政策。
Only Royal may be said to represent softer lines against the hard-liner of the governing party, Nicolas Sarkozy.	只有罗耶尔相对于执政党的代表萨尔科齐的强硬路线而言可能代表了软的价值。
So, have women at or near the top made no real difference to politics?	那么，女性当权真的在政治上没有带来任何变化吗？
Whatever change they have brought has not been obvious.	至少这种变化并不明显。
In a sense, women’s advance is simply the normal consequence of the gradual move to effective equality of opportunity that began in the 1960’s.	某种程度上讲，女性所取得的进展只不过是二十世纪六十年代慢慢开始形成的给予男性和女性平等机会的运动的一个正常结果。
It took decades to become real, and there are still countries that have a long way to go.	这个目标花了几十年时间才变成现实，但是依然还有一些国家距离实现这一目标还有很长的道路要走。
Despite Tymoshenko’s leading role in Ukraine, it would be surprising to see Russian President Vladimir Putin replaced by a woman, and, while there is a female vice-president in China, there is no sign of a woman becoming Japanese prime minister soon.	尽管季莫申科在乌克兰处于领导角色，但是如果俄罗斯总统普京被一名女性所取代的话那会令人非常惊讶，而尽管中国有一个女性的副总理，但是没有迹象表明日本会很快出现一名女首相。
Even so, in many parts of the world, women have made considerable headway on the path to the top.	尽管如此，在世界上许多地方，女性在走向权力顶峰的路上已经取得了巨大的进步。
Not infrequently this has been helped by explicit policies.	明确的政策在这其中常常帮了很大的忙。
David Cameron prides himself on a successful campaign to make 40% of all Conservative parliamentary candidates in Britain are women.	卡梅隆在一次成功的竞选活动上自豪地称英国40%的保守党议员候选人是女性。
But this is precisely the point.	但是这正是问题所在。
It is not the women at the top who have changed the scene.	并不是处于权力顶峰的女性改变了这一现象。
Rather, it is a more general trend, helped along by open-minded leaders of both sexes, that has changed the political climate in countries.	这更多地是一种整体的趋势，在两种性别的开明的领导人的推动下，改变了许多国家的政治气候。
No one, man or woman, can today aspire to setting the tone of public discourse without recognizing that politics is no longer only a man’s game.	没有一个人，不管是女性还是男性，今天在寻求公开演讲的基调时会不认识到政治已经不再是单单男人的游戏。
In other words, normalization by equal opportunity is itself the change.	换句话说，平等机会的正常化本身就是一种改变。
Whatever the particular values of leading candidates, this is undoubtedly progress.	不管处于领先地位的候选人代表的是哪一种价值观，这毫无疑问就是一种进步。
	
What Boosts Gender Equality in Developing Countries?	什么促进了发展中国家的性别平等？
WASHINGTON, DC – On March 8, the world will celebrate International Women’s Day, an annual opportunity to recommit to gender equality.	华盛顿—3月8日，世界将迎来国际妇女节，这个节日是一年一度的重振性别平等的机会。
This year’s observance comes at an important time for women’s rights, as global movements like #MeToo and #TimesUp are refocusing attention on the discriminatory practices that women confront in their social and professional lives.	今年的三八妇女节正逢妇女权利的重要时刻 ， “ 我也是 ” （ #MeToo）和“抓紧时间 ” （ #TimesUp）等全球运动正在让人们的注意力重新集中于妇女在社会和职场生活中所遇到的歧视型对待上。
But while women in the developed world are waging big battles over gender bias, women and girls in developing countries remain focused on smaller victories.	但是，尽管发达世界妇女向性别偏见发动了更大规模的进攻，但发展中国家的妇女和女童仍然着眼于小胜利。
On this International Women’s Day, we must not forget that in the world’s poorest communities, poverty, hunger, domestic violence, and discrimination remain endemic obstacles to gender parity.	在这个国际妇女节，我们切不可忘记在全球最贫穷的社会里，贫困、饥饿、家庭暴力和歧视仍是阻碍性别平等的巨大障碍。
I have studied gender and development in the Global South for 15 years.	我在全球南方研究性别和发展问题有15年之久。
My research, which has included thousands of interviews with women from India to Burkina Faso, has centered on one question: How can the international community improve the welfare of the world’s poorest women?	在研究过程中，我访问过来自从印度到布基纳法索的数千名妇女，主要话题集中在一个问题上：国际社会如何改善世界最贫穷妇女的福利？
The answer, it turns out, is to help them do what they are already doing on their own.	答案是帮助她们从事她们自己已经在做的事。
One of the most effective ways to empower women anywhere, but especially in the developing world, is by promoting financial independence.	不论在什么地区（尤其是发展中世界 ） ， 妇女赋权最有效的方法之一是促进财务独立。
In many areas, that means supporting “informal savings groups,” networks of like-minded women who pay dues to build a shared pool of resources.	在很多地区，这意味着支持“非正式储蓄组织 ” ， 即由意气相投的妇女组成一个网络，共同出资形成一个共享资源池。
This money can then be drawn on to fund any number of items, such as small business expenses, school fees, or health-care costs.	这笔资金可以用来支持一切项目，比如小笔商务支出、学费、医药费等。
Community-based savings groups – there are millions in Asia and Africa alone – are changing lives every day.	基于社区的储蓄组织 — — 光是在亚洲和非洲，这种组织就有数百万之多 — — 正在改变日常生活。
I once met a woman in Burkina Faso whose son owes his life to the financial resources of a savings network.	我曾经在布基纳法索遇见一位妇女，靠储蓄网络的金融资源救了自己儿子的性命。
One evening, when the boy was violently ill with diarrhea, his mother called a taxi to take him to the nearest clinic.	一天晚上，她的儿子剧烈腹泻，她叫了一辆出租车把他送到最近的诊所。
But taxis, like ambulances, must be paid for in advance, and the woman had no money.	但出租车和救护车一样，必须先付钱才提供服务，但她没有钱。
Fortunately, a neighbor who belonged to a health savings group was able to contribute and pay the fare.	幸运的是，一位参加了一个医疗储蓄组织的邻居能够慷慨解囊。
That immediate access to cash very likely saved the boy’s life.	立即能够获得现金很有可能是她的儿子能够活下来的主要原因。
Most savings group loans are similarly small.	大部分储蓄组织贷款都是类似的小额贷款。
In Benin, for example, the average loan size in one group is just $9.	比如，在贝宁，一个组织的平均贷款规模只有9美元。
But, in a country where the average annual income is less than $800, small amounts can make a huge difference.	但贝宁平均年收入不到800美元，一小笔钱就可以造成巨大的不同。
Unfortunately, many savings groups, as important as they are, do not scale; most operate in isolation from official services, which weakens their effectiveness.	不幸的是，许多储蓄组织尽管十分重要，却没有实现规模；大部分此类组织脱离官方服务运转，这削弱了它们的效果。
Women in poor communities must rely on one another, but they also need access to government and international agencies if they are ever to escape from hunger and poverty.	贫穷社会的妇女必须“抱团取暖 ” ， 但要摆脱饥饿和贫困，她们还需要政府和国际机构的帮助。
That is why my organization, the Grameen Foundation, is using digital technology and mobile phones to connect savings groups with other service providers.	因此，我的组织格雷米恩基金会（Grameen Foundation）运用数字技术和移动电话将储蓄组织和其他服务提供者联系在一起。
One of our largest projects is in Burkina Faso, a desperately poor country in West Africa where an estimated 55% of the population is food insecure for at least a portion of the year.	我们最大的项目之一在布基纳法索。 这是一个位于西非的极端贫穷国家，大约55%的人口一年总有一段时间口粮得不到保证。
Since 1993, we have worked with more than 73,000 women in nearly 3,300 savings groups, bringing services directly to the women who need them.	自1993年以来，我们与近3,300个储蓄组织的73,000多位妇女进行了合作，为需要它们的妇女直接提供服务。
Our average participant is 40 years old, illiterate, and earns just $7 a week selling crops like sesame and peanut.	总体而言，我们的参与者平均年龄为40岁，文化程度为文盲，依靠出售芝麻和花生等农作物为生，每周只能挣7美元。
When we began the program, only about half of the women we worked with said they felt empowered in their homes; many feared their husbands.	项目启动时，只有大约一半的参与妇女说感到在家里有得到赋权的感觉；许多人都害怕自己的丈夫。
Today, those sentiments are slowly changing.	如今，这些情绪正在慢慢改变。
By serving as a bridge between informal savings groups and banks, health centers, schools, and agricultural extension services, we are helping women make better decisions about food use, nutritional practices, and spending.	我们充当了一座连接非正式储蓄组织与银行、医疗中心、学校和农技服务之间的桥梁，帮助妇女做出有关粮食使用、营养和支出的更好的决策。
Our goal is to reduce poverty rates by strengthening asset-management skills, which would give women a greater voice in their communities.	我们的目标是通过加强资产管理技能让妇女在社区中发出更响亮的声音，从而降低贫困率。
“Gender dialogue sessions” that we host are also strengthening family bonds.	我们主办的“性别对话大会”还加强了家庭关系。
During each of my field visits, I have been amazed at how these efforts are affecting women’s lives.	在每一次实地访问中，我都会对这些措施如何影响妇女生活感到高兴。
On one recent trip, I met Rasmata, a young mother who told me that thanks to the safety net of her savings group, she was managing to support her family despite her husband’s emigration abroad, her father’s recent death, and a lingering drought.	在一次最近的访问中，我遇到了一位名叫拉斯马塔（Rasmata）的年轻母亲，他告诉我，在她的储蓄组织所提供的安全网的支持下，她得以在丈夫移居海外、父亲去世、干旱持续不退的情况下养活全家。
She was diversifying her income, managing her finances, and even adopting climate-smart farming techniques.	她正在设法实现收入多样化，进行财务管理，甚至用上了气候智能农作技术。
The best part was that she described herself as a “hard-working, respectful, rigorous, and ambitious woman.”	最令人欣喜的是，她自我定位为一个“努力工作、有礼貌、严格、有进取心的妇女 ” 。
Those are adjectives that women everywhere, regardless of their financial situation or education, deserve to ascribe to themselves.	不管身居何处、财务状况和教育程度如何，所有妇女都应该这样自我定位。
So this week, as the world celebrates the incredible progress that women have made on the long march to parity, I will be thinking about women like Rasmata, who have accomplished so much despite having so little.	因此，在本周全世界庆祝妇女在通往平等的漫漫征途上所取得的巨大进步时，我会想到像拉斯马塔这样的妇女，她们几乎一无所有，但取得了如此不凡的成就。
	
The Myth of the Women’s Vote	女性选票传说
WASHINGTON, DC – Among the clichés that deserve to be thrown out after the recent presidential election in the United States is the idea of a “women’s vote.”	华盛顿—在应该从最近的美国总统大选中消灭的糟粕中，有一个是“女性选票”的概念。
It may seem surprising that only 54% of the female electorate voted for Hillary Clinton, the first woman nominated for president by a major party.	看起来好像很奇怪，只有54%的女选民把票投给了历史上第一位主要政党总统提名人希拉里·克林顿。
But while gender is a strong marker for how Americans think about certain issues, it is not the best predictor of how they will vote.	然而，尽管性别是美国人看待某些问题的重要标记，但它并非如何投票的最佳指标。
It turns out that female candidates do not face a single gender gap, but rather multiple gender gaps.	看起来，女候选人面临的不是单一性别差距，而是多重性别差距。
To be sure, a superficial look at past election results reveals an enormous and persistent difference between men and women voters overall.	诚然，肤浅地研究过去的选举结果表明，男性和女性选民之间总体而言存在巨大且持久的差异。
According to Pew Research, the last presidential election in which men and women voted the same was the 1976 contest between Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford.	据皮尤研究公司（Pew Research ） ， 最近一次男性和女性选民投票结果相同的总统选举时1976年吉米·卡特与杰拉德·福特之间的竞争。
In this year’s election, women favored Clinton by 12 percentage points, and men favored Trump by the same margin.	在今年的选举中，女性以12个百分点的优势更支持克林顿，而男性以同样的优势更支持特朗普。
Men favored George W. Bush by 11 points in 2000, and women favored Obama by 13 points and 11 points in 2008 and 2012, respectively; but until now we have never seen double-digit gaps in both directions simultaneously.	2000年，男性支持小布什的优势为11个百分点，2008年和2012年，女性支持奥巴马的优势分别为13和11个百分点；但到目前为止，我们从未发现两个方向同时出现两位数差距。
But this still does not mean that the gender gap tells us much as a first-order factor, especially if we consider other gaps among demographic groups.	但这仍然不意味着性别差距可以作为第一等因素，特别是如果我们考虑人群之间的其他差距的话。
If we sort by race or ethnicity, we find that white Americans favored Trump by 21 points, while Hispanics and African-Americans favored Clinton by 36 points and 80 points, respectively.	如果我们用种族或民族分类，就会发现美国白人支持特朗普的优势为21个百分点，而西班牙裔和非洲裔美国人支持克林顿的优势分别为36和80个百分点。
Meanwhile, voters with different education levels were further apart than in any election since 1980.	与此同时，不同教育水平的选民之间的分歧为1980年以来之最。
College-educated voters backed Clinton by a nine-point margin, while people without a college degree backed Trump by an eight-point margin.	具有大学文化的选民以九个百分点的优势支持克林顿，而没有大学文凭的选民支持特朗普的优势为八个百分点。
A New York Times analysis of exit polls found that voters with annual incomes below $50,000 backed Clinton by about a ten-point margin, while voters with incomes above that level split evenly between the two candidates.	《纽约时报》的口民调分析发现，年收入50,000美元以下的选民以十个百分点的优势支持克林顿，而年收入50,000美元以上的选民对两位候选人的支持不分伯仲。
This indicates that, at least in this year’s election, ethnicity and education were much more predictive than income.	这表明，至少在今年的选举中，种族和教育比收入更有预测意义。
As it happens, they were also more predictive than gender.	是的，它们也比性别更具有预测意义。
Ninety-three percent of African-American women and 80% of African-American men voted for Clinton.	百分之九十三的非洲裔女性和80%的非洲裔男性把票投给了克林顿。
But 53% of white women and 63% of white men voted for Trump, while only 43% of white women and 31% of white men voted for Clinton.	但53%的白人女性和63的白人男性支持特朗普，而只有43%的白人女性和31的白人男性把票投给了克林顿。
Similarly, Clinton won the support of white, college-educated women by six points; but she lost white non-college-educated women by 28 points and white non-college-educated men by 49 points.	类似地，克林顿以六个百分点的优势赢得受过大学教育的白人女性的支持，但她在未上过大学的白人女性上输掉了28个百分点，在未上过大学的白人男性上输掉了49个百分点。
And if we look just at Republican voters, the gender gap vanishes almost entirely: 91% of Republican women and 92% of Republican men voted for Trump.	而如果我们只看共和党选民，性别差距几乎完全消失：91%的共和党女性和92%的共和党男性把票投给了特朗普。
This all points not to a single gender dynamic, but to one refracted through multiple social and economic lenses.	所有这些都不支持单一的性别动态，而指向多重社会和经济滤镜的深度折射。
For example, as CBS News noted, Clinton’s failure to match President Barack Obama’s performance with African-American voters was “entirely due to black men” not voting for her – though why this was the case remains unexplained.	比如，CBS新闻台指出，克林顿没有取得奥巴马总统在非洲裔选民中的表现“完全可以归因于黑人男性”没有投票给她 — — 尽管为什么会这样没有得到解释。
And, despite her candidacy’s historic significance, Clinton’s performance with white women voters was no better than Obama’s performance in 2012.	此外，尽管她在提名竞争中取得空前大胜，但克林顿在白人女选民中的表现并未优于2012年的奥巴马。
We know that Republican women voted according to their party affiliation and not their gender.	我们知道，共和党女性投票是根据政党属性，而不是性别。
But Trump also seems to have reached white women not affiliated with a political party, perhaps owing to his campaign’s strategy of hyping women’s anxiety.	但特朗普似乎也赢得了不属于某个正当的白人女性，也许这是因为他的竞选战略直击女性的焦虑点。
This strategy’s success indicates one way that gender can play a role in voter decision-making.	这一战略的成功表明，性别在某种程度上可以影响投票决策。
Voter data going back 50 years suggests that women, more than men, are moved by the anxiety of changing circumstances and external threats.	回溯50年的选民数据表明，女性比男性更受环境变化和外部威胁所带来的焦虑的驱动。
For example, in the 1964 presidential election, Lyndon B. Johnson’s campaign aired the now-famous “Daisy” advertisement that suggested that his opponent, Barry Goldwater, would pull the US into a nuclear war; a week later, polls found that 45% of men, but 53% of women, shared that concern.	比如，在1964年的总统选举中，林登·约翰逊竞选班子制作了如今大名鼎鼎的“黛西”广告，暗示他的对手巴里·戈德华特（Barry Goldwater）将把美国拖入核战争；一周后，民调显示45%的男性表示感同身受，但女性的这一比例达到了53 % 。
Similarly, George W. Bush performed 30% better with women voters in his 2004 re-election campaign than he did in his 2000 campaign, which many political analysts attribute to anxieties among white middle-class “security moms” in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.	类似地，小布什在2004年的连任选战中的女性选民表现比2000年更好，许多政治分析家将此归因于白人中产阶级“安全妈妈”因为2001年9月11日的恐怖袭击而引起焦虑。
Still more recently, in the 2014 US midterm elections, Republicans emphasized the US’s vulnerabilities, and aired advertisements hinting that the Islamic State was directing Ebola-infected agents to kill Americans.	更近一些的2014年美国中期选举中，共和党强调美国的弱点，并制作广告暗示伊斯兰国派出感染埃博拉病毒的特工杀死美国人。
Experts ridiculed these claims, but polling suggests that the advertisements were nevertheless effective, and a number of Democratic incumbents, and women in particular, lost elections that year.	专家对这样的宣传嗤之以鼻，但民调显示这些广告是有效的，而在那一年的选举中，许多民主党在任者 — — 特别是女性 — — 败走麦城。
The Democrats’ focus on reproductive rights had done little to sway women who were already worrying about the Islamic State and Ebola.	民主党对生育权的强调几乎无法动摇已经开始担忧伊斯兰国和埃博拉的女性。
As I warned at the time, the 2014 election was a trial run for a 2016 strategy to defeat a woman candidate.	当时我警告说，2014年选举是2016年击败女性候选人策略的试验场。
Many political observers assumed that this strategy could not possibly work for a Republican candidate who had suggested that a debate moderator was menstruating, joked about dating his daughter, was caught on tape boasting about groping women, and was publicly accused by several women of sexual harassment and assault.	许多政治观察家认为这一策略对于一位表示电视辩论主持人来“大姨妈 ” 、 打趣约会他女儿、吹嘘“咸猪手”被人拍下、被多位女性公开谴责性骚扰的共和党候选人来说根本没有作用。
But, just as in the 2014 election, Republican-leaning voters in 2016 were far more concerned about terrorism, crime, illegal immigration, and economic security than they were about issues such as sexism, racism, and inequality.	但是，一如2014年选举，2016年倾向于共和党的选民更加担心的是恐怖主义、犯罪、非法移民和经济安全，而不是性别歧视、种族主义和不平等性等问题。
Where does this leave American women?	这对美国女性意味着什么？
A female US presidential candidate has now won a majority of women’s votes, and more total votes than her male opponent, and yet her strategy failed to deliver enough votes to secure a victory.	一位女美国总统候选人赢得了多数女性选票，总票数也多于她的男性对手，但她的策略没有吸引足够选票以保证胜利。
In America’s polarized political culture, appeals to one group simply alienate other groups.	在极化的美国政治文化中，吸引一个群体等于疏远其他群体。
As long as female candidates are forced to meet multiple, contradictory gender expectations, the US will never close the most prominent gap of all: that between America and the many countries that have already chosen a woman to lead them.	美国永远无法填补最显眼的差距：美国和许多已经选择女性来领导他们的许多国家之间差距。
	
Making “Women’s Work” Count	让“女性的工作”创造价值
ISTANBUL – Over the next few months, the 12,000 employees based at Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California will complete their move to an extravagant new campus.	伊斯坦布尔 — — 接下来的几个月，加利福尼亚州库比蒂诺市苹果总部的12,000名员工将要完成向豪华新址的搬迁工作。
The “spaceship,” covering 2.8 million square feet, includes a two-story yoga studio, running paths, and even revolutionary pizza boxes that keep slices crisp.	占地280万平方英尺的新址“宇宙飞船”包括一座两层的瑜伽工作室、跑道甚至是能保持比萨饼酥脆的革命性的比萨盒。
One thing it does not have, however, is daycare.	但新址却没有日间托儿所。
When it comes to ignoring the importance of childcare for working parents, Apple is far from unique.	在无视托儿工作对职业父母的重要性方面，苹果绝不是独一无二的。
And that omission places a powerful drag on parents’ ability to achieve their economic potential, with women suffering the most.	这样的忽视对父母发挥其经济潜力造成了巨大的拖累，其中尤以女性受损最多。
Worldwide, women carry out twice as much unpaid domestic and care work – including raising children, caring for sick or elderly family members, and managing the household – as men do.	世界范围内，女性所从事的不计薪酬的家务和护理工作是男性的两倍 — — 其中包括抚养子女、照顾患病或年老的家庭成员，以及承担家庭管理工作。
In Mexico, India, and Turkey, women do three times more care work than men.	在墨西哥、印度和土耳其，女性承担了超过男性三倍的护理工作。
This “gender chore gap” limits women’s choices, as it impedes their ability to obtain formal education, secure good jobs, and achieve equal pay.	这样的“性别家务差距”限制了女性的选择，因为它导致女性无法接受正规教育、寻找良好工作并获取同等报酬。
Indeed, though women around the world actually work more than men in total (including both paid and unpaid work), they earn one quarter less, on average, hold only one quarter of executive positions in the private sector, and occupy less than one quarter of all seats in national parliaments.	事实上，尽管全世界的女性实际付出的劳动多于男性（包括付费及无偿劳动 ） ， 但她们的平均收入却比男性低1/4，仅仅占据1/4的私营部门管理岗位，并且在全部国家议会席位中仅占不到1/4的份额。
Only half of working-age women worldwide are in the paid labor force, compared to more than three quarters of men.	全世界仅半数工作年龄女性参与有偿劳动，而男性这一比例则超过3/4。
This situation is slowly beginning to change.	这种情况正在慢慢发生变化。
Unpaid household and care work is gradually shedding its reputation as “women’s work,” and men today are assuming more household responsibilities than their fathers and grandfathers did.	无偿的家务和护理工作正逐渐褪去“女性工作”的名声，而今天的男性与他们的父辈和祖辈相比正在承担更多的家务职责。
Some countries, particularly in Europe, are revising traditional leave policies so that parents can choose how to allocate time off after the birth of a child.	某些国家，尤其是欧洲国家，正在修改传统的休假政策，以便有孩子的家长可以选择在孩子降生后如何分配休假时间。
More broadly, the value of unpaid household and care work – not just for children and family members, but also for the long-term health of societies and economies – is increasingly being recognized.	更广义地讲，无偿家务和护理工作的价值 — — 不仅针对子女和家庭成员，而且针对长期社会和经济健康 — — 正在越来越多地被人们所认识到。
Efforts to measure the contribution of care work to national economies have produced estimates ranging from 20% to 60% of GDP.	据衡量护理工作对国家经济贡献的项目估计，护理工作创造了20~60%的GDP。
In 2015, United Nations member states adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which call for recognizing, reducing, and redistributing unpaid care work – a measure long proposed by feminist economists and gender-equality advocates.	2015年，联合国成员国通过了可持续发展目标（SDGs ） ， 要求承认、减少和重新分配无偿护理工作 — — 这是一项女权主义经济学家和性别平等倡导者长期以来积极建议的举措。
The question now is what can actually be done to meet this objective.	现在的问题是人们可以为实现这一目标做些什么。
The responsibility will lie, first and foremost, with governments.	责任首先在于政府。
After all, while businesses or neighborhood associations may offer childcare options to working parents, costs and quality vary widely.	归根结底，虽然企业或社区协会可以向职业父母提供育儿选择，但成本和质量差别很大。
Government action is needed to ensure that care services cover all who need them – from preschool children to the sick, the disabled, and the elderly – and that they are universally accessible and affordable.	只有政府采取行动才能确保所有需求者都能得到护理服务 — — 从学龄前儿童到病人、残疾人和老年人 — — 而且这些服务必须经济实惠、随处可得。
Beyond services, however, achieving the SDGs’ targets will require policy change.	不过除服务外，实现可持续发展目标将需要改变政策。
Most important, governments must establish requirements for parental and family leave programs.	最重要的是，政府必须制定家长和家庭假的硬性规则。
Together with private companies, they can also provide monetary incentives for men and women to share household and care work more equally.	政府可以与私营企业合作为平均分担家务和护理工作的男性和女性提供货币奖励。
Such policies have proved effective not only in Northern Europe – the most commonly cited model – but also in Eastern European countries like Lithuania, Estonia, and even Hungary, demonstrating that they can be applied anywhere.	事实证明这样的政策不仅在最常被用作范例的北欧地区有效 — — 而且在立陶宛、爱沙尼亚甚至匈牙利等东欧国家也取得了很好的效果，事实表明这样的政策在地域上是普适的。
At a time when many governments, particularly in the developing world, are faced with severe fiscal constraints, such interventions may seem farfetched.	在许多国家政府，尤其是发展中国家政府，普遍面临严重财政困难的时刻，这样的干预措施或许看起来是不切实际的。
But spending on the care sector should be viewed as an investment, not a cost.	但护理行业的开支应当被视为一种投资，而不是一种代价。
A recent study in Turkey showed that one dollar of public money invested in the care sector could create 2.5 times as many jobs as a dollar invested in the construction industry.	近期土耳其的一项研究表明对护理行业投入一美元的公共资金可以创造建筑业单位投资2.5倍的工作。
More than half of those jobs – decent jobs that could raise incomes and living standards, particularly for poor households – would go to women.	这些工作中有超过半数 — — 这些体面的工作可以提高贫困家庭的收入和生活水平 — — 主要分配给女性求职者。
International institutions can play an important role in helping governments to seize the opportunities presented by investment in the care sector.	国际机构可以在协助政府抓住护理行业投资机遇方面发挥重要的作用。
In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the United Nations Development Programme undertook an initiative that helped women who had mostly worked at home their entire lives to find jobs in the care sector, enabling them to make use of their skills, by caring for children and for young adults with disabilities, while earning an income.	在前南斯拉夫马其顿共和国，联合国开发计划署采取了一项举措，协助多数时间在家工作的妇女在护理行业寻找工作，促使她们能够运用自己的技能，照顾儿童和残疾青年，并同时赚取收入。
As populations grow and age, the care sector will only increase in importance.	随着人口数量和年龄的增长，护理行业的重要性只会不断增加。
Adapting to these new circumstances now will give countries a considerable advantage, as it bolsters women’s rights and freedoms, generates jobs, and make societies more equal.	现在适应这样的新情况将赋予国家相当大的竞争优势，因为它增强了女性的自由和权利、创造了就业机会并且提高了社会的平等度。
So what are we waiting for?	既然如此，我们还在等什么？
	
Worker Protests In China: Plentiful But Preempted	中国的工人抗议：众而不力？
The last annualized figure for labor protests that Beijing was willing to announce publicly was 100,000 for the year 1999.	中国官方愿意公布的上一个关于年度劳工抗议活动的数字是1999年的100000起。 而据公安部2001年的一份内部报告披露，该数字自1997年以来“如疾风般增长 ” 。
	这一年正值以“效率”为名施压让工厂解雇工人的中共十五大召开。
But a 2001 internal report from the Ministry of Public Security disclosed that the numbers "began a rise like a violent wind" from 1997, the year of the Communist Party's Fifteenth Congress, which pressed for factory firings in the name of "efficiency."	虽然中国政府决意对媒体封锁一切可能引发骚动的消息—或至少轻描淡写地报道其规模和破坏性—但我们仍然能够从发生在1994至2004年间的200多次不同事件中收集到信息。 这些事件只是在这期间实际发生而却未被报道的数千起事件的冰山一角。
	这些报道有的来自于香港的媒体，一小部分来自于中国的出版物，还有的来自于西方媒体。
While the government is determined to keep news of all disturbances out of the media--or at least downplay their size and disruptiveness--it has been possible to collect information on nearly 200 separate events occurring between 1994 and 2004, some from news sources in Hong Kong, some from the Western media, and a few from Chinese publications.	这些报道反映了同一种普遍增强之中的模式：各级政府，不论是北京还是地方，一般而言都容忍由手持请愿书和标语的农民和工人参与的，声势和规模较小且非破坏性的游行和静坐。 如果示威者们只是自发、无组织、地方性和无领袖的，政府对其态度则更为宽容。
They all exhibit the same, unchanging pattern: the government, whether in Beijing or the localities, tolerates the low-decibel, smaller-scale, relatively non-disruptive marches and sit-ins by demonstrators bearing petitions and posters, especially if they appear to be spontaneous, un-organized, localized and leaderless.	政治精英层对于那些可能由持不同政见者发动的，带有明显暴力性质的，体现出某种组织性的，以扩大化相威胁的或造成交通主动脉堵塞的动乱则不那么包容了。 的确，在中国大陆之外得以报道的少数事件往往都包含抗议者卧轨或阻塞城市主干道，攻击权力机关或与之发生冲突，拘留和逮捕等因素。
The incidents loom substantially more dangerous to the political elite if they seem to have been mobilized by dissidents, are marked by some measure of violence, threaten to spread, or entail the obstruction of major transport trunklines.	在这么一个通常被描绘为发展日新月异和高度强调“稳定”的国家，是什么在诱发这些不安定因素呢？ 原因是：拖欠工资和养老金；突然和大量地终止劳动合同；造成一些工业企业破产的腐败官员；以及绝大多数从1950年代共产党政权早期就一直得以保证的社会主义权益的终结。
Indeed, the episodes that make it into the media beyond the Mainland are usually such protests.	的确，在许多中国人日渐富裕的同时，失业让许多大城市近八分之一的正式登记居民直接陷入贫困。
What is sparking so much unrest in a country usually depicted as daily growing more affluent?	为了废止被后毛泽东时代的领导人们认为是过度和浪费的社会主义计划经济，自1990年代早期以来就有6000万国有企业职工因工厂效益差而被解雇。
Generally the causes are these: unpaid wages and pensions; sudden and massive job terminations; and management corruption held responsible for the bankruptcy of industrial enterprises--where discharged workers were secure, enjoying privileges and benefits, since the 1950s.	这些国有企业难以为继的原因是缺乏先进的技术和设备，管理不善或资产侵占，沉重的社会福利负担，或是来自国内外更为现代化和更有成本效率的非国有企业的竞争。
Job losses in the range of 60 million have suddenly rendered nearly an eighth of the urban populace indigent. Often without a dependable channel for airing their grievances, hordes of laid-off workers and retired folk have filled the avenues over the past decade or so.	由于没有真正可靠的渠道申诉不平，在过去的十年里，许许多多被解雇的工人和被迫下岗（只拿部分养老金）的工人正向政府发起挑战。
Doesn't the government mind if so much of its urban populace is sinking into poverty and becoming disaffected? Why is this stability-obsessed regime allowing so much instability?	难道这个自我标榜为“人民的”政府不在乎如此之多的城市平民陷入贫困，不满情绪与日俱增吗？
In fact, the leaders are terribly uneasy about the situation and discuss it frequently. Some of the response has been coldly coercive.	为什么这个重视稳定多于一切的政权允许这么多的不稳定因素存在呢？
But there is also a compensatory effort that has absorbed much of the energy of the bureaucracies for labor and social security, and for civil affairs.	事实是，虽然党的领导人们对这样的情况甚为不安并频繁商议对策，但在中国两种制度的过渡时期他们能有所作为的空间是有限的。
For 2004, the central government allocated some 78 billion yuan for laid-off workers and the poor, with localities also upping their outlays. But the sad truth is that probably only about a quarter of those pushed out of their plants ever received assistance.	共产党对“社会不稳定”的危险紧箍咒般的强调，和不遗余力地掌握政权，使得其官员们被迫以有限的手段来应对这些爆发性的不安定的现实及其背后的原因。
For those who have, however, this policy has nipped discontent in the bud.	同时这些动乱也使共产党蒙羞，它本应代表无产阶级的最高利益。
	该党的一些反应是冷酷而具有强制性的。
Additionally, there have been attempts to create new posts, develop labor-intensive industries and small and medium sized firms, promote the private sector, and encourage service jobs, plus offering occupational training: the government allocated an additional 4.7 billion yuan expressly for job creation in 2004.	但它也采取了一些补偿性的措施，让劳动、社会保障和民政部门的官僚们忙得不亦乐乎。 他们都必须为平息社会动荡而划拨数目可观的应急资金。
	其中之一就是“再就业计划 ” （ 自1998年起在全国展开 ） 。
	该计划的一个远大目标就是安置国有企业的下岗职工。
These policies mitigate the pain of job loss for their recipients.	该计划在为下岗职工提供基本的生活费、医疗保险和养老金方面起到了临时管理者的作用。 同时，它也试图为下岗工人寻找新的就业机会或为他们自己创业提供优惠的条件。
Promotion of the law also aims at alleviating anger. As workers' consciousness of their rights increases, they are gradually more and more apt to appeal grievances to the courts: from 1995 to 2001, adjudicated labor disputes rose from 28,000 to 101,000.	实际上，中央政府在2004年共划拨779亿元巨款用于下岗工人和贫困人口，各级地方政府也同时加大了拨款力度。
Offering workers legal redress has turned their attention temporarily from the streets to mediation and may well have reduced the number of street demonstrations.	但悲哀的是可能只有约四分之一的下岗工人曾得到过任何有实际意义的帮助。 而对于那些成千上万未能受惠的工人，这项政策已将他们的不满掐灭在萌芽状态。
Other initiatives are a program of allowances, training and placement for the laid-off; unemployment insurance (which, unfortunately, depends on the economic health of the firm to which a worker was once attached); and pension reform--having similar problems.	随着广大工人的维权意识日渐加强，他们更倾向于向法庭申诉冤情。 的确，在1995至2001年间，法院裁决的劳资纠纷从28000件增加到了101000件。
There is also a scheme to supply a "minimum livelihood guarantee" to the desperately poor.	诚然，工人们时常发现由于受贿和被告的经理人们更大的影响力，仲裁并没有起到多大作用。
Recipients numbered over 20 million as of early 2004, when 15 billion yuan was budgeted for the program (with the central government contributing a full 60%). These programs are noticed at the grassroots, with the indigent feeling grateful for them.	但法律途径至少将一部分心怀不满的工人的注意力暂时从走上街头转移到法律调解，而这就有助于减少对抗性的街头示威。
Protest in China has spun upward dramatically in recent years, in numbers, scale, and organization.	虽然如此，在过去几年里，中国城市抗议活动的数量还是大幅增加，而且据警方的报告称，它们的规模更大也更有组织了。
But by the means listed above the regime has become adept at suppressing opposition.	到目前为止，政府通过控制媒体（从而防止一个抗议运动了解另一个并与之串联 ） ， 通过发放临时津贴安抚失业工人，和镇压及关押不听劝阻的人等方式成功地保持了总体的稳定。
Its power to intimidate and punish may trump all its other moves to stay ahead of the discontent.	然而，与由苛捐杂税、官员腐败和肆意征地引发的农民抗议活动联系起来考量，以上所为也不过是权宜之计。 共产党的领导人们发现自己正面临着一种令他们极为不安的情况。
But overall, increasing responsiveness--if clearly not in a democratic mode--has managed to maintain the instability that does exist at a level and within a scope that marks a game of unwritten rules -- one of complainants confining their choler within understood bounds and of the government watchful over an ever-simmering stew.	因为现在中国共产党所面临的政治威胁不再像1989年时那样由学生和知识分子构成，而是由工人和农民构成。 荒谬的是，毛泽东正是以这两个被剥削阶级为基础建立了他的革命，而中国共产党以正是以他们的名义进行着一直以来的一党专政。
	
Workers’ Paradise?	是工人们的天堂吗？
CAMBRIDGE -- Will the political resurgence of labor unions throw a wrench into the wheels of globalization?	剑桥 - - 众多工会组织在政治上东山再起是否会阻碍全球化的进展呢？
Or will their growing strength serve to make globalization more sustainable by fostering great equality and fairness?	或者其日益增长的实力通过促进平等和公平而让全球化更为可以持续呢？
One way or the other, unions stand as a major wild card for the evolution of our economic system in 2008 and beyond.	不管怎样，工会在2008年及其今后将会成为我们的经济制度演进中的一个难以琢磨的因素。
Unions’ rising influence is evident in many recent events: German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s controversial deal to raise minimum wages for postal employees; several American presidential candidates’ open misgivings about trade and immigration; and the Chinese leadership’s nascent concerns about labor standards.	工会日盛的影响力在最近许多事件中都昭然若揭。 德国总理默克尔为邮政职工提高最低工资引发了争议；几个美国总统侯选人对贸易和移民公开表示担忧；而中国领导人最近则对劳工标准表示关切。
Along with their political clout, unions’ intellectual respectability is also experiencing a renaissance.	工会在智识上的受尊敬程度与其政治影响力一样在复苏。 几十年来，经济学家们诽谤说工会增加了失业并限制增长。
After decades of vilification by economists for raising unemployment and strangling growth, the union movement is now receiving backing from thought leaders such as Paul Krugman, who argues that stronger unions are needed to counter globalization’s worst excesses.	现在，工会运动则得到了思想界人士例如格鲁格曼的支持。 他们说人们需要更为强大的工会来对抗全球化最为糟糕的方面。
The sudden emergence of unions as a political force is particularly surprising in the United States, where private-sector union membership has fallen from 25% in 1975 to 8% today.	在美国，工会突然间作为一支政治力量显现尤其令人惊讶。 美国私营部门工会成员人数从1975年的25%下降到今天的8 % 。
From high-tech Google to mass retailer Wal-Mart, US companies have found ways to keep their shops union-free.	从高技数的谷歌到大型零售店沃尔玛，美国的公司有办法把工会组织拒之门外。
Only the public sector, where the membership rate is 35%, has remained a union bastion.	公共部门的成员比例达到35 % ， 也只有它才继续保持成为工会的堡垒。
One of my best friends from childhood married a union organizer who found it so difficult to land a job in the US that he eventually moved his family to strike-happy Canada.	我儿时最好的一个朋友嫁给了一个工会组织者。 他发现在美国根本难以找到工作，于是最终举家搬到了罢工快乐的加拿大。
Today, US political leaders such as Congressman Barney Frank want to bring back unions.	今天，美国的政治领导人例如国会议员富兰克想要恢复工会的风光。
But there is good reason to be skeptical.	但是人们有充足的理由对此表示怀疑。
For a relatively poor country like China, real unions could help balance employers’ power, bringing quality-of-life benefits that outweigh the growth costs.	对于一个类似中国那样相对较穷的国家，真正的工会可以制约雇主的权力并且带来超过经济增长代价的生活质量的利益。
Factory conditions in parts of China are all too reminiscent of the early twentieth-century, pre-union US.	在中国的一些地方，工厂的条件让人想起二十世纪早期工会发展之前的美国。
Thousands of Chinese workers die each year in coal mines that sometimes lack basic safety precautions.	中国每年有几千名煤矿工人死亡，这些煤矿有时缺乏基本的安全保护措施。
But, for the US and rich countries in Europe, the argument that stronger unions would bring more benefits than costs is far more dubious.	但是，对于美国和欧洲的富国们来说，更为强大的工会带来的利益大于代价，这一论点是难以令人信服的。
Nowadays, most workers already have legal and statutory rights that cover the basic protections that unions originally fought for a century ago.	当今，大多数工人已经有了法律和法定权利，这些权利包含了工会在一个世纪前所争取的基本保护措施。
Instead, union influence today all too often serves to promulgate inflexible work practices and flat salary structures that do not adequately reward work effort and skill.	相反，如今工会的影响力过多地用来公布不能足以奖励工作干劲和技能的僵化的工作实务以及划一的工资结构。
It is no surprise that the public sector, where productivity is low and fiscal constraints soft, typically has the greatest union concentration.	公共部门效率低下，没有太多的财政限制，通常工会组织最为集中，这也就不足为奇了。
Teachers’ unions, especially, are a catastrophe, blocking any rationalization or improvement of many countries’ education systems.	教师工会特别是一个灾难，它们阻碍许多国家教育体系中任何合理化和改进。
Before the modern globalization era, unions could thrive by organizing on a national scale, giving them enormous bargaining power vis-à-vis both employers and consumers.	现代全球化时代之前，工会可以通过在全国范围内组织而发展壮大，从而在对雇主和消费者上给了它们巨大的讨价还价的实力。
Now, after the explosive post-war expansion of global trade, most unions have seen their monopoly power eroded, if not shattered.	现在，全球贸易在战后爆炸式发展，大多数工会发现其垄断实力要么瓦解，要么受到侵蚀。
That is why unions throughout much of the developed world have been fighting so hard to block free-trade negotiations that might erode their position further.	这就是为何发达国家中的工会不遗余力地阻碍可能进一步侵蚀其实力的自由贸易谈判。
Some of the issues that unions are promoting, such as human rights and environmental quality, are unassailable.	工会所促进得某些问题，例如人权和环境质量是无可非议的。
When they try to connect these issues with trade, however, their motives become questionable.	但是，当它们企图把这些问题与贸易挂钩的时候，它们的动机就变得可疑了。
A case in point is union lobbying against the US-Colombia free-trade agreement, ratification of which would greatly advance US-Latin American relations.	其中一个事例就是工会游说反对美国和哥伦比亚的自由贸易协议。 批准这一协议将会大大增进美国和拉美国家的关系。
Legitimate questions about how the Colombian government conducted its epic civil war with drug-financed rebels do not trump broader issues.	哥伦比亚支付与贩毒组织支持的反叛力量进行了艰苦卓绝的内战，对于其如何进行这一内战的合理的问题并不让更为广泛的问题消失殆尽。
So anti-pact activists have complained that Colombia is anti-union because it does not protect union members from rebel violence.	因此，反对这一协议的活动份子们抱怨说哥伦比亚反对工会，因为它并不保护工会成员免于反叛者的暴力。
Yet the Colombian government notes that all Colombians suffer from rebel violence – union members actually experience less of it than the rest of the population.	但是哥伦比亚政府注意到，所有的哥伦比亚人都受到反叛者暴力之苦，而工会成员实际上要比国内其他人经���的要少。
Unfortunately, this play is being re-enacted across a host of trade issues, including many involving China.	不幸的是，在许多贸易问题上这一闹剧都在重演，包括中国在内。
For rich countries, income redistribution is much better handled through taxes and benefits system, rather than by government edicts to strengthen unions.	对于富国而言，通过税收和福利制度可以更好地处理收入重新分配，而非通过政府法令来加强工会组织。
The rich today pay so little in taxes in many countries, that it would be a big improvement simply to move to a flat tax, with a very high exemption level so that lower-income families pay nothing.	如今，许多国家的富人纳税很少，倒不如干脆转向免税额度很高的单一税，这样低收入家庭就不必纳税。
For middle-income countries, it is a tougher call.	对于中等收入国家而言，这是难以做出的决定。
But here, too, increasing workers’ legal and statutory rights, while allowing most unions to fade away, seems like the right approach.	但是在这一问题上还是这样，也就是增加工人们的法律和法定权利，同时让大多数工会自生自灭似乎是一个正确的办法。
Unfortunately, we are far more likely to see unions’ growing political influence become a major destabilizing force in trade and growth, with highly uncertain consequences.	不幸的是，我们更有可能发现工会不断增长的政治影响力成为贸易和经济增长的一个主要不稳定力量，其后果令人难以预料。
When we see political leaders in many rich countries pander to unions by bashing each other on free trade and immigration, there is every reason to worry about trouble ahead.	当我们看到富有国家中的许多政治领导人通过在自由贸易和移民问题上相互抨击对方而取悦于工会之时，人们就有理由担心今后的麻烦。
That is why unions will be one of the main economic wild cards in 2008.	这就是为何工会将会成为2008年主要的一个不可知的经济因素之一。
	
The Evolution of Work	工作的演化
CAMBRIDGE – In mid-December, the United Nations will launch the latest of its annual landmark Human Development Reports.	坎布里奇—12月中旬，联合国将发布最新一期标志性的年度人权发展报告。
This year’s report focuses on the nature of work: how the way we earn a living is being transformed by economic globalization, new technologies, and innovations in social organization.	今年的报告关注焦点是工作的性质：我们讨生活的方式如何被经济全球化、新科技和社会组织方面的创新所改变。
The outlook for developing countries, in particular, is decidedly mixed.	特别是，发展中国家的前景十分模糊。
For most people most of the time, work is mostly unpleasant.	对大部分时间里的大部分人来说，工作大多是不令人愉快的。
Historically, doing lots of backbreaking work is how countries have become rich.	历史上，辛苦勤劳地工作是国家致富的源泉。
And being rich is how some people get the chance to do more pleasant work.	而变富是一些人有机会做比较令人愉快的工作的原因。
Thanks to the Industrial Revolution, new technologies in cotton textiles, iron and steel, and transportation delivered steadily rising levels of labor productivity for the first time in history.	拜工业革命所赐，棉花纺织、钢铁和交通方面的新科技给我们带来了历史上第一次劳动生产率水平的稳步提高。
First in Britain in the mid-eighteenth century, and then in Western Europe and North America, men and women flocked from the countryside to towns to satisfy factories’ growing demand for labor.	先是十九世纪中叶的英国，然后是西欧和北美，男男女女从乡村涌向城镇以满足工厂对劳动力的不断增长的需求。
But, for decades, workers gained few of the benefits of rising productivity.	但是，在几十年的时间里，工人几乎没有得到任何生产率提高所带来的好处。
They worked long hours in stifling conditions, lived in overcrowded and unsanitary housing, and experienced little growth in earnings.	他们在令人窒息的环境中长时间工作，住在没有卫生设施的拥挤的宿舍中，收入也几乎没有增长。
Some indicators, such as workers’ average height, suggest that standards of living may have even declined for a while.	一些指标，如工人平均体重，表明生活质量可能下降了一段时间。
Eventually, capitalism transformed itself and its gains began to be shared more widely.	最终，资本主义改变了它自己，其收益得到了更加广泛的分享。
This was partly because wages naturally began to rise as the surplus of rural workers dried up.	这部分是因为，随着农村剩余工人数量的枯竭，工资自然开始上涨。
But, equally important, workers organized themselves to defend their interests.	但是，同样重要的是，工人们开始自发组织起来捍卫自己的利益。
Fearing revolution, the industrialists compromised.	产业家害怕革命，只能妥协。
Civil and political rights were extended to the working class.	公民和政治权利扩大到工人阶级。
Democracy, in turn, tamed capitalism further.	民主反过来进一步制约了资本主义。
Employment conditions improved as state-mandated or negotiated arrangements led to reduced working hours, greater safety, and family, health, and other benefits.	国家规定或劳资双方商定的安排降低了工作时长，增加了安全度，提高了家庭、医疗和其他福利，就业环境有了改善。
Public investment in education and training made workers both more productive and freer to exercise choice.	教育和培训方面的公共投资提高了工人的生产率，也让他们能够更自由地进行选择。
As a result, labor’s share of the enterprise surplus rose.	于是，劳动力占企业盈余的份额开始上升。
While factory jobs never became pleasant, blue-collar occupations now enabled a middle-class standard of living, with all its consumption possibilities and lifestyle opportunities.	工厂工作仍然不令人愉快，但蓝领岗位已能够让人过上中产阶级的生活，拥有中产阶级的消费能力和生活方式机会。
Eventually, technological progress undermined industrial capitalism.	最终，科技进步打破了产业资本主义。
Labor productivity in manufacturing industries rose much faster than in the rest of the economy: The same or higher quantity of steel, cars, and electronics could be produced with far fewer workers.	制造业的劳动生产率增长远远快于经济的其他部分：质量相同或更高的钢材、汽车和电子产品，只需要少得多的工人就可以生产出来。
So the “excess” workers moved to service industries – education, health, finance, entertainment, and public administration, for example.	因此“过剩”的工人们进入服务业 — — 教育、医疗、金融、娱乐和公共管理等。
Thus was born the post-industrial economy.	后工业经济诞生了。
Work became more pleasant for some, but not for all.	对一些人来说，工作变得更加令人愉快了，但并非所有人都是如此。
For those with the skills, capital, and savvy to prosper in the post-industrial age, services offered inordinate opportunities.	对拥有技能、资本和见识，能够在后工业时代实现发达的人来说，服务业带来了超乎想象的机会。
Bankers, consultants, and engineers earned much higher wages than their industrial-age forebears.	银行家、咨询师和工程师的收入远远高于他们工业时代的前辈。
Equally important, office work allowed a degree of freedom and personal autonomy that factory work never provided.	同样重要的是，办公室工作提供了工厂工作所不具备的一定程度的自由和自主性。
Notwithstanding long hours (perhaps longer than in factory jobs), service professionals enjoyed much greater control over their daily lives and workplace decisions.	尽管工作时间很长（可能比工厂岗位更长 ） ， 但服务业专业人士能更好地控制日常生活和决定工作场合。
Teachers, nurses, and waiters were not paid nearly as well, but they, too, were released from the humdrum mechanical drudgery of the shop floor.	教师、护士和侍应生的薪酬并不是很高，但他们可以摆脱商场中单调乏味的机械式工作。
For less skilled workers, however, service-sector jobs meant giving up the negotiated benefits of industrial capitalism.	但是，对于技能较弱的工人来说，服务业岗位意味着放弃与产业资本主义商定的福利。
The transition to a service economy often went hand in hand with the decline of unions, employment protections, and norms of pay equity, greatly weakening workers’ bargaining power and job security.	转向服务经济常常与工会、就业保护、薪酬平等性规范的式微一起发生，大大削弱了工人的议价能力和岗位安全度。
So the post-industrial economy opened up a new chasm in the labor market, between those with stable, high-paid, and fulfilling services jobs and those with fleeting, low-paid, and unsatisfying jobs.	因此，后工业经济开启了劳动力市场的新差异，一端是稳定、高薪、有满足感的服务业岗位，一端是动荡、低薪、的满意度的岗��。
Two factors determined the share of each type of job – and thus the extent of inequality produced by the post-industrial transition: the education and skill level of the workforce, and the degree of institutionalization of labor markets in services (in addition to manufacturing).	两大因素决定了每一种类型岗位的比重 — — 也决定了后工业转型所带来的不平等程度：劳动力的教育和技能水平，以及（制造业以外的）服务业劳动力市场的制度化水平。
Inequality, exclusion, and duality became more marked in countries where skills were poorly distributed and many services approximated the textbook “ideal” of spot markets.	在技能分布情况糟糕、许多服务类似于教科书上的“理想”现货市场的国家，不平等、排斥和二元性日益显著。
The United States, where many workers are forced to hold multiple jobs in order to make an adequate living, remains the canonical example of this model.	在美国，许多工人被迫打多份工才能维持体面的生活，堪称这一模式的经典案例。
The vast majority of workers still live in low- and middle-income countries and have yet to go through these transformations.	仍然生活在中低收入国家的绝大部分工人尚未完成这些转型。
There are two reasons to believe that their future path will (or need) not unfold in quite the same way.	基于两个原因，可以认为他们的未来路径不会（或不必）一样。
First, there is no reason that safe working conditions, freedom of association, and collective bargaining cannot be introduced at earlier stages of development than has occurred historically.	首先，没有理由认为安全的工作环境、结社自由和集体议价必须遵循历史模式，而不能在发展的较早阶段就引入。
Just as political democracy need not wait for incomes to rise, strong labor standards need not lag behind economic development.	正如政治民主必须要等待收入上升才能开始，提高劳动标准也不一定要落后于经济发展。
Workers in low-income countries should not be deprived of fundamental rights for the sake of industrial development and export performance.	低收入国家的工人不应该为了工业发展和出口表现而被剥夺基本权利。
Second, the forces of globalization and technological progress have combined to alter the nature of manufacturing work in a way that makes it very difficult, if not impossible, for newcomers to emulate the industrialization experience of the Four Asian Tigers, or the European and North American economies before them.	其次，全球化和科技进步的力量已经形成合力，改变了制造业工作的性质，后进者很难甚至不可能模仿亚洲四小龙或更早的欧洲和北美经济体的工业化经验。
Many (if not most) developing countries are becoming service economies without having developed a large manufacturing sector – a process I have called “premature de-industrialization.”	许多（甚至大部分）发展中国家在没有发展出巨大的制造业的情况下就开始转向服务经济 — — 我称之为“早产去工业化”过程。
Could premature de-industrialization be a blessing in disguise, enabling workers in the developing world to bypass the drudgery of manufacturing?	早产去工业化可能是一种伪装的福音，让发展中世界的工人直接跳过枯燥乏味的制造业吗？
If so, how such a future could be constructed is not at all clear.	如果答案是肯定的，那么未来可能怎样尚不清楚。
A society in which most workers are self-proprietors – shopkeepers, independent professionals, or artists – and set their own terms of employment while making an adequate living is feasible only when economy-wide productivity is already very high.	一个社会中的大部分工人都自我就业 — — 成为店主、独立专业人士或艺术家 — — 有各自的就业条件，同时能够过上体面的生活，这种社会只有在全经济生产率相当高的情况下才可行。
High-productivity services – such as IT or finance – require well-trained workers, not the unskilled kind that poor countries have in abundance.	高生产率服务业 — — 如IT和金融 — — 需要受过良好训练的工人，而不是穷国遍地都是的低技能工人。
So there is both good and bad news for the future of work in developing countries.	因此，对于发展中国家的工作的未来来说，既有好消息，也有坏消息。
Thanks to social policy and labor rights, workers can become full stakeholders in the economy much earlier in the process of development.	拜社会政策和劳动权利所赐，工人能够在发展过程的较早阶段就成为经济的完全相关利益方。
At the same time, the traditional engine of economic development – industrialization – is likely to operate at much lower capacity.	与此同时，传统社会发展引擎 — — 工业化 — — 可能动力较低。
The resulting combination of high public expectations and low income-producing capacity will be a major challenge for developing economies everywhere.	由此产生的高公共预期和低收入产生能力的组合可能成为所有发展中经济体的主要挑战。
	
The Unfinished Business of Gender Parity	性别平等的未竟事业
DAVOS – When it comes to the importance of gender equality in the workplace, the message has clearly gotten through to those at the top.	达沃斯 — — 高层人士已经明确开始关注在工作场所实现性别平等的重要性等问题。
Surveys – including those conducted by my own organization – consistently show that business leaders understand the need for equal treatment of men and women in the workforce.	包括我本人所在机构进行的各项调查结果一致表明，企业领导人对于必须平等对待男女劳动者已经有了明确的认识。
Indeed, my own conversations with senior businesspeople around the world confirm that progress clearly is being made.	事实上，我与世界各地资深商务人士的对话证实在这方面正在取得显著的进步。
The vast majority recognize the issue as imperative to their companies’ success and have implemented measures to promote gender parity in their organizations.	绝大部分人认识到这对企业的成功必不可少，并已着手采取措施提高所在机构的性别平等程度。
And yet, for all the fine words, much more remains to be done before gender parity is actually achieved.	但尽管态度非常积极，真正实现性别平等还要进行很多工作。
The facts speak for themselves.	事实是不言自明的。
There is still a pay gap in every country in the world, with men earning more than women for similar jobs.	工资差距仍在世界每一个国家从事类似工作的男女员工间现实存在着。
Likewise, the percentage of seats on corporate boards occupied by women appears to have stalled at just over 17%.	同样，女性担任公司董事的比例似乎一直徘徊在17%左右。
This bias has not gone unnoticed – especially among female employees.	这样的偏见并未受到人们 — — 特别是女性员工的忽视。
In a 2015 PwC global survey of female millennials born between 1980 and 1995, half of those working in financial services said they believed that men received more favorable treatment when it came to promotions.	2015年普华永道对生于1980和1995年间的千禧女性全球调查结果显示，从事金融服务工作的女性近半数表示她们认为男性在升职方面得到的待遇更加优越。
More than 70% said that as much as their organizations talk about diversity, in reality, opportunities remain unequal.	超过70%的女性表示尽管其所在机构提倡多样性，但在现实中她们仍然得不到平等的机会。
Interestingly, other studies conclude that when women are provided with the opportunity to perform on an equal footing with men, they more often than not come out on top.	有趣的是，其他研究得出结论，当为女性和男性提供同等机会时，往往女性能够拔得头筹。
A recent ten-year analysis of 300 start-up investments backed by venture capitalists in the United States showed that companies with a female founder performed 63% better than those with all-male founding teams.	近期一份由美国风投人士出资进行的针对300家初创企业的投资分析表明，有女性创业者的企业业绩较之全是男性团队的企业高63%左右。
And another of PwC’s research programs, examining the changing faces of billionaires worldwide, discovered what we called the “Athena Factor.”	普华永道另一项研究结果显示，世界各地亿万富翁的变化体现出我们所谓的“雅典娜因素 ” 。
The increase in the number of female billionaires significantly outpaces that among men, with Asia registering the fastest growth in the ranks of self-made female billionaires.	女性富豪人数增加明显快于男性，其中增长速度最快的首推亚洲自主创业的女性富豪。
Where women have the opportunity to capitalize on their talents, they are doing so successfully and with gusto.	在女性有机会发挥才华时，她们对此满怀激情并取得了成功。
Meanwhile, there is growing recognition of the positive contribution that greater workforce diversity makes to business performance.	与此同时，劳动力多元化对企业绩效的积极贡献越来越被人们所认识到。
And yet, as reflected in the stubborn persistence of the pay gap, barriers to women’s progress remain.	不过，长期存在的工资差距显示依然存在阻碍女性进步的因素。
What is now needed is a genuine and permanent shift in attitudes and behavior.	现在需要的是态度和行为真正的永久性变化。
Many of the biases holding women back are unconscious; and, by their very nature, these blind spots cannot be tackled by statements of intent alone.	阻碍女性进步的很多是无意识因素；而且，其本身性质决定了仅靠明确目的来解决这些盲区还远远不够。
Tackling gender inequality will require us to identify where, how, and why these biases materialize, and to develop systematic strategies and interventions to root them out.	改变性别不平等需要我们明确上述偏见在哪里、为什么和怎样付诸实施，并制定系统的战略和干预措施来加以铲除。
In order to accomplish this, businesses must actively challenge men to help advance women in the workforce.	为实现上述目标，企业必须积极要求男性协助女性争取职业进步。
That is why I am proud to be a founding Corporate Impact Champion of the UN Women’s HeForShe movement.	因此我为成为联合国女性他为她运动最初的企业影响创始者而感到自豪。
Creating real and lasting change will require helping men and women work together.	男女必须竭诚合作才能实现真正的永久性变化。
The business case for doing so is incontrovertible.	这样做有着不容置疑的商业理由。
Not only do women make up half the global population; the same skills needed to work through differences in gender – open-mindedness, humility, empathy – can be used to work across other types of differences, be they cultural, physical, or personal.	不仅女性占到全球人口的一半；而且克服性别歧视所需的同样素质 — — 即开放、谦逊、同情 — — 同样可以克服文化、生理或人性等其他类型的不同。
It is important, of course, to reassure male skeptics who view gender parity as a threat.	当然，让怀疑性别平等是某种威胁的男性放心非常重要。
In June 2015, I hosted a HeForShe chat on Twitter , and while the conversation was overwhelmingly positive, an obvious concern surfaced: Why should men help promote women to positions for which they themselves are aiming?	2015年6月，我在推特上主持了他��她计划的聊天活动。 虽然谈话从总体来看非常积极，但仍然出现了某种显著的担忧：男性为什么要帮助女性得到他们自己都希望得到的职务？
Addressing such concerns will require us to show that we are not promoting some people at the expense of others; gender parity must be win-win, not zero-sum.	安抚这些担忧需要明确我们不是要以牺牲某些人为代价来抬高另一些人；性别平等必须达到双赢、而非零和的效果。
At PwC, this is being addressed by hosting conversations in which men and women discuss gender issues collaboratively and respectfully, and by working with both genders to challenge double standards and acknowledge potential blind spots.	普华永道正组织男女员工在合作和相互尊敬的基础上探讨性别问题，并与两性合作挑战双重标准、寻找潜在盲点。
Recent research suggests that, at the current rate of progress, it will take another 80 years to reach gender parity.	近期的研究表明按照目前的发展速度，还要再过80年才能实现两性平等的目标。
That is not good enough.	这样的速度远远不够。
Let us all commit to achieving it in our lifetimes – for the benefit of everyone.	让我们所有人致力于在有生之年实现 — — 这对我们每个人都有好处。
	
Four Ways to Beat HIV/AIDS	消灭艾滋病的四个办法
PITTSBURGH – In the fight against HIV/AIDS, some stories illuminate the long road to global eradication more than others.	匹兹堡—在与艾滋病的战争中，一些故事更能说明通往全球消灭艾滋病的漫漫长路。
In 2009, I heard one such story in Tanzania.	2009年，我在坦桑尼亚就听说了这样一个故事。
I was visiting a remote village when I spoke to a woman who knew that she was HIV-positive.	我访问了一个偏远村庄，和一位获知自己艾滋病毒阳性的妇女对话。
She told me that the established health guidelines at the time indicated that she could not receive treatment until her count of CD4 T-helper cells, a type of white blood cell used by the immune system, had dropped below a certain threshold.	她告诉我，当时的卫生指南说，在她的CD4 辅助性T细胞（一种免疫系统中的白血球）下降到一定阈值以下之间，她不会得到治疗。
After walking several miles to get her count checked, she arrived at the clinic only to find its testing machine broken.	她跋涉数英里去检查CD4 辅助性T细胞，到了才发现测试机器坏掉了。
The machine was still inoperative the second time she made the long journey.	过了一段时间，她又跋涉数英里去做检查，但机器仍然坏着。
Only months later, after her third trip to the clinic on foot, did she receive her cell count: her levels were far below the necessary threshold.	过了几个月，她第三次步行前往这家医院才成功地做了检查，她的细胞数量已经远远低于阈值。
Her treatment should have begun months before.	她应该在几个月前就开始获得治疗。
Since HIV/AIDS was first identified in 1984, it has killed more than 35 million people.	自1984年艾滋病第一次被识别以来，它已经杀死了3,500万多人。
Although the number of AIDS-related deaths has fallen by almost half since peaking in 2005, there are still far too many people dying from this preventable condition.	艾滋病相关死亡人数在2005年达到峰值，随后下降了近一半，但仍有太多的人因为这个可预防的疾病而失去生命。
In 2016 alone, one million people around the world died from HIV-related causes, while 1.8 million more became infected.	光是在2016年，全球就有一百万人死于与艾滋病毒有关的状况，另有180万人被感染。
Contrary to popular myth, we have not turned the corner on AIDS – not by a long shot.	与流行的故事相反，我们并没有能够扭转艾滋病形势 — — 至少从长期看没有。
World AIDS Day, on December 1, is an occasion to honor the millions of victims, and to recommit to ending this devastating disease.	12月1日是世界艾滋病日，设立这个日子是为了纪念数百万受害者和鼓励人们消灭这个可怕的疾病。
According to UNAIDS, just 54% of HIV-positive adults, and only 43% of HIV-positive children, are currently receiving the antiretroviral therapies that save lives and prevent new infections.	据联合国艾滋病规划署的数据，目前只有54%的艾滋病毒阳性成年人，以及43%的艾滋病毒阳性儿童，正在接受能够拯救生命和阻止传染的抗逆转录疗法。
With so many untreated patients, the virus will continue to spread.	得不到治疗的患者如此之多，艾滋病毒必然还在继续传播。
As CEO of a global pharmaceutical company, I’m proud of the work we have done to fight HIV/AIDS around the world.	作为一家全球制药公司的首席执行官，我对于我们在消灭艾滋病的全球战争中所做出的贡献深感自豪。
Today, more than eight million people – nearly half of all patients receiving treatment for HIV in developing countries – depend on the antiretroviral treatments that we produce.	如今，超过八百万人 — — 相当于发展中国家接受艾滋病治疗的所有患者的近一半 — — 需要依靠我们所生产的抗逆转录治疗手段。
But for those of us on the front lines of this struggle, our work is far from over.	但对于我们这些站在这场战争最前线的人来说，我们的工作还远没有结束。
The pharmaceutical industry has a responsibility to expand access to testing and treatment, and to help stop the spread of HIV once and for all.	制药业有责任扩大测试和治疗的普及度，帮助一劳永逸地阻止艾滋病毒传播。
Fulfilling four key commitments will make this goal achievable.	兑现四项关键承诺能够助我们实现这一目标。
For starters, pharmaceutical companies should do more to increase the availability of low-cost, generic medicines.	首先，制药公司应该做更多的事增加低成本通用药物的普及度。
My company, Mylan, introduced the first generic once-daily pill for developing countries in 2009, and we have continually reduced its price to make it more accessible to more people.	我的公司 — — 迈兰制药公司在2009年推出了第一种面向发展中国家的一日一次普通药，此后我们一直在调降药价，让它走近更多的人。
With this treatment alone, Mylan and other generic manufacturers save the US government, international donors, and national health programs more than $4.5 billion a year.	光是通过这种药，迈兰和其他通用药制造商每年都能为美国政府、国际捐助人和国家卫生计划节省45亿多美元。
Still, treatment options could be expanded further.	尽管如此，治疗选择可以进一步扩大。
In September, Mylan announced a collaboration with UNAIDS, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, and other partners to provide the next-generation single-pill HIV regimen to patients in more than 90 low- and middle-income countries for less than $75 per year.	9月，迈兰宣布与联合国艾滋病规划署、比尔和梅琳达·盖茨基金会、克林顿健康倡议计划（Clinton Health Access Initiative）和其他合作者携手为90多个中低收入国家以每年不到75美元的价格提供新一代单一药物艾滋病疗法。
These drugs are widely used in high-income countries because they produce fewer side effects.	这些药品因其副作用更小而在高收入国家广泛使用。
Affordability initiatives like this one should be replicated.	此类平价计划应该被广泛复制。
Next, drug makers must continue investing in capacity and supply-chain reliability.	其次，制药商必须继续投资于产能和供给链可靠性建设。
Since 2005, the number of people on antiretroviral therapies worldwide has grown by a factor of ten, to 21 million.	自2005年以来，全世界接受抗逆转录治疗的人数增加了十倍，达到了2,100万人。
But roughly twice as many people are currently infected with HIV.	但目前被艾滋病毒感染的人数两倍于此。
Over the last decade, Mylan has invested more than $250 million in expanding production capacity, and we now produce four billion tablets and capsules each year.	在过去十年中，迈兰公司投入了2.5亿多美元用于扩大产能，目前我们每年都要生产四十亿片药片和胶囊。
But further investments are needed if we are to provide access to the other 21 million people still not on treatment.	但如果要为另外2,100万仍然得不到治疗的人提供药物，还需要更多投资。
A third urgently needed commitment is to increase support for research that accelerates the development of new innovations in effective and efficient treatment delivery.	第三项继续做出的承诺是增加研究支持和加快高效治疗实现的新创新的开发。
For example, Mylan provides study medications to research trials, like the MaxART trial in Swaziland, which demonstrated that providing treatment to all HIV-positive people is the best way to slow the disease’s spread.	比如，迈兰公司为研究实验提供研究药品，比如斯威士兰的MaxART试验，该试验发现，向所有艾滋病毒阳性人员提供治疗是遏制艾滋病蔓延的最佳办法。
We also supported the Kirby Institute’s ENCORE1 trial, to develop a reduced-dose version of the most commonly used HIV treatment regimen.	我们还支持科尔比研究所（Kirby Institute）的ENCORE1测试，该测试要开发最常用艾滋病疗法的减剂量版。
And we are currently working with the US Agency for International Development as part of a partnership called OPTIMIZE, which aims to accelerate access to new therapies.	目前，我们还与美国国际开发署进行合作，这是一个叫作“优化 ” （ OPTIMIZE）的合作项目的一部分，其目的是加快新疗法的普及。
We do not support trials like these because we hope to gain any marketable intellectual property – we won’t.	我们支持此类试验不是因为我们向获得可以待价而沽的知识产权。
Rather, we support them because it is the right way to advance science and improve treatment.	相反，我们支持这些试验是因为这是推动科学、改进疗法的正确方法。
Finally, real gains in the fight against HIV/AIDS will require drug makers to account for the limitations of health-care systems and distribution networks in the developing countries they serve.	最后，艾滋病战争的真正收益需要制药公司顾及它们所服务的发展中国的医疗体系和分销网络的极限。
Antiretroviral therapies for children are a good example of these challenges.	儿童抗逆转录治疗是这类挑战的一个显例。
Drugs for young people produced in the West are often liquids that require refrigeration.	西方所生产的年轻人用药通常为液态，需要冷藏。
But developing countries often have limited cold-storage capacities or an inability to transport liquid in bulk.	但发展中国家常常冷藏能力不足，也不具备大量运输液体的能力。
That’s why Mylan has developed heat-stable, taste-masked, dispersible tablets that can easily be incorporated into food.	因此，迈兰公司开发了一种热稳定的矫味分散片，可以方便地掺在食品中。
Our scientists are now working on the next-generation formula, which comes in the equivalent of a sugar packet that even newborns can take.	我们的科学家正在开发新一代配方，将采用糖包，即使是新生儿也可以服用。
More innovations like these will be needed to solve the country-specific issues that patients face.	我们需要更多类似的创新来解决具体国家患者所面临的问题。
The global health community has made remarkable progress in turning the tide on HIV/AIDS, introducing new products and advocating for earlier treatment.	全球医疗界在扭转艾滋病趋势方面做出了重大进步，引入了新产品，推动了提早治疗。
But when I think back to the woman I met in Tanzania, I am reminded of how much work remains to be done.	但每当我回想起在坦桑尼亚遇到的那位妇女，我就会想起还有很多工作等着我们完成。
Makers of generic medicines have an important role to play in this fight, and we will not stop working until treatment is available to every patient in the world who needs it.	通用药制造商在这场战争中扮演着重要角色，我们会一直致力于此，直到全世界所有需要的患者都能得到治疗。
	
The World Bank Needs to Return to Its Mission	世界银行需要回归其使命
NEW YORK – The World Bank declares that its mission is to end extreme poverty within a generation and to boost shared prosperity.	纽约 — — 世界银行宣称在一代人的时间里消除赤贫、促进共同繁荣是其使命。
These goals are universally agreed as part of the Sustainable Development Goals.	上述目标被普遍认为是可持续发展目标的组成部分。
But the World Bank lacks an SDG strategy, and now it is turning to Wall Street to please its political masters in Washington.	但世界银行缺乏可持续发展战略，而现在它正在转向华尔街，以取悦华盛顿的政治领袖。
The Bank’s president, Jim Yong Kim, should find a better way forward, and he can do so by revisiting one of his own great successes.	世行行长金墉应当通过回顾自己曾经取得的重大成功找到一条更好的前进之路。
Kim and I worked closely together from 2000 to 2005, to scale up the world’s response to the AIDS epidemic.	2000到2005年金墉和我曾密切合作，以推广世界各国对艾滋病疫情的应对之策。
Partners in Health, the NGO led by Kim and his colleague, Harvard University’s Paul Farmer, had used antiretroviral medicines (ARVs) to treat around 1,000 impoverished HIV-infected rural residents in Haiti, and had restored them to health and hope.	由金及其同事，哈佛大学的保罗·法莫共同领导的非政府组织“健康伙伴 ” （ Health in Health）一直在使用抗逆转录病毒的药物（AVR）来治疗约1，000名被艾滋病毒感染的贫困的海地乡村居民，并使他们的健康和希望得以恢复。
I pointed out to Kim and Farmer 18 years ago that their success in Haiti could be expanded to reach millions of people at low cost and with very high social benefits.	18年前我就曾对金和法默指出可以对他们在海地的成功进行推广，以较低的代价和非常高的社会效益惠及成百上千万民众。
I recommended a new multilateral funding mechanism, a global fund, to fight AIDS, and a new funding effort by the United States.	我推荐了一种新的多边投资机制，一支抗击艾滋病的全球基金，以及促使美国开展新的投资项目。
In early 2001, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan launched the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, and in 2003 US President George W. Bush launched the PEPFAR program.	2001年初，联合国秘书长安南发起了抗击艾滋病、结核病和疟疾的全球基金，2003年，美国总统乔治·W·布什牵头发起了总统防治艾滋病紧急援助（PEPFAR）计划。
The World Health Organization, led by the Director-General Gro Harlem Brundtland, recruited Kim to lead the WHO’s scale-up effort.	由总干事布伦特兰夫人领导的世界卫生组织招募金墉来领导世卫组织的扩大工作。
Kim did a fantastic job, and his efforts provided the groundwork for bringing ARVs to millions, saving lives, livelihoods, and families.	金出色的完成了这项任务，他通过努力将抗逆转录病毒药物带给成百上千万人，为挽救生命、生计和无数家庭奠定了基础。
There are four lessons of that great success.	这一伟大的成功有四条经验可以汲取。
First, the private sector was an important partner, by offering patent-protected drugs at production cost.	首先，私营部门是重要的合作伙伴，以生产成本提供具有专利保护的药物。
Drug companies eschewed profits in the poorest countries out of decency and for the sake of their reputations.	药品企业为了顾全声誉和体面放弃了最贫困国家的利润。
They recognized that patent rights, if exercised to excess, would be a death warrant for millions of poor people.	他们认识到如果过度行使专利保护，就会成为成百上千万贫困民众的催命符。
Second, the effort was supported by private philanthropy, led by Bill Gates, who inspired others to contribute as well.	其次，由比尔·盖茨领导的私人慈善机构支持开展这项工作，并激励其他人也这么做。
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation backed the new Global Fund, the WHO, and the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, which I led for the WHO in 2000-2001 (and which successfully campaigned for increased donor funding to fight AIDS and other killer diseases).	比尔和梅林达·盖茨基金会支持新全球基金、世卫组织以及2000到2001年我所领导的宏观经济与医疗委员会（该委员会成功地争取了抗击艾滋病和其他致命疾病捐助资金的增加 ） 。
Third, the funding to fight AIDS took the form of outright grants, not Wall Street loans.	第三，抗击艾滋病的基金采用的形式是直接赠款而非华尔街贷款。
Fighting AIDS in poor countries was not viewed as a revenue-generating investment needing fancy financial engineering.	在贫穷国家抗击艾滋病并没有被视为需要复杂金融操作的创收型投资。
It was regarded as a vital public good that required philanthropists and high-income countries to fund life-saving treatment for poor and dying people.	这项事业被认为是需要慈善家和高收入国家为贫困和垂死民众提供救命治疗的至关重要的公共服务。
Fourth, trained public health specialists led the entire effort, with Kim and Farmer serving as models of professionalism and rectitude.	第四，由受过专业培训的公共卫生专家来领导这项工作，职业和诚实的典型代表就是金和法莫。
The Global Fund does not stuff the pockets of corrupt ministers, or trade funding for oil concessions or arms deals.	全球基金并没有流向腐败部长们的口袋，也没有用卫生资金来交换石油特许权或武器协定。
The Global Fund applies rigorous, technical standards of public health, and holds recipient countries accountable – including through transparency and co-financing requirements – for delivering services.	全球基金采用严格的纯技术公共卫生标准，并通过账目透明和联合出资等规定对资金接受国的服务提供情况进行问责。
The World Bank needs to return to its mission.	世行需要回归自己的使命。
The SDGs call for, among other things, ending extreme poverty and hunger, instituting universal health coverage, and universal primary and upper secondary education by 2030.	可持续发展目标要求在2030年之前结束极端贫困和饥饿、实现全民健康覆盖和普及小学和高中教育的目标。
But, despite making only slow progress toward these goals, the Bank shows no alarm or strategy to help get the SDGs on track for 2030.	但尽管在实现上述目标方面进展非常缓慢，但世行却并未引起警惕、也没有制定相应的策略以求实现2030年可持续发展目标。
On the contrary, rather than embrace the SDGs, the Bank is practically mute, and its officials have even been heard to mutter negatively about them in the corridors of power.	事实上，世行不但没有拥抱可持续发展目标，反而装聋作哑，而有人甚至听到世行官员在权力走廊上消极抱怨可持续发展目标。
Perhaps US President Donald Trump doesn’t want to hear about his government’s responsibilities vis-à-vis the SDGs.	也许美国总统唐纳德·特朗普并不想听到有关美国政府在可持续发展目标方面的责任。
But it is Kim’s job to remind him and the US Congress of those obligations – and that it was a Republican president, George W. Bush who creatively and successfully pursued the battle against AIDS.	但金有义务提醒他和美国国会 — — 恰恰是共和党总统乔治·W·布什创造性地成功支持了抗击艾滋病的战斗。
Wall Street may help to structure the financing of large-scale renewable energy projects, public transport, highways, and other infrastructure that can pay its way with tolls and user fees.	华尔街或许有助于安排能靠收取通行费和使用费偿还贷款的大规模可再生能源项目、公共交通、高速公路和其他基础设施项目的融资工作。
A World Bank-Wall Street partnership could help to ensure that such projects are environmentally sound and fair to the affected communities.	世行与华尔街合作有助于确保这些项目不损害环境，并确保这些项目对不同群体的影响是公平的。
That would be all for the good.	这些都是好的结果。
Yet such projects, designed for profit or at least direct cost recovery, are not even remotely sufficient to end extreme poverty.	但这些旨在牟取利润或至少收回直接成本的项目就连消除极端贫困都远远不够。
Poor countries need grants, not loans, for basic needs like health and education.	贫困国家需要拨款而非贷款，以满足医疗和教育方面的基本需求。
Kim should draw on his experience as the global health champion who successfully battled against AIDS, rather than embracing an approach that would only bury poor countries in debt.	金应该借鉴他成功主导抗艾滋病斗争的全球健康经验，而不是只会把贫困国家淹没在债务当中。
We need the World Bank’s voice and strenuous efforts to mobilize grant financing for the SDGs.	我们需要世行积极宣传并致力引导为实现可持续发展目标筹集援助资金的工作。
Health care for the poor requires systematic training and deployment of community health workers, diagnostics, medicines, and information systems.	为穷人提供医疗服务需要全面培训和部署社区卫生工作者，并建立诊断、药物和信息系统。
Education for the poor requires trained teachers, safe and modern classrooms, and connectivity to other schools and to online curricula.	为穷人提供教育需要训练有素的教师、安全现代的教室，并连接其他学校以及在线课程。
These SDGs can be achieved, but only if there is a clear strategy, grant financing, and clear delivery mechanisms.	上述可持续发展目标可以实现，但前提是必须要有明确的战略、拨款资助和明确的分配机制。
The World Bank should develop the expertise to help donors and recipient governments make these programs work.	世界银行应当发展专业能力，协助捐助者和受援国政府取得这些项目的成功。
Kim knows just how to do this, from his own experience.	金在这方面有着丰富的经验，他知道怎样做才能实现目标。
Trump and other world leaders are personally accountable for the SDGs.	特朗普和其他世界领袖均对可持续发展目标负有个人义务。
They need to do vastly more.	他们需要付出比现在多得多的努力。
So, too, do the world’s super-rich, whose degree of wealth is historically unprecedented.	全世界超富阶层也是一样，他们所掌握的财富比例从历史上来看可谓前所未有。
The super-rich have received round after round of tax cuts and special tax breaks, easy credits from central banks, and exceptional gains from technologies that are boosting profits while lowering unskilled workers’ wages.	超级富豪已经获得了一轮又一轮的减税和特别税收优惠，他们能够轻松得到央行贷款，并在推高利润的同时获得非技术工人薪酬降低带来的巨大好处。
Even with stock markets’ recent softness, the world’s 2000+ billionaires have around $10 trillion in wealth – enough to fund fully the incremental effort needed to end extreme poverty, if the governments also do their part.	即使近来股票市场疲软，全球2000多位亿万富豪也拥有约10万亿美元左右的财富 — — 如果政府也能够尽其所能，这些财富足以为消除极端贫困所需的渐进式努力提供资金援助。
When going to Wall Street, or Davos, or other centers of wealth, the World Bank should inspire the billionaires to put their surging wealth into personal philanthropy to support the SDGs.	在访问华尔街、达沃斯或其他财富中心时，世界银行应当鼓励亿万富翁将他们激增的财富投入个人慈善，用于支持实现可持续发展目标。
Bill Gates is doing this, with historic results, for public health.	比尔·盖茨正在从事这项事业，并在公共卫生领域取得了历史性的成果。
Which billionaires will champion the SDGs for education, renewable energy, fresh water and sanitation, and sustainable agriculture?	哪些亿万富翁将主导教育、可再生能源、淡水及卫生设备以及可持续农业等领域的可持续发展目标？
With a clear SDG plan, the World Bank would find partners to help it fulfill its core, historic, and vital mission.	凭借明确的可持续发展目标计划，世行将找到合作伙伴，协助其完成历史性且至关重要的核心任务。
	
The ABCs of Doing Business	关于《营商环境》的基本点
NEW YORK – The World Bank’s annual Doing Business (DB) report is probably its most-cited publication.	纽约—世界银行年度《营商环境 》 （ Doing Business）报告也许是被援引最多的出版物。
It is also the Bank’s most contentious, and with the release of Doing Business 2018 last October, the controversy surrounding the report has reached new heights, with some critics accusing it of obfuscation, data rigging, and political manipulation.	它也是世界银行最有争议的报告，去年10月《2018年营商环境报告 》 （ Doing Business 2018）发布后，围绕该报告的争议达到了新高度，一些批评指责报告含义模糊，玩弄数据，还受到政治操纵。
I was closely involved with the DB report from 2012 to 2016, so I had to restrain myself from jumping into the debate on the topic.	我深度参与了2012—2016年间的营商报告，因此一直没有加入争论。
But now, a review of the DB index and annual report seems worthwhile.	但如今，对营商报告指数和年报做一番评论似乎是有意义的。
I first became familiar with the DB report when I was an adviser to the Indian government and would look to it for ideas about how to cut India’s notoriously cumbersome bureaucratic red tape.	我熟悉营商报告是在印度政府顾问任上，我从中寻找关于如何削减印度臭名昭著的繁文缛节和官样文章的思维。
So, when I moved to the World Bank and learned that I would be overseeing the DB team, it was like a regular restaurant patron suddenly being asked to supervise the kitchen.	因此，当我来到世界银行任职，并获知将领导营商报告团队时，我就像是一位突然被任命负责厨房的饭店常客。
The upshot was that I learned all that went on behind the scenes.	结果是我了解到关于营商报告背后的一切。
And although I had some conceptual disagreements, I was impressed by the integrity of the process.	而尽管我有一些概念上的不同见解，仍对整个过程的完整性印象深刻。
The DB index aims to measure, across countries, the ease of starting a business, obtaining the relevant permits, accessing essential infrastructure, and so forth.	营商指数的目标是衡量各国创办企业、获得相关许可、获得必要基础设施等方面的容易程度。
It comprises ten indicators, each of which is based on various sub-indicators, and all of which are aggregated, according to a fixed rule, into a final score that determines a country’s ranking among 190 economies.	它包括十个指标，每一个都基于众多次级指标。 所有次级指标根据固定规则加总后得出一个分数，决定了一国在190个国家中的排位。
According to the 2018 report, New Zealand and Singapore are the world’s best and second-best places to do business, and Eritrea and Somalia are the worst, at 189 and 190, respectively.	根据2018年报告，新西兰和新加坡是全球排名第一和第二的营商目的地，厄立特里亚和索马里情况最遭，分列第189和190位。
Although there were aspects of the DB rankings that I did not like, I do not find the recent charges of data rigging to be credible.	尽管我不太喜欢营商环境排名中的某些指标，但我也不认为最近关于玩弄数据的指控可信。
Having personally supervised much of the process, which involves a very large team compiling economic data from around the world, I can vouch for the multiple layers of checks and balances that are in place.	从我个人经验出发，我负责过整个过程的大部分，其中包括一支庞大的团队负责搜集全球经济数据，我可以证明，我们有多层次的制衡机制。
Nevertheless, there certainly are ways to influence the rankings without cooking up data.	尽管如此，肯定有办法再不操纵数据的情况下影响排名。
With any big operation – whether it is the DB or an effort to measure GDP – one occasionally discovers conceptual flaws.	任何大操作 — — 不管是营商报告还是衡量GDP数字 — — 都会出现偶尔的概念性漏洞。
For example, when I first took over the process, I disagreed with the prevailing assumption that a higher tax rate is necessarily worse for an economy.	比如，我第一次主管营商报告时就有过分歧：我不同意高税率一定不利于经济的假设。
After all, the same logic dictates that the lower the tax rate, the better, which implies that a tax rate of zero is optimal.	毕竟，同样的逻辑意味着税率越低越好，进而零税率最好。
But that is obviously absurd.	但这显然是荒谬的。
Even if one ignores the moral dimensions, a very low tax rate leaves a country more exposed to the threat of severe fiscal crises, which are a nightmare for business.	即使忽略道德因素，极低的利率也让一国更加容易面临严重财政危机，而财政危机对企业来说是一场噩梦。
Steps were taken to make some minimal corrections that would not be too disruptive.	我们采取了一些措施，做了一些影响不会太大的小修正。
Still, recognizing such problems poses a dilemma.	尽管如此，认识到这些问题仍然带来了一个困境。
It is never ideal to have to change a yardstick that has been used to track changes over time; but nor is it right to rely on an assumption that one knows to be flawed.	不得不改变用于追踪随时间发生的变化的基准绝非理想情况；但依靠已知有缺陷的假设也不正确。
At the end of the day, it’s a judgment call.	最终需要进行一些调整。
For my part, I mitigated against possible biases by not even looking at the final result until I had first decided, using abstract reasoning, which changes were essential.	对我来说，我减少可能的偏见的办法是着眼于最终结果，直至我通过抽象推理做出关于必须做出哪些改变的初步决定。
In this year’s DB, the two big controversies concern India’s rise and Chile’s fall.	在今年的营商报告中，两项较大争议是印度排名上升和智利排名下降。
Between 2016 and 2017, India moved from 130th to 100th place.	2016—2017年间，印度从第130名上升至第100名。
I no longer have inside information on the data, but I can see two reasons why this could occur.	我现在不清楚关于数据的内幕，但我认为有两个原因。
First, if a country is determined to move up the ranking, it can do so by focusing on the ten indicators that determine the final score, though this is not a national economic strategy that I would recommend.	首先，如果一国决心要提高排名，可以专注于决定最终分数的十个指标，尽管我并不推荐将此作为国家经济战略。
Second, any change in ranking can be driven either by what a country does relative to other countries, or by measurement changes that the DB may have instituted in a given year – changes like those mentioned above.	其次，排名的变化可以由一国相对另一国做了什么决定，也可以由营商报告在某个年度所进行的衡量指标变化决定 — — 比如上文所提及的变化。
For example, when India moved from 142nd to 130th place between 2014 and 2015, the DB team and I computed that only four of the 12 positions that India had climbed reflected changes India had made, with the remainder attributable to changes in the DB methodology.	比如，2014—2015年间印度从第142名上升到第130名，期间营商报告团队和我测算，在这12个位次的攀升中，只有四个是因为印度所做出的改变，其他都可以归因为营商数据指标方法的改变。
As for Chile, which slipped from 48th to 57th place between 2015 and 2016, and is now ranked 55th, it is worth noting that there is a lot of cheek-by-jowl competition at the higher end of the ranking.	智利则在2015—2016年间从第48名下滑到第57名，目前排在第55名。 其中值得关注的是，较高排名区间竞争非常激烈。
Small changes by countries that neighbor one another in the index can result in a sharp reordering.	在排名中彼此接近的国家指标的微小变化就有可能产生剧烈的升降。
But it is also true that Chilean President Michelle Bachelet’s government has placed greater emphasis on social indicators than on economic indicators.	但智利总统巴切莱特政府更加强调社会指标而非经济指标也是事实。
To my mind, that is a cause for praise, not criticism.	在我看来，这值得赞扬而不是批评。
Having worked with Bachelet on the World Bank’s 2018 World Development Report on education, I know that she is that rare politician who is genuinely committed to improving social welfare.	我和巴切莱特一起参与了世界银行2018年《世界发展报告 》 （ World Development Report）教育篇，深知她是那种罕见的真正致力于改善社会福利的政治家。
Many countries and political leaders make the mistake of equating the DB ranking with overall welfare.	许多国家和政治领导人都犯了一个错误：将营商环境排名等同于总体福利。
But the DB merely measures what it says it measures: the ease of doing business.	但营商环境只衡量它明言试图衡量的东西：营商的容易程度。
That is certainly important for an economy, but it isn’t everything.	这对于经济来说当然很重要，但并非全部。
In fact, one of the first lessons of economics is that all good things in life involve tradeoffs.	事实上，经济学的第一课就教育我们，生活中的一切好东西都包含了权衡。
It would be a pity to see more countries focusing only on “doing business” to the exclusion of other indicators of wellbeing.	更多国家只关注“营商 ” ， 而不顾其他福利指标，这是令人遗憾的现象。
	
The Risk of a New Economic Non-Order	新经济无序的风险
LONDON – Next month, when finance ministers and central bank governors from more than 180 countries gather in Washington, DC, for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, they will confront a global economic order under increasing strain.	伦敦—下个月，180多个国家的财政部长和央行官员将齐聚华盛顿，参加国际货币基金组织（IMF）和世界银行峰会。 他们面临着一个日益吃紧的全球经济秩序。
Having failed to deliver the inclusive economic prosperity of which it is capable, that order is subject to growing doubts – and mounting challenges.	这一秩序没能带来它有能力实现的包容经济繁荣，正在受到越来越多的质疑和挑战。
Barring a course correction, the risks that today’s order will yield to a world economic non-order will only intensify.	如果不予以纠正的话，现有秩序导致世界经济失序的风险还会继续增加。
The current international economic order, spearheaded by the United States and its allies in the wake of World War II, is underpinned by multilateral institutions, including the IMF and the World Bank.	当前的国际经济秩序由美国及其盟友在二战后引领，其基础是包括IMF和世界银行在内的多边机构。
These institutions were designed to crystallize member countries’ obligations, and they embodied a set of best economic-policy practices that evolved into what became known as the “Washington Consensus.”	这些机构设立的初衷是为了明确成员国的义务，它们也包含了一系列最佳经济政策实践，即日后著名的“华盛顿共识 ” 。
That consensus was rooted in an economic paradigm that aimed to promote win-win interactions among countries, emphasizing trade liberalization, relatively unrestricted cross-border capital flows, free-market pricing, and domestic deregulation.	这一共识植根于一个旨在促进各国间双赢互动的经济范式，它强调贸易自由化、相对不受限制的跨境资本流、自由市场定价以及国内去监管化。
All of this stood in stark contrast to what developed behind the Iron Curtain and in China over the first half of the postwar period.	所有这些都与铁幕之后的国家和中国在战后时期上半段的做法截然不同。
For several decades, the Western-led international order functioned well, helping to deliver prosperity and relative financial stability.	几十年来，西方领导的国际秩序运转良好，帮助实现了繁荣和相对金融稳定。
Then it was shaken by a series of financial shocks that culminated in the 2008 global financial crisis, which triggered cascading economic failures that pushed the world to the edge of a devastating multi-year depression.	接着，它遭遇了一系列金融冲击，2008年全球金融危机为其高潮，它触发了一连串经济失灵，让世界几乎跌入灾难性的多年萧条。
It was the most severe economic breakdown since the Great Depression of the 1930s.	这是自20世纪30年代大萧条以来最严重的经济倒退。
But the crisis did not appear out of nowhere to challenge a healthy economic order.	但这场危机并不是无中生有冒出来挑战健康的经济秩序的。
On the contrary, the evolution of the global order had long been outpaced by structural economic changes on the ground, with multilateral governance institutions taking too long to recognize fully the significance of financial-sector developments and their impact on the real economy, or to make adequate room for emerging economies.	相反，全球秩序的演化一直落后于结构性经济变化，多边治理机构充分认识金融业的发展及其对实体经济的影响消耗了太长时间，为新兴经济体创造足够空间的动作也过于缓慢。
For example, governance structures, including voting power, correspond better to the economic realities of yesterday than to those of today and tomorrow.	比如，包括投票权在内的治理结构更适合过去的经济现实，但已与今天和未来的经济现实不甚相容。
And nationality, rather than merit, still is the dominant guide for the appointment of these institutions’ leaders, with top positions still reserved for European and US citizens.	国籍，而不是资质，仍然是任命这些机构领导者的主要原则，最高职位被欧洲和美国公民垄断。
The destabilizing consequences of this obstinate failure to reform sufficiently multilateral governance have been compounded by China’s own struggle to reconcile its domestic priorities with its global economic responsibilities as the world’s second-largest economy.	顽固地不肯充改革多边治理所造成的动摇性后果，因为中国难以调和其国内重点和身为世界第二大经济体的全球经济责任而加剧。
Several other countries, particularly among the advanced economies, have also failed to transform their domestic policies to account for changes to economic relationships resulting from globalization, liberalization, and deregulation.	其他一些国家，特别是经济发达国家，也没能转变国内政策以顾及全球化、自由化和去监管化所导致的经济关系变化。
As a result of all of this, the balance of winners and losers has become increasingly extreme and more difficult to manage, not just economically, but also politically and socially.	拜所有这些因素所赐，赢家和输家的平衡变得更加极端和难以管理，不仅经济上是如此，政治和社会上也是如此。
With too many people feeling marginalized, forgotten, and dispossessed – and angry at the leaders and institutions that have allowed this to happen – domestic policy pressure has intensified, causing countries to turn inward.	太多的人感到被边缘化，被遗忘，被剥夺 — — 对放任这些情况发生的领导人和机构充满了愤怒 — — 国内政策压力也随之日益加剧，导致各国不得不向内转。
This tendency is reflected in recent challenges to several features of the economic order, such as the North American Free-Trade Agreement, as well as America’s withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the United Kingdom’s renunciation of European Union membership.	这一趋势体现为最近经济秩序的某些标志（如北美自由贸易协定）受到挑战，以及美国从跨太平洋合作伙伴关系中退出、英国放弃欧盟成员国资格等。
All are casting a shadow on the future of the global economic system.	所有这些都给全球经济体系的未来蒙上了一层阴影。
America’s inward turn, already underway for several years, has been particularly consequential, because it leaves the world order without a main conductor.	美国的向内转已经进行了多年，其影响尤其重大，因为这导致世界秩序失去了舵手。
With no other country or group of countries anywhere close to being in a position to carry the baton, the emergence of what the political scientist Ian Bremmer has called a “G-Zero era” becomes a lot more probable.	其他国家或国家集团都无法接过美国的接力棒，政治学家伊恩·布雷默（Ian Bremmer）所谓的“G-0时代”的出现已是板上钉钉。
China is responding to the global system’s weakening core by accelerating its efforts to build small networks, including around the traditional Western-dominated power structures.	面对全球体系核心的衰落，中国的应对之道是加快构建小网络的步伐，包括在传统的西方主导的权力结构之外另起炉灶。
This has included the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the proliferation of bilateral payments agreements, and the pursuit of the “Belt and Road Initiative” to build infrastructure linking China with western Asia, Europe, and Africa.	其中包括建立亚洲基础设施投资银行、各种双边支付协定的涌现，以及推出“一带一路计划”建设连接中国和西亚、欧洲和非洲的基础设施。
These dynamics are stoking trade tensions and raising the risk of economic fragmentation.	这些动态助长着贸易紧张，也提高了经济分裂的风险。
If this trend continues, the global economic and financial configuration will become increasingly unstable, amplifying geopolitical and security threats at a time when better cross-border coordination is vital to address threats from non-state actors and disruptive regimes, such as North Korea.	如果这一趋势继续下去，全球经济和金融格局将越来越不稳定，加剧地缘和安全威胁，而与此同时，加强跨境合作才是解决来自非国家行动方和破坏性政权（如朝鲜）的威胁的关键。
Over time, the risks associated with this shift toward a global economic non-order could have severe adverse effects on geopolitics and national security.	假以时日，伴随向全球经济无序的转变所产生的风险可能给地缘政治和国家安全造成严重的消极影响。
None of this is new.	所有这些都不是新鲜事。
Yet, year after year, top government officials at the IMF/World Bank annual meetings fail to address it.	但是，年复一年，参加IMF/世界银行年会的政府高官们都无法解决它们。
This year is likely to be no different.	今年预计也不会有什么不同。
Instead of discussing concrete steps to slow and reverse the march toward a global economic non-order, officials will probably welcome the cyclical uptick in global growth and urge member countries to do more to remove structural impediments to faster, more durable, and more inclusive growth.	官员们不会讨论延缓和扭转通往全球经济无序的进程，更有可能因为全球增长的周期性好转而欢欣鼓舞，敦促成员国加大力度克服结构性障碍，构建更快、更持久、更包容的增长。
While understandable, that isn’t good enough.	这一点可以理解，但不够好。
The upcoming meetings offer a critical opportunity to start a serious discussion of how to arrest the lose-lose dynamics that have been gaining traction in the global economy.	即将到来的会议是一次关键的机会，开启关于如何扭转在全球经济中势头渐猛的双输动态的严肃讨论。
The longer it takes for the seeds of reform to be sown, the less likely they will be to take root – and the higher the probability that a lose-lose world economic non-order will emerge.	改革种子撒播的越晚，它们深根发芽的可能性就越小，而出现双输的世界经济经济无序局面的概率就越大。
	
Poverty Beyond the Numbers	数字之外的贫困
ASUNCIÓN – What is poverty?	亚松森—什么是贫困？
For decades, we have defined it with a number, which the World Bank currently puts at a personal income of less than $1.90 per day.	几十年来，我们用数字来给它定义，世界银行目前的标准是个人收入低于每天1.90美元。
But a single number fails to capture the complexity of poverty.	但一个数字是无法捕捉到贫困的复杂性的。
Measuring more than just income is essential to understanding the needs of poor people and delivering optimal assistance.	用收入以外的指标进行衡量对于理解穷人的需要和给予最优援助至关重要。
As the World Bank convenes its Spring Meetings in Washington, DC next week, we have an opportunity to set benchmarks that include social and environmental dimensions of poverty.	下周，世界银行将在华盛顿召开春季会议，我们有机会设定包含贫困的社会和环境因素在内的基准。
The Bank has acknowledged that more than income should be considered, and recently established a Commission on Global Poverty to recommend additional metrics.	世界银行承认应该考虑收入之外的指标，并在最近成立了全球贫困委员会推荐增加的指标。
Although many public and private groups already collect data on a range of issues affecting poor communities such as nutrition, maternal health, or access to education, such information remains largely untapped and is rarely shared across institutions.	尽管众多公共和私人团体已经开始收集影响贫困社区的一系列问题的数据，如营养、母婴健康、教育普及度等，但这些信息仍然没有得到充分利用，并很少在机构间共享。
But there are some beacons of light, including the Social Progress Index, which provides a framework for tracking multiple symptoms of poverty across countries and complements traditional income-based measures.	但也有一些希望之光，如社会进步指数提供了一个追踪不同国家多种贫困指标的框架，可以补充传统的基于收入的指标。
When we rely on a single number to measure poverty, we misdiagnose the needs of poor people.	当我们依靠一个数字来衡量贫困时，我们误判了穷人的需要。
In my home country, Paraguay, I work with one of the country’s largest social enterprises, Fundación Paraguaya, to provide microfinance, education, and training to thousands of our poorest citizens.	在我的祖国巴拉圭，我与我国最大的社会机构之一巴拉圭基金会（Fundación Paraguaya）合作为成千上万最贫穷巴拉圭公民提供微金融、教育和培训。
We look at 50 metrics across six dimensions of poverty, including income, housing, education, and infrastructure.	我们着眼于六个贫困维度的50个指标，包括收入、住房、教育和基础设施。
One of our clients, Doña Mercedes, is now a successful micro-entrepreneur from a rural community not far from the capital city of Asunción.	我们的客户之一唐娜·梅赛德斯（Doña Mercedes）现在是一位成功的微企业家，她出身于距离首都亚松桑不远的农村社区。
When she first started with Fundación Paraguaya, she was sharing a single-bedroom home with 16 other family members and cooking meals on a small fire pit on the dirt floor.	当她从巴拉圭基金会起步时，她与16位其他家庭成员共享一个单间，在泥土地板上支起一个小火炉做饭。
Now she has a cement floor, a brick house, a separate kitchen, and around $500 in personal savings.	现在她有了水泥地板、砖瓦房和独立厨房，还有500美元个人储蓄。
By using Fundación Paraguaya’s self-evaluation on poverty, she was able to understand her own needs better and address them one at time.	通过使用巴拉圭基金会的贫困自我评估，她得以逐一认识和解决自身需要。
While traditional approaches focus largely on estimating the sources of household expenses and income, the Fundación Paraguaya self-evaluation helped Doña Mercedes break down her needs into 50 discrete areas that she could work on, piece by piece, and monitor over time.	传统方法主要专注于估计家庭支出和收入源，而巴拉圭基金会的自我评估帮助唐娜·梅赛德斯将她的需要分解为50个具体的部分，让她可以逐步逐个努力解决���并随时监控效果。
For example, she self-evaluated the state of her bathroom and kitchen, the quality of the food eaten at home, the family’s dental health, the number of separate bedrooms in the house, and even her self-esteem and decision-making capacity.	比如，她自我评估了卫生间和厨房状态、在家吃的食物的质量、家庭的牙齿健康、房子中独立卧室的数量，甚至她的自尊心和决策能力。
A simple poverty map helps her track her progress by using the colors of the stoplight, red, yellow, and green, and highlight her priority areas.	一张简单的贫困地图通过信号灯的颜色 — — 红、黄、绿以及将重点区域高亮显示帮助她追踪自己的进步。
Next she plans to add two more bedrooms to her house and to work on enlarging her business.	接着，她计划为房子增加两个卧室并致力于拓展生意。
Fundación Paraguaya has been able to replicate this type of success in other parts of the world.	巴拉圭基金会能够在世界其他地区复制这一类型的成功。
In Tanzania, where I worked for three years in rural communities, we helped villages in the Southern Highlands adapt our poverty indicators to the local context in order to tackle water, sanitation, and electrification needs.	我在坦桑尼亚农村社区工作了三年，帮助南方高地（Southern Highlands）的村庄根据本地环境采取我们的贫困指标解决水、卫生和电气化需求。
Similar efforts are being deployed in South Africa, Nigeria, Uganda, China, and beyond.	南非、尼日利亚、乌干达、中国和其他国家也进行了类似的努力。
We could make even more progress with public-sector support.	如果有公共部门的支持，我们可以取得更大的进步。
Fundación Paraguaya collects rich data across multiple dimensions, tracking more than 8,700 families each year in Paraguay alone.	巴拉圭基金会收集了各个维度的丰富数据，光是在巴拉圭每年就要追踪8,700多户家庭。
If this information were to reach the government of Paraguay – which has its own methods for collecting data – we could identify pockets of poverty sooner and customize programs to help each family.	如果这一信息可以为巴拉圭政府所用 — — 它有其自身的收集数据方法 — — 我们可以更快确定贫困区域，为每户家庭制定个性化的帮助计划。
Because the information is self-reported, this sort of collaboration could deliver targeted aid and highlight specific public services that are needed.	由于信息为自我报告，这类合作能够实现定向援助，突显出所需要的具体的公共服务。
Moreover, if the World Bank’s Commission on Global Poverty adopts multidimensional poverty measures, it will spur other organizations to produce and share more detailed poverty data.	此外，如果世界银行全球贫困委员会采取多维度贫困衡量指标，将刺激其他组织收集和共享更加详细的贫困数据。
That will give aid workers a more comprehensive poverty map of the world, helping to boost the effectiveness of anti-poverty efforts everywhere.	这将让援助工作者获得更加全面的世界贫困地图，有助于提高世界各地扶贫措施的效果。
It won’t be easy to choose which measures to include, or even how to set universal yardsticks; but even adopting a few basic ones would spur progress.	要决定选择纳入那些指标绝非易事，甚至决定如何制定通用标准也不容易；但即使是采用一些最基本的指标也能刺激进步。
For too long, one-dimensional measures such as the $1.90 per day guideline have misdiagnosed poor people’s problems – and more importantly, their causes.	长期以来，每天1.90美元这样的一维指标误导我们对穷人的问题 — — 以及更重要的，问题的根源的认识。
We know that the $1.90 per day benchmark does not fully capture the struggles of poor people in places such as Paraguay.	我们知道，每天1.90美元的基准不能充分抓住巴拉圭等地区穷人的潦倒状况。
Fortunately, the World Bank now appears to recognize the limits of its income-based indicator.	幸运的是，如今世界银行似乎认识到其基于收入的指标的局限性。
Ensuring that the right type of aid reaches those most in need in a timely and effective manner requires development policymakers to embrace the type of multidimensional poverty data that aid organizations like Fundación Paraguaya have learned to gather.	确保正确的援助类型及时高效地到达最需要的人需要发展政策制定者采用巴拉圭基金会等组织已经学会收集的多维贫困数据类型。
	
The High Cost of “De-Risking” Infrastructure Finance	基础设施融资“去风险化”的高昂成本
OTTAWA – The World Bank and other multilateral institutions are increasingly promoting measures to “de-risk” infrastructure investments in developing countries, in order to make such projects more attractive for international finance.	渥太华—世界银行和其他多边机构日益推动发展中国家采取措施实现基础设施投资的“去风险化 ” ， 这是为了增加这些项目对国际融资的吸引力。
But “de-risking” is a misnomer: any project can be set back by external events, poor design, or mismanagement.	但“去风险化”的用词不当：任何项目都可能因为外部事件、设计不佳或管理不善而受挫。
At least some level of risk – whether stemming from human error and institutional weakness, or from earthquakes, hurricanes, and countless other sources – is inherent in all infrastructure investments.	至少一定水平的风险 — — 不管是来自人为失误或制度弱点，还是来自地震、飓风和其他各种原因 — — 是所有基础设施投资所固有的。
So the question is not how to eliminate risk, but rather how to allocate it between participating parties. When the World Bank and others talk about de-risking infrastructure finance, they really mean reducing the risk for investors – and increasing the risk for governments.	因此，问题不在于如何消除风险，而在于如何在参与方中间分配风险。
The proposed risk-allocation provisions for public-private partnerships contained in the World Bank’s Guidance on PPP Contractual Provisions, 2017 Edition take this approach to a new extreme.	世界银行的《PPP合同条款指南2017版 》 （ Guidance on PPP Contractual Provisions, 2017 Edition）包含了公私合作（PPP）的风险分配条款建议，其建议将这一方针用到了新的极致。
In almost any contingency – from “force majeure” to performance failures on the part of the private party – the public party is directed to assume all or a significant part of the risk.	在几乎所有或有情况中 — — 从“不可抗力”到私营方业绩失败 — — 公营方都被引导假定要承担全部或大部分风险。
Moreover, the Bank’s metric for determining the effectiveness of this unyielding approach is “successfully procured PPP transactions.”	此外，世行确定这一一刀切方针的效果的指标是“成功采购的PPP交易 。 ”
Missing is any measure of whether a project is actually providing the intended goods or services to citizens, and any mechanism for recourse if it is not.	完全没有任何指标去衡量一个项目是否向公民实际提供了意向商品或服务，如果答案是否定的，也没有任何机制追偿。
This extreme approach to risk allocation could have far-reaching consequences.	这一风险分配的极端方针可能产生重大后果。
A major reason why governments use PPPs in infrastructure is so that they can list such projects as “off-book.”	政府在基础设施中使用PPP的一个主要原因是这样一来它们可以将这些项目列为“表外 ” 。
That means the financing of the project is neither counted as a direct government capital expense nor applied against government debt ceilings.	这意味着项目融资不会算入直接政府资本支出，也无需受到政府债务上限约束。
And because a project’s costs are supposed to be paid out over time through direct user fees or operational funds furnished by the government, the capital expenditure is regarded as “free money” that governments need not account for.	而由于一个项目的成本应该通过直接用户费用或政府提供的运营资金逐渐支付，其资本支出被认为是“自有资金 ” ， 政府不必担责。
But financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund are now pushing back against this notion of “free money,” by pointing out that the higher the risk for a government, the less a project can be defined as “off-book.”	但国际货币基金组织（IMF）等金融机构现在正在反驳这一“自有资金”的概念，指出政府的风险越高，项目就越不能被定义为的“表外 ” 。
Accordingly, the World Bank’s lopsided risk-allocation provisions should actually make it more likely that PPP projects will have to be categorized as on-book financing and debt.	据此，世界银行的有失偏颇的风险分配条款实际上应该让PPP项目更多地必须归类为表内融资和债务。
That would be a good thing in itself.	这件事本身是一件好事。
By listing all infrastructure projects as on-book, governments will be in a better position to test whether they are delivering real value for money.	将所有基础设施项目列为表内将是政府能够更好地考察它们是否实现了资金的真正价值。
The problem is that these discussions are all happening behind the scenes.	问题在于这些套路都是在幕后进行的。
In the meantime, the World Bank has continued to promote PPPs as the only acceptable form of infrastructure financing for developing countries in cases where a private party can do the job.	与此同时，世界银行继续推销PPP为发展中国家唯一可接受的私营方可以做出贡献的基础设施投资形式。
And governments have continued to accumulate ever more risk, on the assumption that it is off-book and thus not counted as a sovereign-debt obligation.	而政府则不断地积累更多风险，它们的假设是这是表外项目，因此不计入主权债务。
As a result, many developing countries are now heading for a doomsday scenario.	结果，许多发展中国家现在走向了末日情景。
The risks that governments have taken on will last 20-30 years in many cases.	在很多例子中，政府所承担的风险会持续二三十年。
During that time, governments will face severe challenges in managing public expenditures, and they will incur unforeseen costs related to off-book commitments and excessive debt, raising the possibility of a default on all credit commitments.	在此期间，政府将面临严重的挑战，包括管理公共支出等，还会导致与表外承诺和过度负债有关的预料之外的成本，提高所有信用承诺的违约概率。
Making matters worse, the World Bank’s current approach creates moral hazard: the less risk the private party in a PPP assumes, the less it has to lose from poor performance.	更糟糕的是，世界银行的当前方针造成了道德风险：私营方在PPP中承担的风险越低，其因表现不佳而遭致的损失就越小。
The Bank’s guidance provisions stipulate that even a private-sector partner that has failed to deliver must be compensated in order for a government to terminate the contract.	世界银行的指南条款规定，即使是没有达到效果的公私合作项目，私营方也必须得到补偿，这样政府才能终止合同。
As a result, some private-sector contractors may not assume that they have to perform well; instead, they may constantly weigh the costs and benefits of doing mediocre or poor-quality work.	结果，一些私营承包商将认为自己无需拿出优异的表现；相反，它们可能会一直评估表现平庸甚至低劣的成本与收益。
The current approach is also an open invitation for private parties to squeeze governments even further, by renegotiating active contracts.	当前的方针也是在公开邀请私营方通过重新谈判合同而进一步挤出政府。
Faced with absorbing the full costs of a failed project or paying more to ensure that it succeeds, a government has little choice but to accede to a private-sector partner’s demands.	因为必须吸收项目失败的全部成本，或支付更多以保证项目成功，政府将别无选择，只能向私营方的要求妥协。
This is not a far-fetched risk.	这绝非牵强附会的风险。
The World Bank and others have understood for years that private companies frequently initiate contract renegotiations in PPP infrastructure projects.	世界银行和其他机构多年来早已明白，PPP基础设施中的私营公司频繁发起合同重新谈判。
And this is even more likely to happen when contracts are awarded in a context of imperfect competition, which creates opportunities for private companies to set unrealistic contract terms.	而如果合同在不完全竞争的环境下授予 — — 从而私营公司有机会设定不现实的合同条款 — — 这样的可能性还会更大。
No doubt, the World Bank has good intentions.	毫无疑问，世界银行的初衷是好的。
But pushing all of the risk onto governments is not the way to attract investment in developing countries.	但将所有的风险都分配给政府绝非为发展中国家吸引投资指导。
The Bank urgently needs to reverse course.	世界银行急需改变策略。
That means promoting balanced risk allocations and ensuring that all infrastructure projects are assessed as if they were on-book.	这意味着推动平衡的风险分配，确保所有基础设施项目都作为表内项目进行评估。
Guidance that is blind to its own consequences is not helpful.	无视其自身后果的指南无济于事。
And when it is offered to developing countries that already have unsustainable sovereign debts, it is downright dangerous.	而把这些指南提供给主权债务已然不可持续的发展中国家显然是极其危险的。
	
Can the World Bank Redeem Itself?	世界银行能实现自我救赎吗？
CAMBRIDGE – In recent years, as the World Bank’s financing role has been eclipsed by the rise of private capital and a surge in money from China, its leaders have been desperately seeking a new mission.	发自剑桥 — — 随着这几年私人资本崛起以及来自中国的资金激增，世界银行的融资角色已经黯然失色，其领导人一直在想方设法寻求新的使命。
And interminable reorganizations, politicized appointments, and the changing priorities of successive presidents have contributed to the perception that the institution is less than functional.	然而无休止的重组，政治化的人事任命以及历任总裁不断更改的优先事项都使人们认为该机构已经不具备实用性。
But can that change?	那么这一切能有所改变吗？
The World Bank has tried to reinvent itself as a supplier of global public goods and a “knowledge bank” that provides data, analysis, and research to its developing-country clients.	世界银行一直试图将自身重塑为一个全球公共产品供应商以及为其发展中国家客户提供数据，分析和研究的“知识库 ” 。
And few would deny the Bank’s achievements when it comes to gathering indicators of economic activity, measuring poverty, identifying deficiencies in the provision of health and education, and, in earlier years, designing and evaluating development projects.	同时该机构在收集经济活动指标，衡量贫困程度，揭示健康和教育供应短缺状况，以及在早些年设计和评估发展项目方面所取得的成就也是举世公认的。
But many, such as the Nobel laureate economist Angus Deaton, have criticized the World Bank’s overall performance.	但也有许多人，比如诺贝尔经济学奖获得者安格斯·迪顿（Angus Deaton ） ， 对世界银行的整体表现提出了批评。
One problem is that development outcomes also depend on poor countries’ external economic environment, which is shaped by the policies of the major economies.	一个问题在于发展成果还取决于贫穷国家的外部经济环境，而后者又是由主要经济体的政策所决定的。
And when it comes to promoting sound policies, the World Bank has fallen far short in recent decades, exemplified by three major intellectual sins of omission.	同时在近几十年间世界银行在推动合理健全的政策方面已经远远落后，特别是出现了三起在智识上的重大疏忽事件。
The first relates to the World Bank’s role in the Latin American debt crisis of the early 1980s.	第一件涉及到世界银行在1980年代初期拉美债务危机中所扮演的角色。
As its official history shows, the Bank restricted research on the implications of excessive borrowing during the crisis.	正如其官方历史记录所示，世行限制了针对危机期间过度借贷影响的研究。
Moreover, it did little to make the case for debt write-downs, despite the reckless increase in lending by big banks.	此外尽管各个大型银行都在不顾一切地增加贷款，但它在要求债务减记方面却鲜有作为。
Instead, through its structural-adjustment lending, the World Bank, along with the International Monetary Fund, effectively became a debt collector for creditors.	相反，通过其结构调整型贷款，世界银行和国际货币基金组织实际上成为了债权人的债务催收员。
The result was a lost decade for Latin America, but not for the bankers.	结果是拉丁美洲失去了十年，而银行家们却全身而退。
The resulting moral hazard would encourage another bout of exuberant lending, which led to further financial crises in developing countries in the subsequent decade.	由此产生的道德风险又激励了另一轮大干快上的贷款，进一步推动了发展中国家在随后十年中多次爆发金融危机。
The World Bank was also silent when its developing-country clients’ access to life-saving medications was being restricted.	当其发展中国家客户在救命药物方面受到限制时，世界银行也保持了沉默。
In the late 1980s, the leading industrialized countries – the United States, Europe, and Japan – began to push for stronger patent regimes that would boost their own pharmaceutical companies’ profits.	在1980年代末各主要工业化国家 — — 美国，欧洲和日本 — — 开始推动更强势的专利制度以提高本国制药公司的利润。
In 1995, developing countries were forced to sign the onerous Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreement at the World Trade Organization.	1995年，发展中国家被迫在世界贸易组织框架内签署了繁重苛刻的《与贸易有关的知识产权协定 》 。
Moreover, under Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974, sanctions were imposed on several developing countries, from Chile to India, accused of failing to strengthen patent protections sufficiently.	此外还根据1974年《美国贸易法案》第301条对从智利到印度的多个被指控未能充分加强专利保护的发展中国家实施制裁。
Even when the AIDS crisis was ravaging Sub-Saharan Africa in the early 2000s, global patent rules were not just maintained, but actually tightened further, until pressure from civil society finally forced the expansion of access to affordable treatment.	即便是艾滋病危机在21世纪初肆虐撒哈拉以南非洲地区之时，全球专利规则也不仅得到了维持，甚至实际上进一步收紧，直到民间社会的压力最终迫使获取可负担治疗的渠道得以扩大才告一段落。
The World Bank, however, said little.	然而世界银行对此却惜字如金。
This brings us to the World Bank’s third failure, the consequences of which are unfolding today.	这就把我们引向了世界银行的第三项失误 — — 而其后果眼下正在徐徐展现。
During much of the 1980s and 1990s, the Bank oversaw structural adjustment programs in developing countries that focused on deregulation, privatization, and economic liberalization, especially trade opening, all of which helped to enable globalization.	在1980年代和1990年代的大部分时间里，世界银行监督发展中国家实施的结构调整方案重点都在于放松管制，私有化和经济自由化，尤其是贸易开放，所有这一切都有助于全球化的实现。
While there were undoubtedly problems with many aspects of such a one-size-fit-all package of policies – the Washington Consensus, as it was known – the trade liberalization component helped accelerate lower-middle-income and middle-income countries’ economic convergence with developed countries.	虽然这种一刀切式的一揽子政策 — — 就是众所周知的华盛顿共识 — — 无疑在许多方面都存在着问题，但其与贸易自由化相关的要件有助于加速缩小中低收入国家和中等收入国家与发达国家之间的经济差距。
But, today, the United States is rejecting trade openness, imposing unilateral tariffs and other barriers, and renegotiating trade deals on worse terms.	但如今美国开始抵制贸易开放并强行施加单边关税及其他障碍，并祭出更糟糕的条件来重新谈判贸易协议。
And the World Bank’s silence is deafening.	而世界银行对此简直陷入了死一般的沉默。
Its senior leadership has said nothing about the serious threat posed by the actions of the US or of other major players.	其高级领导层对美国或其他主要参与者的行径所构成的严重威胁三缄其口。
While the Bank’s annual report, released in September, talks of a commitment to “researching today’s most pressing topics,” trade is not among them.	虽然该行于9月发布的年度报告谈到了“研究当前最紧迫话题”的承诺，但贸易竟不在其中。
This is not just some oversight; during all of these episodes, the Bank knew that its responsibility was to act as an advocate for its poor clients. Instead, it decided – every time – to kowtow to its most powerful shareholders and their vested interests (such as Big Pharma and the financial industry), arguably in exchange for additional resources for its soft-loan window (the International Development Association) and, less frequently, capital increases for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and International Finance Corporation.	这可不仅仅是疏忽；在所有这些事件中，世行知道自己责任是要为那些贫穷国家客户争取权益，但它却决定 — — 而且是无一例外地 — — 向那些最有权势的股东及其既得利益者（如大型制药公司和金融业）俯首称臣，据说是为其软贷款窗口（国际发展协会）换取额外资源以及（不那么频繁地）为国际复兴开发银行和国际金融公司增加资本。
For example, this April – after the US had launched its trade war with tariffs on steel and aluminum – the Development Committee of the World Bank Board of Governors endorsed a package that included a $7.5 billion paid-in capital increase for the IBRD.	例如，今年4月 — — 在美国利用钢铁和铝关税发起贸易战后 — — 世界银行理事会发展委员会批准了一揽子计划，其中包括为国际复兴开发银行增加75亿美元的实收资本。
This required the support of President Donald Trump’s administration, leading to silence from the Bank until June, when it finally warned of the negative impact of trade protectionism on global growth.	为了换取特朗普总统政府的支持世界银行一直对贸易战保持沉默，直到6月才终于对贸易保护主义对全球增长的负面影响发出警告。
One might wonder whether such a Faustian bargain could be worthwhile if it means that the World Bank has more resources to promote development in poor countries.	人们可能会思考如果这意味着世界银行能有更多资源来促进贫穷国家的发展，那么这种类似浮士德与魔鬼交易的做法是否也值得一试。
But while money certainly matters, the evidence suggests that development outcomes are determined more by factors like state capacity and national policies, and crucially, a supportive global environment.	资金固然重要，但有证据表明，发展的成果其实更多地取决于国家能力和国家政策等因素，更重要的是要有一个起到支持作用的全球环境。
Rising trade protectionism, tighter immigration policies, and a lack of action on climate change by the world’s biggest economic players – particularly the US – thus pose serious threats to development, which a little extra money for the World Bank cannot offset.	全球最大的经济参与者 — — 特别是美国 — — 不断上升的贸易保护主义，更严格的移民政策以及对气候变化的无动于衷已经对发展构成了严重威胁，这是世界银行所获得的额外资金所无法抵消的。
The ends do not justify the means: money may not matter that much, while ideas matter immensely in the broader fight against poverty (as this year’s Nobel Economics laureate, Paul Romer, has shown).	其实结果无法证明手段的正当性：资金可能并不是那么重要，而理念则会在更广泛的反贫困斗争中起到极为关键的作用 — — 正如今年的诺贝尔经济学奖获得者保罗·罗默（Paul Romer）所表明的那样。
The World Bank cannot erase its troubling history of silence.	世界银行无法抹去其令人不安的沉默历史。
But it may be able to redeem itself.	但它或许能够实现自我救赎。
Its new chief economist is an expert on trade. The Bank’s leadership should empower her to lead the charge in making the intellectual case for open markets for goods, services, and people.	其新任首席经济学家是贸易专家，而世界银行的领导层应该授权她去为商品，服务和人员的开放市场做出明智的指引。
The World Bank is well aware that its mission – “to reduce poverty, and improve living standards by promoting sustainable growth and investment in people” – cannot be achieved without an open global system.	世界银行清楚地意识到，如果没有开放的全球体系，它的使命 — — “通过促进可持续增长以及对人的投资来减少贫困，提高生活水平 ” — —是不可能实现的。
If it chooses not to uphold a core tenet of its mission, and instead continues to try ingratiating itself with its largest shareholders, it will not only fail its clients throughout the developing world; it will also lose whatever is left of its raison d’être.	如果它选择不去坚持其使命的核心原则，而是继续尝试讨好其最大的股东，那么它不仅会辜负那些发展中国家客户；也将失去其存在的理由。
	
The Sky Is Not Falling	天并没有塌下来
VIENNA – Humans are partial to bad news.	维也纳 — — 人类更愿意相信坏消息。
Media outlets reflect and shape this preference, feeding us woe and panic.	媒体渠道反映并迎合这种偏好，为我们带来悲伤和恐惧。
Long, slow, positive trends don’t make it to the front page or to water-cooler conversations.	缓慢而积极的长期趋势不会出现在头版头条，也不会成为人们茶余饭后的谈资。
So we develop peculiar misperceptions, especially the idea that a preponderance of things are going wrong.	因此我们发展出特殊的误解，尤其认为绝大多数领域都在出现问题。
When I published The Skeptical Environmentalist in 2001, I pointed out that the world was getting better in many respects.	2001年我出版充满怀疑的环保主义者时，就曾指出世界在许多方面都取得了进步。
Back then, this was viewed as heresy, as it punctured several common and cherished misperceptions, such as the idea that natural resources were running out, that an ever-growing population was leaving less to eat, and that air and water were becoming ever-more polluted.	我的观点在当时就被视为异端邪说，因为它戳穿了几项被人们普遍接受的错误认知，如认为自然资源正在枯竭、不断增长的人口正在导致粮食短缺，而空气和水污染所造成严重问题正变得越来越严重。
In each case, careful examination of the data established that the gloomy scenarios prevailing at the time were exaggerated.	在所有情况下，认真审视数据都会发现夸大了当时流行一时的悲观情绪。
While fish stocks, for example, are depleted because of a lack of regulation, we can actually eat more fish than ever, thanks to the advent of aquaculture.	例如，尽管缺乏监管正导致鱼类资源陷入枯竭，但多亏水产养殖业的发展，实际我们却可以吃到比以往更多的鱼。
Worries that we are losing forests overlook the reality that as countries become richer, they increase their forest cover.	担心森林正在消失的忧虑忽视了这样一个现实，那就是越来越富裕的国家增加了森林覆盖率。
Since I wrote the book, the world has only become better, according to many important indicators.	写完这本书后，据许多重要指标显示，世界已经取得了持续的进步。
We have continued to see meaningful reductions in infant mortality and malnutrition, and there have been massive strides toward eradication of polio, measles, malaria, and illiteracy.	我们继续目睹婴儿死亡率和营养不良率大幅降低，而且巨大的进展发生在消灭小儿麻痹、麻疹、疟疾和文盲等领域。
By focusing on the most lethal environmental problem – air pollution – we can see some of the reasons for improvement.	通过重点研究最致命的环境问题 — — 空气污染 — — 我们可以找到一些进步的原因和理由。
As the world developed, deaths from air pollution have declined dramatically, and that trend is likely to continue.	随着世界的发展，空气污染造成的死亡急剧下降，而这种趋势很有可能会延续下去。
Looking at a polluted city in a country like China might suggest otherwise, but the air inside the homes of most poor people is about ten times more polluted than the worst outdoor air in Beijing.	单看中国等国家的受污染城市可能得出不同的结论，但多数贫困民众的室内污染比北京最严重的室外空气污染要差十倍。
The most serious environmental problem for humans is indoor air pollution from cooking and heating with dirty fuels like wood and dung – which is the result of poverty.	对人类而言，最严重的环境问题是利用木材和牛粪等肮脏燃料烹饪和取暖所造成的室内空气污染 — — 而这种污染来源于贫困。
In 1900, more than 90% of all air pollution deaths resulted from indoor air pollution.	1900年，空气污染死亡率的90%以上来自室内空气污染。
Economic development has meant more outdoor pollution, but also much less indoor pollution.	经济发展恶化了室外空气污染，但同时也导致室内污染大幅降低。
Reductions in poverty have gone hand in hand with a four-fold reduction in global air pollution mortality.	经济发展在减贫的同时导致全球空气污染死亡率降低了4倍。
Yet more people today still die from indoor air pollution than from outdoor pollution.	而今天室内空气污染仍然比室外污染致死的人更多。
Even in China, while outside air has become a lot more polluted, poverty reduction has caused a lower risk of total air pollution death.	即使中国的室外空气污染进一步加重，但减贫仍然导致空气污染死亡的总体风险降低。
And as countries become richer, they can afford to regulate and cut even outdoor air pollution.	而随着国家变得越来越富，甚至就连室外空气污染他们都有能力监管和控制。
Two hundred years ago, almost every person on the planet lived in poverty, and a tiny elite in luxury.	200年前，地球上几乎所有人口都陷于贫困，只有一小撮精英才能享受奢侈。
Today just 9.1% of the population, or almost 700 million people, lives on less than $1.90 per day (or what used to be one dollar in 1985).	而今天，仅总人口的9.1 % ， 也就是差不多7亿，每天仅靠不足1.9美元生活（1985年这一数字曾仅有一美元左右 ） 。
And just in the last 20 years, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty has almost halved.	而在过去20年中生活在极端贫困中的人口比例几乎减少近半。
Yet few of us know this.	但鲜有人知道这样的事实。
The Gapminder foundation surveyed the UK and found that just 10% of people believe poverty has decreased.	Gapminder基金会对英国进行了调查，发现认为贫困减少的人仅占10 % 。
In South Africa and in Sweden, more people believe extreme poverty has doubled than believe – correctly – that it has plummeted.	在南非和瑞典，更多人相信极端贫困翻了一番，而并不相信极端贫困已经大幅减少的事实。
How do we continue our swift progress?	我们怎样才能快速发展下去？
There has been no shortage of well-intentioned policy interventions, so we have decades of data showing what works well and what doesn’t.	人类从不缺少善意的政策干预，因此我们有几十年的资料显示哪些措施行之有效，哪些则不是。
In the latter category, even well-considered ideas from the world’s most eminent thinkers can fall short.	在后一种类别中，即使世界最杰出思想家深思熟虑的想法也有可能出错。
The ambitious Millennium Villages concept was supposed to create simultaneous progress on multiple fronts, producing “major results in three or fewer years,” according to founder Jeffrey D. Sachs.	按照创始人杰弗里·萨克斯的说法，雄心勃勃的千禧村概念本应在多方面同时取得进展 ， “ 用三年或者更少的时间创造出重大的成果 ” 。
But a study by the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development shows the villages had “moderately positive impacts,” and “little overall impact on poverty.”	但英国国际发展部的一项研究表明千禧村仅产生了“微弱的积极效应 ” ， 而对“消除贫困的整体影响不大 ” 。
It’s more constructive to focus on what works.	更具建设性的方法是关注有效的举措。
Global analysis of development targets for Copenhagen Consensus by a panel of Nobel laureate economists showed where more money can achieve the most.	由诺贝尔经济学奖获得者组成的专家小组对哥本哈根共识发展目标的全球分析表明在哪些领域投资可以取得最大的成果。
They concluded that improved access to contraception and family-planning services would reduce maternal and child mortality, and also – through a demographic dividend – increase economic growth.	他们的结论是加强避孕和计划生育服务能降低孕产妇和儿童的死亡率，并同时 — — 通过人口红利 — — 推动经济增长。
Likewise, research assessing the best development policies for Haiti found that focusing on improvements in nutrition through the use of fortified flour would transform the health of young children, creating lifelong benefits.	同样，评估海地最佳发展政策的研究发现通过使用强化面粉重点改善营养能够彻底改变幼儿的健康状况，并终身为其带来好处。
Other Copenhagen Consensus research suggests that scaling up government e-procurement platforms would be transformative.	其他哥本哈根共识研究表明扩大政府采购平台将带来革命性效果。
This may sound tangential to poverty reduction, but it’s not.	这听上去似乎与减贫无关，但实际情况却不是这样。
On average, developing countries use half their budgets on procurement; enabling transparent competition could reduce losses caused by corruption.	平均而言，发展中国家将预算的一半用于采购，创造透明的竞争环境可以减少腐败造成的损失。
This is not mere speculation.	这绝不仅仅是无端的猜测。
A case study in Bangladesh, which spends more than $9 billion on public procurement annually, found that piloting e-procurement in just one government department lowered prices by 12%, leaving more resources for other important budget priorities.	针对孟加拉国每年在公共采购上花费超过90亿美元的一项案例研究显示，仅在一个政府部门试行电子采购就降低了12%的价格，从而可以将节省下来的更多资源用于其他重要的预算事项。
The research shows that expanding digital procurement government-wide would save $670 million annually – enough to increase annual public-health spending by about 50%.	研究表明在整个政府范围内实现数字采购每年可以节约6.7亿美元 — — 足以增加50%的年度公共卫生支出。
The Bangladeshi government is now fast-tracking this expansion.	孟加拉国政府现在正在抓紧推广电子采购工作。
And the most powerful weapon in the fight against poverty is the one that got us where we are today: broad-based economic growth.	与贫困作斗争最有力的武器让我们取得了今天经济普遍增长的伟大成就。
Over the past 30 years, China’s growth spurt alone lifted an unprecedented 680 million people above the poverty line.	过去30年，仅中国的经济发展井喷就实现了前所未有的6.8亿人脱贫致富。
A global trade agreement – such as a successful conclusion to the stalled Doha Round – would lift another 160 million people out of poverty.	达成全球贸易协议 — — 如圆满结束停滞不前的多哈回合谈判 — — 将使另外1.6亿人脱贫致富。
Skepticism toward free trade hurts the world’s poorest.	怀疑自由贸易会损害世界最贫困的民众。
While other US policies and tweets by President Donald Trump get far more coverage, the current administration’s rejection of free trade could be the biggest tragedy.	尽管唐纳德·特朗普总统其他的美国政策和推文吸引了更多的媒体关注，但现政府拒绝自由贸易可能拉开了最大悲剧的序幕。
Humanity’s success in reducing poverty is an extraordinary achievement, and one that we are far too reticent about acknowledging.	人类减贫成功是一项了不起的成就，我们对这方面的认识还远远不足。
We need to make sure that we don’t lose sight of what got us this far – and what justifies the hope of an even better future.	我们必须确保了解上述成就的来源 — — 以及什么才能使我们的未来更加充满希望。
	
The World Economy in 2018	2018年的世界经济
STANFORD – All major macroeconomic indicators – growth, unemployment, and inflation – suggest that 2017 will be the American economy’s best year in a decade.	发自斯坦福 — — 所有主要的宏观经济指标 — — 增长，失业率和通胀率 — — 都表明2017年将是美国经济十年来最好的一年。
And the global economy is enjoying broad, synchronized growth beyond what anyone expected.	全球经济也正享受着超出所有人预期的，广泛而同步的增长。
The question now is whether this strong performance will continue in 2018.	而如今的问题这在于：这个强劲表现能否在2018年延续下去。
The answer, of course, will depend on monetary, fiscal, trade, and related policies in the United States and around the world.	答案无疑将取决于美国和全球各国的货币，财政，贸易等相关政策。
And yet it is hard to predict what policy proposals will emerge in 2018.	但2018年会出现哪些政策议案是很难预测的。
There are relatively new heads of state in the US, France, and the United Kingdom; German leaders still have not formed a governing coalition since the general election in September; and the US Federal Reserve has a new chair awaiting confirmation.	美法英三国都有了新的国家元首，德国领导人在9月份大选后尚未组成执政联盟；美联储的新主席人选还有待确认。
Moreover, major changes in important developing economies such as Argentina, Saudi Arabia, and Brazil have made the future outlook even murkier.	同时阿根廷，沙特，巴西等重要发展中经济体国内局势的重大变化也使得前景更加阴暗难猜。
Still, we should hope for the best.	不过我们依然会满怀希望。
First and foremost, we should hope that synchronized global growth at a rate of just under 4% will continue in 2018, as the International Monetary Fund projected in October.	首先，如国际货币基金组织10月预测的那样，我们可以指望略低于4％的全球经济同步增长率能在2018年得以延续。
Growth not only raises incomes, but also makes vexing problems such as bad bank loans and budget deficits more manageable.	经济增长不仅提高了收入，还能使银行不良贷款，预算赤字等问题更加容易应对。
As former US President John F. Kennedy famously said in an October 1963 speech in which he promoted his proposed corporate and personal tax reductions, “a rising tide lifts all boats.”	正如美国前总统约翰·F·肯尼迪（John F. Kennedy）在1963年10月一次提议降低企业和个人税率的演讲中所说的那样 ： “ 潮水一涨，万帆皆高 ” 。
For my part, I predict that the global recovery will continue, but at a slightly slower growth rate of around 3.5%.	在我看来，全球经济复苏将持续，但增速略低，大概在3.5％左右。
The two most obvious risks to keep an eye on will be Europe, where a cyclical upturn could stall, and the oil-rich Middle East, where tensions could flare up once again.	最需要注意的两个最明显风险一个是周期性好转局面可能出现停滞的欧洲，以及紧张局势可能再次爆发中东产油区。
Second, let us hope that the Fed, guided by the steady hand of its new chair, Jerome “Jay” Powell, will continue or even accelerate its monetary-policy normalization, both by raising its benchmark federal funds rate, and by shrinking its engorged balance sheet.	其次，让我们希望美联储能在其新主席杰罗姆·鲍威尔（Jerome Powell）的稳定执掌下继续或甚至加快其货币政策正常化进程，一方面提高基准联邦基金利率，另一方面收缩其过度膨胀的资产负债表。
And we should hope that economic conditions allow the other major central banks, especially the European Central Bank, to follow suit.	我们也希望经济条件能允许其他主要央行（尤其是欧洲央行）效仿这些举动。
On this front, I predict that the major central banks will continue to normalize monetary policies more gradually than is necessary.	在这方面，我预计各主要央行将会继续逐步实现货币政策正常化。
The biggest risk here is that markets may try to test the Fed under its new leadership, for example, if inflation rises faster than anticipated.	这里最大的风险在于市场可能试图考验一下新领导人治下的美联储，比如如果通胀上涨速度可能超出预期。
Third, let us hope that the Republican tax package will, if enacted, deliver on its promise of increased investment, output, productivity, and wages over the coming decade.	第三，我们希望共和党的一揽子税收方案能够在未来十年内兑现其提升投资，产出，生产力和工资的承诺。
Here, I predict that the legislation will pass, and that investment in the US over the next few years will be relatively higher than if no action had been taken.	在此我预测立法会通过，而未来几年的对美投资会比不做出任何行动要高。
To be sure, whether investment will rise from its currently subdued level will depend on many other factors than the corporate-tax rate.	可以肯定的是，投资能否摆脱当前的低迷水平还得取决于企业税率以外的其他因素。
But the tax package can still be expected to boost output, productivity, and wages.	但税收方案仍然可以提高产出，生产率和工资。
The question is not if, but when.	问题不在于能否，而是何时。
If the full effects of the legislation are not felt before the 2018 or 2020 elections, that lag could prove politically consequential.	如果立法效应无法在2018年或2020年选举之前全部释放，那么这种滞后可能会产生一定的政治后果。
The biggest danger is that its benefits will be delayed, and that its key provisions will be reversed whenever the Democrats are back in power.	最大的危险在于它的正面效应将会被延后，而其主要条款将会被重夺政权的民主党人所逆转。
Fourth, let us hope that governments everywhere begin to address the looming crisis in public-pension and health-care costs, which have been rising for decades.	第四，让我们希望各地的政府都开始着手解决一项迫在眉睫的危机：几十年来一直在上升的公共养老金和医疗保健成本。
As social programs become costlier, they crowd out government expenditures on necessities such as defense, while generating ever more pressure to impose higher growth-suppressing taxes.	随着社会项目的成本日益上涨，国防等必需品的政府支出遭到了挤占，也令到压抑增长的加税压力不断增大。
Europe, in particular, must not let its cyclical rebound lull it into complacency.	欧洲尤其避免在周期性反弹下保持清醒。
Many European Union member states still need to reduce their government debt, and the eurozone needs to resolve its “zombie bank” crisis.	许多欧盟成员国仍需缩减政府债务，欧元区则得着手解决“僵尸银行”危机。
Beyond that, structural labor-market reforms of the kind French President Emmanuel Macron is pursuing would be most welcome.	除此之外，法国总统马克龙所追求的结构性劳动力市场改革也是最为急需的。
Unfortunately, I’m afraid that progress on structural reforms will be sporadic, at best.	不幸的是我担心结构改革的进展恐怕会是断断续续的。
The danger is that slow growth will not lead to sufficient wage gains and job creation to defuse the ticking time bomb of high youth unemployment in many countries.	危险在于缓慢增长无法带来足够的工资收入增长和就业增量以化解许多国家的高青年失业率定时炸弹。
Another risk is that reform attempts could provoke a political backlash that would be harmful to long-term investment.	另一项风险在于改革尝试可能会引发一场不利于长期性投资的政治反弹。
Fifth, let us hope that the eurozone can avoid a currency crisis.	第五，希望欧元区能避免货币危机。
This will depend largely on whether German Chancellor Angela Merkel can form a coalition government and restore political stability to Europe’s largest economy.	这在很大程度上取决于德国总理默克尔能否组建联合政府，让德国这个欧洲最大经济体恢复政治稳定。
Sixth, we should hope that the EU and the UK can agree on a reasonable Brexit deal that will preserve fairly strong trade relations.	第六，我们应寄望欧盟和英国能达成一个合理的脱欧协议以维护双方之间的密切贸易关系。
The main risk here is that localized declines in trade could spill over and cause broader harm.	这里的主要风险是贸易的局部下降可能会蔓延开来并造成更广泛的伤害。
And, beyond Europe, let us hope that negotiations between the US, Canada, and Mexico over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will result in an arrangement that still facilitates continental trade.	而在欧洲之外，我们希望美国，加拿大和墨西哥三国之间就《北美自由贸易协定》进行的谈判将产生一个仍然有利于北美大陆贸易的安排。
For trade generally, the biggest risk is that the Trump administration could start a lose-lose trade dispute, owing to its understandable eagerness to help American manufacturing workers.	对于贸易来说，最大的风险在于特朗普政府会因为急于扶助美国制造业劳动者而发起一场双输的贸易争端。
Seventh, let us hope that new policies targeting information and communication technology (ICT) strike the right balance among all stakeholders’ competing and legitimate concerns.	第七，让我们希望以信息和通信技术为目标的新政策能够在所有利益相关者的竞争和合理关切之间取得适当的平衡。
On one hand, there is reason to worry about certain Internet companies’ concentration of market power, particularly in online content and distribution, and about the effects of new technologies on personal privacy, law enforcement, and national security.	一方面，有理由担心某些互联网公司在某些市场 — — 特别是在线内容和分发方面 — — 攫取过大权力，以及新技术对个人隐私，执法和国家安全的影响。
On the other hand, new technological advances could deliver immense economic gains.	另一方面，新技术进步的巨大经济收益也不容忽视。
It is easy to envision a scenario of too much regulation, or of too little.	监管过多或过少的状况可能出现。
It is also easy to envision a large-scale public backlash against the major technology companies, particularly if poor self-policing or a refusal to cooperate with law enforcement leads to some horrible event.	特别是在因自我管理不善或拒绝配合执法而导致一些可怕事件后，公众针对大型科技公司实施大规模反弹也是有可能的。
Here, I predict that achieving an appropriate policy balance will take years.	在此我预测达致适当的政策平衡将需要几年的时间。
If some future event strikes an emotional chord, the public’s mood could swing dramatically.	如果未来的事件引发情绪上的共鸣，公众的情绪就会剧烈波动。
Ultimately, however, I suspect that competition and innovation will survive the forthcoming regulations.	但我觉得竞争和创新还是可以在即将到来的法规监管中找到生存空间。
Finally, and most important, let us hope that terrorism is thwarted everywhere, conflicts subside, democracy and capitalism regain some momentum, and greater civility and honest dialogue return to the public domain.	最后，也是最重要的是，让我们希望，各地的恐怖主义都能被挫败，冲突消退，民主与资本主义能恢复一些前进的势头，更大范围的文明与诚实的对话能回归公共领域。
Should that happen in 2018, it will be a very good year indeed.	如果这一切能在2018年发生，那这将是非常好的一年。
	
The World Economy Without China	没有中国的世界经济
NEW HAVEN – Is the Chinese economy about to implode?	纽黑文—中国经济快要崩溃了吗？
With its debt overhangs and property bubbles, its zombie state-owned enterprises and struggling banks, China is increasingly portrayed as the next disaster in a crisis-prone world.	债务堆积和房地产泡沫、国企僵尸化、银行步履维艰，中国被越来越多的人描述成危机重重的世界中的下一场灾难。
I remain convinced that such fears are overblown, and that China has the strategy, wherewithal, and commitment to achieve a dramatic structural transformation into a services-based consumer society while successfully dodging daunting cyclical headwinds.	我仍然这些担心有些杞人忧天，中国有战略、能力和决心实现伟大的结构转型，成为以服务为基础的消费社会，同时成功地规避巨大的周期性困难。
But I certainly recognize that this is now a minority opinion.	但我当然也知道目前这是少数人的观点。
For example, US Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew continues to express the rather puzzling view that the United States “can’t be the only engine in the world economy.”	比如，美国财政部长雅各布·卢仍然持有相当令人难以理解的观点：美国“无法成为世界经济唯一的引擎 。 ”
Actually, it’s not: the Chinese economy is on track to contribute well over four times as much to global growth as the US this year.	事实上它也不是：今年中国经济对全球增长的贡献很有可能是美国的四倍有余。
But maybe Lew is already assuming the worst for China in his assessment of the world economy.	但也许卢已经在其对世界经济的评估中假设了中国遭遇最坏情形。
So what if the China doubters are right?	那么，如果中国怀疑论者是对的，情况会如何？
What if China’s economy does indeed come crashing down, with its growth rate plunging into low single digits, or even negative territory, as would be the case in most crisis economies?	如果中国经济确实正在走向崩溃，其增长如大部分危机经济体一样下降至极低水平乃至负区间，情况会如何？
China would suffer, of course, but so would an already-shaky global economy.	固然中国不好受，但已经岌岌可危的全球经济亦然。
With all the handwringing over the Chinese economy, it’s worth considering this thought experiment in detail.	在关于中国经济的重重绝望中，有必要详细思考这一思想实验。
For starters, without China, the world economy would already be in recession.	首先，没有中国，世界经济已经进入了衰退。
China’s growth rate this year appears set to hit 6.7% – considerably higher than most forecasters have been expecting.	今年中国经济增长率可能为6.7 % — —比大部分预测家的预期显著更高。
According to the International Monetary Fund – the official arbiter of global economic metrics – the Chinese economy accounts for 17.3% of world GDP (measured on a purchasing-power-parity basis).	据全球经济指标官方“仲裁官 ” — —国际货币基金组织（IMF ） ， 中国经济贡献世界GDP的17.3 % （ 以购买力平价衡量 ） 。
A 6.7% increase in Chinese real GDP thus translates into about 1.2 percentage points of world growth. Absent China, that contribution would need to be subtracted from the IMF’s downwardly revised 3.1% estimate for world GDP growth in 2016, dragging it down to 1.9% – well below the 2.5% threshold commonly associated with global recessions.	如果没有中国，这一贡献需要从IMF向下修正的2016年世界GDP增长预测（3.1 % ） 中剔除，将世界GDP增长率拉低至1.9 % — —大大低于通常伴随全球衰退出现的阈值2.5 % 。
Of course, that’s just the direct effect of a world without China.	当然，这只是没有中国的世界的直接影响。
Then there are cross-border linkages with other major economies.	接下来要考虑的是中国与其他主要经济体的跨国联系。
The so-called resource economies – namely, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Russia, and Brazil – would be hit especially hard.	所谓的资源经济体 — — 即澳大利亚、新西兰、加拿大、俄罗斯和巴西 — — 都将遭受重创。
As a resource-intensive growth juggernaut, China has transformed these economies, which collectively account for nearly 9% of world GDP.	作为资源密集型增长巨兽，中国改变了这些经济体，如今它们加起来占世界GDP的近9 % 。
While all of them argue that they have diversified economic structures that are not overly dependent on Chinese commodity demand, currency markets say otherwise: whenever China’s growth expectations are revised – upward or downward – their exchange rates move in tandem.	这些国家均声称经济结构已经实现多元化，不再过度依赖中国大宗商品需求，但货币市场情况表明并非如此：只要中国增长预期调整 — — 不管向上还是向下 — — 它们的汇率也会同步波动。
The IMF currently projects that these five economies will contract by a combined 0.7% in 2016, reflecting ongoing recessions in Russia and Brazil and modest growth in the other three.	IMF最近预测，2016年这五个经济体总计将收缩0.7 % ， 其中俄罗斯和巴西继续衰退，其他增长萎靡。
Needless to say, in a China implosion scenario, this baseline estimate would be revised downward significantly.	不消说，在中国崩溃的情景中，这一基线预测将大幅向下修正。
The same would be the case for China’s Asian trading partners – most of which remain export-dependent economies, with the Chinese market their largest source of external demand.	中国的亚洲贸易伙伴也是如此 — — 它们大部分仍然是出口依赖型经济，中国市场是它们最大的外部需求源。
That is true not only of smaller Asian developing economies such as Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand, but also of the larger and more developed economies in the region, such as Japan, Korea, and Taiwan.	不仅规模较小的亚洲发展中经济体是这样，如印度尼西亚、菲律宾和泰国等；域内规模较大较发达的经济体也是这样，如日本、韩国和台湾。
Collectively, these six China-dependent Asian economies make up another 11% of world GDP.	这六个依赖中国的亚洲经济体加起来也占世界GDP的11 % 。
A China implosion could easily knock at least one percentage point off their combined growth rate.	中国崩溃至少会让它们的总增长率下降一个百分点。
The United States is also a case in point.	美国也无法独善其身。
China is America’s third-largest and most rapidly growing export market.	中国是美国的第三大也是增长最快的出口市场。
In a China-implosion scenario, that export demand would all but dry up – knocking approximately 0.2-0.3 percentage points off already subpar US economic growth of around 1.6% in 2016.	在中国崩溃情形中，这一出口需求将干涸 — — 大约会将2016年美国经济增长率拉低0.2—0.3个百分点，而美国经济原本已相当疲软，预计增长率只有1.6%左右。
Finally, there is Europe to consider.	最后来考虑欧洲。
Growth in Germany, long the engine of an otherwise sclerotic Continental economy, remains heavily dependent on exports.	长期以来，德国一直是独自支撑欧洲大陆的经济引擎，其增长仍严重依赖出口。
That is due increasingly to the importance of China – now Germany’s third-largest export market, after the European Union and the United States.	而中国的重要性越来越显著 — — 现在它是德国第三大出口市场，仅次于欧盟和美国。
In a China implosion scenario, German economic growth could also be significantly lower, dragging down the rest of a German-led Europe.	在中国崩溃情形中，德国经济增长也将显著下降，拖累��他依靠德国拉动的欧洲国家。
Interestingly, in its just-released October update of the World Economic Outlook, the IMF devotes an entire chapter to what it calls a China spillover analysis – a model-based assessment of the global impacts of a China slowdown.	有趣的是，在刚刚发布的《世界经济展望》10月份修订版中，IMF用了一整章内容进行所谓的中国溢出效应分析，即基于模型评估中国减速的全球影响。
Consistent with the arguments above, the IMF focuses on linkages to commodity exporters, Asian exporters, and what they call “systemic advanced economies” (Germany, Japan, and the US) that would be most exposed to a Chinese downturn.	与上面所罗列的观点类似，IMF重点关注中国与大宗商品出口国、亚洲出口国以及它所谓的“系统性发达经济体 ” （ 德国、日本和美国）的联系，这些国家最容易受到中国减速的波及。
By their reckoning, the impact on Asia would be the largest, followed closely by the resource economies; the sensitivity of the three developed economies is estimated to be about half that of China’s non-Japan Asian trading partners.	在IMF的分析中，亚洲受到的影响最大，其次是资源经济体；三个发达经济体的敏感性预计为中国的日本以外的亚洲贸易伙伴的一半左右。
The IMF research suggests that China’s global spillovers would add about another 25% to the direct effects of China’s growth shortfall.	IMF研究表明，中国的全球溢出效应将让中国增长缺口的直接效应放大25 % 。
That means that if Chinese economic growth vanished into thin air, in accordance with our thought experiment, the sum of the direct effects (1.2 percentage points of global growth) and indirect spillovers (roughly another 0.3 percentage points) would essentially halve the current baseline estimate of 2016 global growth, from 3.1% to 1.6%.	这意味着如果中国经济增长消失，那么根据我们的思想实验，总直接影响（全球增长下降1.2个百分点）和间接溢出效应（额外的0.3个百分点）将让当前2016年全球增长基线估计值下降一半，3.1%降至1.6 % 。
While that would be far short of the record 0.1% global contraction in 2009, it wouldn’t be much different than two earlier deep world recessions, in 1975 (1% growth) and 1982 (0.7%).	这距离2009年创纪录的全球经济收缩0.1%仍然相去甚远，但与1975年（增长1 % ） 和1982年（0.7 % ） 两次深度世界衰退已经相当接近。
I may be one of the only China optimists left.	我大概是仅有的中国乐观论者。
While I am hardly upbeat about prospects for the global economy, I think the world faces far bigger problems than a major meltdown in China.	我很少对全球经济前景感到乐观，但我认为世界所面临的问题要比中国大崩溃严重得多。
Yet I would be the first to concede that a post-crisis world economy without Chinese growth would be in grave difficulty.	然而我将第一个承认危机后的世界经济没了中国增长将陷入巨大的困难。
China bears need to be careful what they wish for.	中国悲观论者需要对自己想要的结果三思。
	
The Return of Currency Wars	货币战争回归
NEW YORK – The recent decision by the Bank of Japan to increase the scope of its quantitative easing is a signal that another round of currency wars may be under way.	纽约—日本银行最近决定提高量化宽松范围，这表明新一轮货币战争可能已经箭在弦上。
The BOJ’s effort to weaken the yen is a beggar-thy-neighbor approach that is inducing policy reactions throughout Asia and around the world.	日本银行的日元贬值政策是一种以邻为壑策略，正在导致整个亚洲和全世界的政策反应。
Central banks in China, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Thailand, fearful of losing competitiveness relative to Japan, are easing their own monetary policies – or will soon ease more.	中国、韩国、中国台湾、新加坡和泰国等地的央行担心丧失相对日本的竞争力，正在放松各自的货币政策 — — 并且很快会加码放松。
The European Central Bank and the central banks of Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, and a few Central European countries are likely to embrace quantitative easing or use other unconventional policies to prevent their currencies from appreciating.	欧洲央行和瑞士、瑞典、挪威以及一些中欧国家的央行也可能采取量化宽松或采用其他非常规政策阻止货币升值。
All of this will lead to a strengthening of the US dollar, as growth in the United States is picking up and the Federal Reserve has signaled that it will begin raising interest rates next year.	所有这些将导致美元升值，因为美国增长抬头和美联储表明将从明年开始提高利率。
But, if global growth remains weak and the dollar becomes too strong, even the Fed may decide to raise interest rates later and more slowly to avoid excessive dollar appreciation.	但是，如果全球增长保持疲软而美元表现出过度强劲，即使是美联储也可能决定延后和更加缓慢地升息以避免美元过度升值。
The cause of the latest currency turmoil is clear: In an environment of private and public deleveraging from high debts, monetary policy has become the only available tool to boost demand and growth.	新的货币战争动荡的根源很明确：在公共和私人部门从高债务状态去杠杆化的环境中，货币政策已成为唯一可行的刺激需求和增长的工具。
Fiscal austerity has exacerbated the impact of deleveraging by exerting a direct and indirect drag on growth.	财政紧缩产生直接和间接的增长拖累，放大了去杠杆化的影响。
Lower public spending reduces aggregate demand, while declining transfers and higher taxes reduce disposable income and thus private consumption.	公共支出缩减降低了总需求，而转移支付下降和税收升高降低了可支配收入，从而降低了私人消费。
In the eurozone, a sudden stop of capital flows to the periphery and the fiscal restraints imposed, with Germany’s backing, by the European Union, the International Monetary Fund, and the ECB have been a massive impediment to growth.	在欧元区，流向外围的资本流的突然中断以及欧盟、国际货币基金组织（IMF）和欧洲央行在德国的支持下所施加的财政约束已经形成了巨大的增长阻碍。
In Japan, an excessively front-loaded consumption-tax increase killed the recovery achieved this year.	在日本，过度前瞻（front-loaded）的消费税提升扼杀了去年实现的复苏。
In the US, a budget sequester and other tax and spending policies led to a sharp fiscal drag in 2012-2014.	在美国，预算自动减赤（sequester）和其他税收和支出政策导致了巨大的2012—2014年财政拖累。
And in the United Kingdom, self-imposed fiscal consolidation weakened growth until this year.	而在英国，自我施加的财政整合削弱了增长，直到今年才有所好转。
Globally, the asymmetric adjustment of creditor and debtor economies has exacerbated this recessionary and deflationary spiral.	放眼全球，债权经济体和债务经济体的不对称调整恶化了这一衰退和通缩螺旋。
Countries that were overspending, under-saving, and running current-account deficits have been forced by markets to spend less and save more.	过度支出、储蓄不足、存在经常项目赤字的国家受市场逼迫削减支出、增加储蓄。
Not surprisingly, their trade deficits have been shrinking.	毫不奇怪，它们的贸易赤字一直在减小。
But most countries that were over-saving and under-spending have not saved less and spent more; their current-account surpluses have been growing, aggravating the weakness of global demand and thus undermining growth.	但大部分过度储蓄、支出不足的国家并没有减少储蓄、增加支出；它们的经常项目盈余一直在增加，加剧了全球需求的疲软，因而拖累增长。
As fiscal austerity and asymmetric adjustment have taken their toll on economic performance, monetary policy has borne the burden of supporting faltering growth via weaker currencies and higher net exports.	财政紧缩和不对称调整已经对经济表现产生了影响，因此货币政策承担了通过货币贬值和提高净出口支持弱势增长的重任。
But the resulting currency wars are partly a zero-sum game: If one currency is weaker, another currency must be stronger; and if one country’s trade balance improves, another’s must worsen.	但由此导致的货币战争在某种程度上是一个零和博弈：如果一种货币贬值，必有另一种货币升值；如果一国贸易盈余改善，必有另一国贸易盈余恶化。
Of course, monetary easing is not purely zero-sum.	当然��货币宽松并非纯零和博弈。
Easing can boost growth by lifting asset prices (equities and housing), reducing private and public borrowing costs, and limiting the risk of a fall in actual and expected inflation.	宽松可以通过提升资产价格（股票和房地产）刺激增长、降低私人和公共借贷成本、限制实际和预期通胀下降。
Given fiscal drag and private deleveraging, lack of sufficient monetary easing in recent years would have led to double and triple dip recession (as occurred, for example, in the eurozone).	在财政拖累和私人去杠杆化的环境下，近几年来如果货币宽松不足，可能导致二次甚至三次探底（比如，欧元区就发生了这一幕 ） 。
But the overall policy mix has been sub-optimal, with too much front-loaded fiscal consolidation and too much unconventional monetary policy (which has become less effective over time).	但总体政策组合只是次优水平，前瞻财政整合和非常规货币政策（随着时间的推移，这一政策效果越来越差）过多。
A better approach in advanced economies would have comprised less fiscal consolidation in the short run and more investment in productive infrastructure, combined with a more credible commitment to medium- and long-term fiscal adjustment – and less aggressive monetary easing.	发达经济体更好的方针应该是短期减少财政整合和增加生产性基础设施投资，同时许以可信的中期和长期财政调整承诺 — — 以及更温和的货币宽松。
You can lead a horse to liquidity, but you can’t make it drink.	你可以把马拉到水边，但你不能强迫它喝水。
In a world where private aggregate demand is weak and unconventional monetary policy eventually becomes like pushing on a string, the case for slower fiscal consolidation and productive public infrastructure spending is compelling.	在私人总需求疲软、非常规货币政策最终效果消失时，减缓财政整合和生产性公共基础设施支出就成为不可缺少的要件。
Such spending offers returns that are certainly higher than the low interest rates that most advanced economies face today, and infrastructure needs are massive in both advanced and emerging economies (with the exception of China, which has overinvested in infrastructure).	在如今大部分发达经济体的低利率环境下，这类支出的回报必然会更高，而不管是发达经济体还是新兴经济体都需要大量基础设施（中国除外，它存在基础设施投资过度的问题 ） 。
Moreover, public investment works on both the demand and supply sides.	此外，公共投资对需求和供给端都能起作用。
It not only boosts aggregate demand directly; it also expands potential output by increasing the stock of productivity-boosting capital.	它不仅直接提振总需求；也通过增加能提高生产率的资本扩大了潜在产出。
Unfortunately, the political economy of austerity has led to sub-optimal outcomes.	不幸的是，紧缩的政治经济学导致了次优结果。
In a fiscal crunch, the first spending cuts hit productive public investments, because governments prefer to protect current – and often inefficient – spending on public-sector jobs and transfer payments to the private sector.	在财政动荡中，第一批支出削减就来自生产性公共投资，因为政府偏好保护当前 — — 通常效率低下 — — 的公共部门就业和向私人部门的转移支付支出。
As a result, the global recovery remains anemic in most advanced economies (with the partial exception of the US and the UK) and now also in the major emerging countries, where growth has slowed sharply in the last two years.	结果，全球复苏在大部分发达经济体毫无起色（美国和英国勉强算得上例外 ） ， 目前在新兴国家也是如此，它们的增长在过去两年中显著放缓。
The right policies – less fiscal austerity in the short run, more public investment spending, and less reliance on monetary easing – are the opposite of those that have been pursued by the world’s major economies.	正确的政策 — — 减少短期财政紧缩、增加公共投资支出、减少货币宽松依赖 — — 与世界主要经济体所追求的政策截然相反。
No wonder global growth keeps on disappointing.	毫不奇怪全球增长一直令人失望。
In a sense, we are all Japanese now.	从某种程度上讲，现在我们都是日本人。
	
A Roadmap to End Cholera	消灭霍乱路线图
GENEVA – “Where is your toilet?”	日内瓦 — “ 请问洗手间在哪 ？ ”
This is often the first question I ask when I visit the site of a cholera outbreak anywhere in the world.	每当我访问霍乱爆发地区，这常常是我问的第一个问题。
More often than not, the answer is: “We don’t have one.	更多时候，我获得的回答是“我们没有洗手间。
We go wherever we can.”	哪里方便就在哪里解决 。 ”
Cholera, an ancient disease, has become a disease of poverty.	霍乱这个古老的病种，如今已经成为贫穷病。
It does not discriminate geographically, but it preys mostly on vulnerable communities in areas with poor sanitation.	它本身不具有地理区别，但主要在卫生设施落后的脆弱社区传播。
Carried by contaminated floodwaters to sources of drinking water, transported by unsuspecting travelers, or brought into homes on produce irrigated with untreated sewage, the Vibrio cholerae bacterium settles in the small intestine after it is ingested, causing severe diarrhea and dehydration.	携带霍乱弧菌的洪水进入到饮用水水源，然后被毫无戒心的旅行者传播，或进入用未处理过的污水进行灌溉的家庭，被摄入人体后栖息于小肠，引发严重腹泻和脱水。
Those who are fortunate enough never to have witnessed cholera’s effects firsthand might assume that it is just another stomach bug.	那些从未亲眼目睹霍乱影响的幸运儿，可能会认为这无非是有一种肠胃病。
But without swift medical attention, cholera can sap the life out of an adult or child in a matter of hours.	但如果不迅速进行治疗，霍乱可能会在几个小时内夺走成年人或儿童的生命。
Each year, cholera claims the lives of an estimated 95,000 people; many who die are children.	每年，霍乱都会导致大约95,000人死亡；其中许多是儿童。
This year, images of listless, glassy-eyed cholera victims awaiting treatment have emerged in countries worldwide.	今年，无精打采、双目无神的待治疗霍乱患者的形象出现在世界各国。
The disease has spread at an unprecedented rate in Yemen, where more than 2,000 people have died since April.	这种疾病以前所未有的速度在也门传播，4月份以来已造成2,000多人死亡。
Cholera outbreaks are ongoing in Somalia, South Sudan, Haiti, and other countries across sub-Saharan Africa and Asia.	索马里、南苏丹、海地和其他许多撒哈拉以南非洲和亚洲国家也发生了霍乱疫情爆发。
But the saddest fact about cholera’s recent toll on human lives is that every single death was preventable.	但关于最近的致命霍乱疫情的最令人悲哀的事实是每个人的死亡其实都是可以避免的。
The world already has the knowledge and tools to control cholera effectively, but existing resources are not being aligned with the necessary global commitments.	世界早已掌握了有效控制霍乱的知识和工具，但现有资源与必要的全球承诺不相匹配。
That is why the new global strategy developed by the Global Task Force on Cholera Control, a diverse network of technical partners, is so vital.	因此，多元化的技术合作网络 — — 全球霍乱控制任务小组（Global Task Force on Cholera Control）至关重要。
Ending Cholera – A Global Roadmap to 2030 emphasizes a shift to proactive approaches, and aims to reduce cholera deaths by 90% over the next decade.	《消灭霍乱 — — 2030年全球路线图 》 （ Ending Cholera – A Global Roadmap to 2030）强调要转向积极预防方针，制定了在未来十年让霍乱致死人数减少90%的目标。
With full implementation, the plan could also help as many as 20 countries eliminate disease transmission in the same timeframe.	如果能得到全面实施，该计划将帮助多达20个国家在相同的时间框架内根除霍乱传播。
Based on three pillars – early detection, integrated prevention tactics, and coordination between countries and partners – the roadmap provides a concrete path for ending cholera as a public health threat.	该路线图基于三个支柱 — — 早期监测、集中预防以及国家和合作伙伴间的合作 — — 为消灭作为公共卫生威胁的霍乱提供了非常具体的路径。
Once cholera grips a community, it becomes increasingly difficult to control.	一旦霍乱在一个社区内爆发，就会日益难以控制。
It is important, therefore, that the disease is not forgotten even when it is not claiming victims.	因此，很重要的一点是，即使没有报告病例，也不能将它遗忘。
A multi-sector approach that includes investments in water, sanitation, and hygiene – so-called WASH services – can keep cholera at bay.	包括了水、下水道设施和卫生（所谓的WASH服务）投资在内的多部门方针能够将霍乱控制在未萌发状态。
So can the proactive use of oral cholera vaccines and quick access to treatments, such as oral rehydration solution and intravenous fluids.	用口服霍乱疫苗进行预防和快速治疗手段（如口服补水剂和静脉注射）也能起到同样的作用。
Improving WASH infrastructure is the most effective path to prevention, though implementing these services will take time in countries with fewer resources.	改善WASH基础设施是最有效的预防方法，尽管在资源匮乏国家落实这些服务需要时间。
For this reason, the roadmap also encourages the preemptive and large-scale deployment of oral vaccines in cholera hotspots.	因此，路线图还鼓励在霍乱高发地区预防性地大量配置口服疫苗。
The vaccines work immediately, and can prevent cholera for up to three years, serving as a bridge to the implementation of longer-term solutions.	疫苗能够立刻起作用，在三年内防止霍乱爆发，为实施长期解决方案争取时间。
Oral cholera vaccines are available via a global stockpile maintained by the World Health Organization, with support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.	口服霍乱疫苗可以通过世界卫生组织在Gavi即疫苗联盟的支持下维持的全球储备获得。
More than 15 million doses have been distributed to 18 countries since the program’s creation in 2013.	自2013年该计划成立以来，已有超过1,500剂疫苗分配给18个国家。
Next year, the stockpile is set to increase to more than 25 million doses, up from two million when it began.	明年，疫苗储备将增加到2,500万剂以上，而成立之初只有两百万剂。
Ending cholera as a health threat by 2030, as global partners and the WHO recently pledged, will require sustained collaboration and commitment from cholera-affected countries, technical partners, and international donors.	要在2030年前消灭作为卫生威胁的霍乱 — — 这是全球合作伙伴和世卫组织最新做出的承诺 — — 需要来自受霍乱影响的国家、技术合作伙伴和国际捐赠者的持续合作和致力。
The goal may seem daunting, given that millions of people around the world are at risk of contracting the disease each year.	考虑到如今全世界每年仍有数百万人有可能沾染霍乱，这一目标似乎非常艰巨。
But with urbanization, climate change, and other factors likely to increase the threat of infection, it is a goal that must be met.	但在城市化、气候变化和其他因素有可能让传染风险进一步加剧的情况下，我们必须实现这一目标。
The roadmap makes this possible.	路线图让它成为可能。
Implementing the plan will prove to be a cost-effective solution for countries saddled with responding to frequent cholera outbreaks.	实施路线图计划将是饱受霍乱反复爆发的国家性价比最高的解决方案。
That is one reason why action is urgently needed.	这也是急需行动起来的原因之一。
But embracing the strategy is also the right thing to do for the international community.	但对国际社会来说，采纳这一战略也是一件正确的事。
Governments have a moral obligation to ensure that no one succumbs to a preventable death.	政府有确保所有人都不会遭遇可预防死亡的道德义务。
It is an obligation the WHO shares, and it is why we will work hard to help the world meet the ambitious targets we have set.	这也是世界卫生组织的义务，因此，我们将努力帮助世界实现我们所制定的雄心勃勃的目标。
We have the tools needed to beat cholera.	我们拥有战胜霍乱所需要的工具。
Now, with a plan in place, there can no longer be any excuse not to put them to use.	现在，我们又有了计划，没有任何借口不把计划和工具落到实处。
	
A Tipping Point Missed	错失的临界点
WASHINGTON, DC – Before America and the world settle in firmly to the new Donald Trump-based reality, let’s take a little trip down the road not taken.	华盛顿—在美国和世界踏实既受新的基于特朗普的现实之前，让我们来窥探一番美国人民没有选择的那条路。
Suppose we had woken up last Wednesday morning to a President-elect Hillary Clinton.	假设我们上周三醒来，发现克林顿当选了美国总统。
And let’s say that, instead of former Portuguese Prime Minister António Guterres, New Zealand’s Helen Clark or Bulgaria’s Kristalina Georgieva had been picked to succeed Ban Ki-moon as United Nations Secretary-General.	并且，不是葡萄牙前总理古特雷斯，而是新西兰的海伦·克拉克（Helen Clark）或保加利亚的克里斯塔利娜·乔治艾娃（Kristalina Georgieva）被遴选为联合国秘书长潘基文的继任者。
Clinton would have joined the United Kingdom’s Theresa May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, helping achieve critical mass in the G7.	克林顿将和英国的梅和德国的默克尔一起，在G7形成临界规模。
And a female UN Secretary-General would have placed women at the helm of two of the world’s three biggest international organizations (France’s Christine Lagarde already runs the International Monetary Fund).	而女联合国秘书长将让女性拥有世界三大国际组织中两个的最高职位。
With so many female leaders, we would have begun to answer the question: what happens when women run the world?	在拥有如此多女性领导人的情况下，我们将开始问一个问题：当女性统治世界时，会发生什么？
Would the world be better for women?	世界会变得对女性更加友好吗？
Would it even be different?	它会有所不同吗？
According to sociologists, female leaders are of two schools: Queen Bees, who are less likely to help other women advance, and Righteous Women, who make the advancement of other women a priority.	按照社会学家的分类，女性领导人可以归为两类：蜂后型，不太可能帮助其他女性晋升；以及正义女神型，将把其他女性的晋升列为重点。
Most early pioneers, such as the UK’s Margaret Thatcher, India’s Indira Gandhi, and Israel’s Golda Meir, were Queen Bees; all of them eschewed feminism.	大部分早期先驱，如英国的撒切尔夫人、印度的英迪拉·甘地和以色列的梅厄夫人，都属于蜂后型；她们都回避女权主义。
More recently, Righteous Women have prevailed.	最近，正义女神型开始得势。
Leaders like Argentina’s Cristina Kirchner, Brazil’s Dilma Rousseff, and Iceland’s Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir have all sought, in one way or another, to empower women and help them advance in their countries.	阿根廷的克里斯蒂娜·基什内尔、巴西的罗塞夫、冰岛的西于尔扎多蒂（Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir）以各种各样的方式为女性赋权并帮助她们在各自国家提高地位。
Merkel and May have tended to be more like Queen Bees, while Clinton, Lagarde, Clark, and Georgieva are more like Righteous Women.	默克尔和梅以往更倾向于是蜂后型，而克林顿、拉加德、克拉克和乔治艾娃更像是正义女神型。
To be fair, the first woman leader in a male-dominated culture must often outman the men.	公平地说，在男性主导的世界中的第一位女性领导人往往必须比男人还男人。
Seeking to advance other women can highlight her own womanhood and thereby weaken her.	寻求提升其他女性地位可能突出她自身的女人性质，从而削弱她。
Clinton, for example, was the third woman US Secretary of State but the first who felt secure enough to be able to champion the cause of women and girls worldwide.	比如，克林顿是第三位美国女国务卿，但她是第一位感觉自己地位足够安全，能够引领全球妇女和女孩运动的女国务卿。
As President, she pledged, half her cabinet would be women, and she would further the State Department initiatives launched during her tenure.	作为总统，她承诺内阁中将有一半是女性，并将进一步推进她在国务院任内退出的措施。
Yes, she also would have been careful to avoid being defined as a woman president.	是的，她也将小心翼翼避免被定义为女总统。
Still, just the presence of a plurality of women has an impact.	但是，仅仅是出现了大量女性面���就能产生影响。
For example, studies of US courts with multiple judges show that male judges are more willing to hear bias cases when one woman is on the bench, and significantly more willing when a second woman is added.	比如，对有多名法官的美国法庭的研究表明，男法官更愿意在有女法官在场的情况下听取偏见案例，而如果有第二位女法官加入，他的意愿会大大增加。
“Each of us,” noted Sandra Day O’Connor, the first female member of the US Supreme Court, who was renowned for not wanting to be perceived as a “female” justice, “brings to our job, whatever it is, our lifetime of experience and our values.”	“我们每个人 ， ” 因为不愿意被认为是“女性”正义的化身而闻名的美国最高法院第一位女法官桑德拉·奥康纳（Sandra Day O’Connor）指出 ， “ 都会在职业生涯中带上我们的生活经验和我们的价值观，不管这些东西是什么 。 ”
In other words, women bring a fresh perspective, heard clearly only when a critical mass of them is present in any institution.	换句话说，女性带来了新鲜视角，只有当她们在某一机构中达到临界规模时才能被听到。
Consider a woman’s perspective on conflict.	考虑一个女性对冲突的视角。
Evidence does not support the stereotype that women are more pacifist than men – the peacemakers and settlers of male disputes.	证据并不支持女性比男性更爱和平的刻板印象 — — 男性纠纷的和平缔造者和“和事佬 ” 。
Women can be Amazons; recall Thatcher’s prosecution of the Falklands War and her admonition to George H.W. Bush not to “go wobbly” in the run-up to the first Gulf War.	女性可以是亚马逊战士；想想撒切尔夫人发动的马岛战争和她在第一次海湾战争前夕对老布什不要“摇摆”的劝诫。
On the other hand, when men see wars, they naturally imagine the world of the warriors, whereas women see themselves in the women who must try to shelter their families from forces they cannot control.	另一方面，男性在看待战争时会自然想象出一个战士的世界，而女性常常把自己看成必须保护家庭不受她们无法控制的力量摧残的女人。
That is precisely the diversity of perspective that is vital to decision-making.	正是这种视角上的多元化对于决策来说至关重要。
And indeed, the Institute for Inclusive Security at Harvard’s Kennedy School has tracked the differences women make as part of peace negotiations.	事实上，哈佛大学肯尼迪学院的包容性安全研究所（Institute for Inclusive Security）跟踪观察了女性参与和平谈判时所造成的不同。
An acute awareness of the magnitude of civilian suffering in conflicts such as the Syrian civil war or the ongoing horrors in the Congo Basin, and an appreciation of how cycles of violence perpetuate themselves over generations, can actually make women much more likely to urge the use of force in interventions.	敏锐地认识到平民在叙利亚内战和刚果盆地的持续恐怖事件等冲突中可能受到的苦难，以及理解冤冤相报如何在代际间传递确实可能让女性更加可能采取武力干预。
Former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright famously chided Colin Powell for his reluctance to involve the US military in the Balkans in the 1990s, in part because of her own family’s experience as Czech refugees from Communism.	前美国国务卿奥尔布赖特（Madeleine Albright）对科林·鲍威尔（Colin Powell）提出过著名的批评，指责他在20世纪90年代不肯让美军介入巴尔干冲突，这部分是因为她身为捷克共产主义难民的亲身家庭经验。
Overall, a woman leader’s decisions are no more predictable than a male leader’s.	总体而言，女性领导人的决定比男性领导人更加容易预测。
Women are not monolithic: they have various ideological backgrounds and diverse governing styles.	女性不顽固：她们有不同的思想背景和多元化的执政风格。
But when the world finally reaches the point when women are not a rarity at the tables of power, when their numbers reach a tipping point, their voices will be heard differently, and their opinions will hold more weight with the men around them.	但当女性终于不再是权力桌上的稀客时，当女性数量达到临界点时，她们的声音将有所不同，她们的观点将对周边男性具备更大分量的影响。
Women came closer in 2016 than in any other era to reaching that tipping point.	2016年，女性比以往任何时候都更加接近于这一临界点。
But we may still have to wait decades to find out what will happen when we finally do.	但我们也许仍然需要等待几十年才能了解当临界点终于达到时会发生什么。
	
Homesick Politics	乡愁政治
MADRID – World order – or the lack thereof – is a hot topic these days.	马德里 — — 世界秩序 — — 或者说世界秩序的缺失 — — 是现如今的热门话题。
Our fixation with the future of global structures and systems is evident everywhere – in the news and at conferences, on bestseller lists, even in popular television shows.	我们对全球结构和体系未来的执着随处可见 — — 这种执着不仅存在于新闻会议、畅销书排行榜，甚至存在于热播的电视节目里。
People are anxious.	人们倍感焦虑。
The world seems to be undergoing fundamental change: new actors are emerging on the world stage, previously sacrosanct rules of international behavior are being openly defied, and a new wave of technological progress is disrupting entire industries and economic sectors.	世界似乎正在发生根本的变化：新力量登上世界舞台，此前国际行为神圣不可侵犯的规则正在公然遭到蔑视，与此同时新一轮技术进步浪潮正在扰乱整个行业经济。
In our quest for structure and predictability – a natural impulse in times of rapid change – we are desperate for hints about how the world, and our role in it, will develop.	我们在这个快速变化的时代本能地追求结构和可预测性，不顾一切地想要了解世界和我们自身将向何处去。
It is of course vital in such situations that we identify the best, or at least the most feasible, way forward; predictability provides a foundation for cost-benefit analysis and strategic thinking.	当然，重要的是在这种情况下找到最佳、或至少是最可行的前进线路；可预见性奠定了成本效益分析和战略思维的基础。
The problem arises when our yearning for certainty overwhelms rational thinking, taking our ideas and actions in an unproductive – or even dangerous – direction.	问题就出在我们对确定性的向往压倒了理性思维，从而将我们的思想和行动带往低效 — — 甚至是危险的方向。
The current trend toward rose-colored retrospection is a case in point.	现在流行带着玫瑰色的回忆就是一个很好的例子。
Faced with political, economic, geostrategic, and social uncertainty, policymakers have increasingly succumbed to the allure of nostalgia, promising a return to what they portray as the familiar and complete rules and practices of the past.	面对政治、经济、地缘政治和社会动荡，决策者们越来越屈服于怀旧的魅力，信誓旦旦要恢复他们所谓熟悉而完整的过去的规则和惯例。
In Russia, President Vladimir Putin has been operating according to a nineteenth-century worldview, in which great powers dominate their spheres of influence unchallenged.	在俄罗斯，普京总统一直奉行某种19世纪的世界观，认定大国毋庸置疑地主宰自己的势力领域。
As he noted at last October’s meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club, “The bear will not even bother to ask permission.	去年十月他曾在瓦尔代辩论俱乐部会议上指出 ， “ 熊才懒得去管别人同意不同意。
Here, we consider it the master of the taiga.”	在我们俄罗斯，熊是主宰针叶林的王者 。 ”
The Islamic State is attempting to return to an even more distant past.	伊斯兰国正试图回到更遥远的过去。
Its adherents espouse a medieval ninth-century doctrine to justify their effort to reestablish the caliphate, in which “the legality of all emirates, groups, states, and organizations becomes null” and summary execution and slavery are mandatory.	其追随者信奉中世纪9世纪学说来证明自己竭尽全力重建哈里发，目的是让“酋长、团体、国家和组织的合法性全部失效 ” ， 并执行即刻处决和强制奴役。
The West, too, has fallen into the trap of nostalgia, clinging to a late-twentieth-century conception of order in which it makes the rules and can choose whether to follow them.	西方也同样落入到怀旧的陷阱。 他们死抱住二十世纪末的秩序理念不放，固执地认定应由自己来制定规则并选择遵守与否。
The latest example of this anachronistic perspective is America’s ham-fisted (not to mention failed) attempt to stem support for the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, after repeatedly refusing to provide a greater voice for the world’s emerging powers in the Bretton Woods institutions.	这种过时观点的最新例子是美国笨手笨脚（更不用说失败）地试图阻止国际社会支持由中国领导的亚洲基础设施投资银行，之前美国曾一再拒绝在布雷顿森林体系中给这个新兴全球大国更大的发言权力。
Nostalgia has also emerged as a major factor in many countries’ domestic affairs.	怀旧也成为左右许多国家国内事务的主旋律。
Throughout Europe, populist parties – from the right-wing United Kingdom Independence Party to the far-left Syriza in Greece – seek a return to the ostensibly simpler and happier times of national control and closed borders.	在欧洲各国，民粹主义党派 — — 从右翼英国独立党到激进的希腊左翼联盟 — — 都在追求回归表面单纯快乐的国家管制和边界封闭。
In the US, a prominent strain of jurisprudence defends the “original intent” of the Constitution’s framers, while Republicans are shifting toward isolationism and Democrats are denouncing free-trade agreements.	在美国，一系列著名的法律体系捍卫着宪法制定者们所谓的“原意 ” ， 而共和党越来越向孤立主义靠拢、民主党则不断谴责自由贸易协议。
But nostalgia offers no solutions – only a dream of escape.	但怀旧解决不了任何问题 — — 仅仅是场逃避的美梦而已。
Looking backward gets us no closer to what we want; on the contrary, it is a surefire way to miss the challenges – and miss out on the opportunities – that lie before us.	回忆给不了我们想要的东西；相反，它却能让我们错过近在眼前的挑战和机遇。
Trying to advance one’s interests based on the rules of the past is like trying to solve today’s crossword puzzle using yesterday’s clues.	想要依据过去规则追求自身利益就像用昨天的线索来解今天的填字游戏。
Let’s face it: the halcyon world to which many people are so eager to return – before, say, the European Union or the United Nations or even the nation-state – never really existed.	我们必须面对现实：人们如此渴望回归的宁静世界 — — 欧盟、联合国甚至是民族国家建立前的世界 — — 从来就没有存在过。
As Marcel Proust noted: “Remembrance of things past is not necessarily the remembrance of things as they were.”	就像普鲁斯特所说的那样 ： “ 对过去的回忆不一定反映过去本来的样子 。 ”
The past is being abridged and sugarcoated in order to portray it as superior to the widespread tumult and misery of today.	我们对过去进行了删减和美化，才让它在今天的混乱和痛苦面前更具吸引力。
Over time, nostalgia has come to have a benign connotation.	随着时间的推移，怀旧的内涵变得越来越亲切。
But the word – a combination of the Greek nostos (homecoming) and algos (pain) – was coined to describe the disease of “acute homesickness.”	但怀旧一词 — — 希腊语nostos（回家）和algos （痛苦）的组合被放在一起形容“极度想家”的顽疾。
Perhaps it would be beneficial to return to that definition of nostalgia, at least in its political manifestation, as something more akin to an illness: a condition that distorts reality and impedes the formulation of effective solutions for real-world challenges.	至少在政治表现方面，或许应该回到怀旧最初“更接近于某种疾病”的定义：这种病扭曲现实并妨碍有效解决现实的难题。
No worldview rooted in the nineteenth century – much less in the ninth century – is adequate to the complexities of today’s globalized world.	没有哪种植根于19世纪 — — 更不用说9世纪 — — 的世界观能够应对今天全球化世界的复杂局势。
Likewise, the rise of new powers and non-state actors means that rule making (and breaking) can no longer be restricted to a small Western club.	同样，全新大国及非国家力量的崛起意味着规则的制定（和打破）不能再作为西方小型俱乐部的专利。
And the intensity of global competition means that European countries cannot hope to thrive independently of one another.	全球竞争的激烈程度意味着欧洲国家不能再关起门来追求富裕。
Flimsy ideas thrive in the absence of a viable alternative.	没有其他可行方案才造成不可行的想法遍地都是。
That is why a period of reflection on world order is so important.	因此有必要对世界秩序进行反思。
But, rather than allowing ourselves to be swept up in the regressive tide of nostalgia, we need to engage one another in a constructive conversation about the challenges that we actually face and propose new ideas for addressing them.	但与其陷在怀旧的倒退潮流里，还不如就世界所面临的挑战进行积极对话并提出新的解决思路。
	
Managing a World of Great Powers	管理列强的世界
MADRID – Today, great-power competition is a fact: The United States now competes with an increasingly active Russia and a rising China.	马德里—如今，列强相争已是一个事实：美国与日益活跃的俄罗斯和崛起的中国竞争。
The Middle East, the South China Sea, and Ukraine are just three theaters where this new reality is playing out.	中东、南海和乌克兰只是这一新现实的三个展现舞台。
Upon rereading former US Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott’s book The Great Experiment, I was left with the impression that the seeds of some of the dynamics at play today were sown some time ago.	在阅读美国前副国务卿塔尔博特（Strobe Talbott）的著作《大实验 》 （ The Great Experiment）时，我的印象是今天正在起作用的动态的某些根源很早前就种下了。
The book describes a conversation that took place in December 2000 between President Bill Clinton and President-elect George W. Bush.	该书描述了2000年12月美国总统克林顿和当选总统小布什之间的一段对哈。
Clinton says that, judging by Bush’s electoral campaign, the security issues that seemed to concern him most were Saddam Hussein and the construction of a large-scale antimissile defense system.	克林顿说，从小布什的选战看来，他最担心的安全问题是萨达姆和大规模反导防务系统的建设。
“That’s absolutely right,” Bush responds.	“完全正确 。 ” 小布什回答说。
These issues were put on hold when tragedy unexpectedly struck, in the form of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the US, which brought a period of international cooperation during which solidarity against terrorism reigned.	当意料之外的悲剧发生时 — — 2001年9月11日美国发生恐怖袭击，这带来了一段国际合作时期，世界因为反恐团结在一起 — — 这些问题被搁置起来。
It was a time when we were all Americans, and when Bush described Putin as “very straightforward and trustworthy.”	那时，我们都是美国人，而小布什把普京描述为“非常直接，非常值得信任 。 ”
The winds began to change that December, when the US announced that it was withdrawing from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, in order to build an antimissile defense system to protect itself from a potentially nuclearized Iran.	那年12月，风向开始转变，美国宣布它将退出反弹道导弹条约，目的是为了建设反导弹防御系统保护自己免受潜在核力量伊朗的威胁。
This did not go unnoticed in Russia.	这一举动没有逃过俄罗斯的眼睛。
The US at the time did not seem to understand that a multipolar world order was emerging – one that would make it very difficult to pursue, without serious consequences, the policies that Bush and Clinton had discussed in 2000.	当时的美国似乎并不理解多极的世界正在形成 — — 在这样一个世界里，你很难在不引起严重后果的情况下追求2000年小布什和克林顿所讨论的政策。
In a 2007 speech at the Munich Security Conference, Russian President Vladimir Putin made this plain, vehemently rejecting the intervention in Iraq and especially US plans to expand antimissile defense systems to Europe, calling this an act of aggression toward Russia and a breach of common European security.	2007年，在俄罗斯总统普京在慕尼黑安全会议的演讲中断然拒绝干预伊朗，尤其是美国将其反导弹防御系统扩大到欧洲的计划，称这是对俄罗斯的侵略行为，也违反了共同欧洲安全。
In the summer of 2008, three events placed the new multipolar order in stark relief.	2008年夏，三件事让这一新多极秩序显露无疑。
China dazzled the world as host of the Olympic Games, reinforcing its status as a significant international player.	中国举办了一届令人炫目的奥运会，强化了其作为重要国际行动方的地位。
Russia’s military actions in Georgia – in the midst of the Games – showed the world that the concept of spheres of influence was still alive and well in the Kremlin.	俄罗斯出兵格鲁吉亚 — — 时间选在了奥运会期间 — — 告诉世界势力范围的概念仍然活生生地存在于克里姆林宫。
And the collapse the following month of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, which unleashed a global financial crisis from which the world economy has yet to recover fully, underscored the advanced economies’ vulnerabilities, while largely sparing China.	9月美国投资银行雷曼兄弟公司倒闭引发了一场全球金融危机，世界经济至今仍未从中复苏，这凸显出发达经济体的弱点，但中国基本上独善其身。
With a new sense of confidence in its great-power status, China seemed to qualify the concept of a “peaceful rise” that its leaders have invoked since the era of Deng Xiaoping, adopting a more muscular foreign-policy approach within its neighborhood.	带着对其列强地位的新的信心，中国表面上符合自邓小平时代开始实施的“和平崛起”的概念，但对周边近邻采取了更加强硬的外交方针。
Drawing on alleged historical rights, China began to expand its territorial claims, along with its military presence, in the South and East China Seas.	中国基于所谓的历史权利扩大其在南海和东海的领土主张并派兵遣将。
In 2013, tensions peaked when China unilaterally declared an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) covering territories in the East China Sea that it claims, but Japan controls.	2013年，中国单方面宣布了覆盖其所主张但由日本控制的东海领土的防空识别区。
Many of the countries affected by China’s actions in the South and East China Seas have security treaties with the US, which has been the major maritime power in the Pacific region since World War II.	在南海和东海受到中国行为影响的国家大多与美国签订了安全条约。 自二战以来，美国一直是太平洋地区最主要的海上力量。
China’s ADIZ declaration was therefore viewed by the US as a provocation.	因此，在美国看来，中国宣布防空识别区是一种挑衅。
By expanding its sovereignty claims, China was actually expanding its claims to influence.	中国扩大其主权主张，实质是在扩大其影响力主张。
It has taken the international institutions some time to catch up to the changing world order.	国际机构需要一定时间才能跟上变化的国际秩序。
The 2010 G-20 summit in Seoul produced an agreement to increase the emerging countries’ quotas in the International Monetary Fund by 2014.	2010年首尔G-10峰会形成了在2014年增加新兴国家IMF投票权的协议。
But the US Congress refused to ratify the changes, so nothing came of the agreement.	但美国国会拒绝批准这一变化，因此这一协议等于是一纸空文。
China then took matters into its own hands, spearheading the creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.	于是中国干脆另起炉灶，牵头成立了亚洲基础设施投资银行。
Fragmentation of the international institutions seemed imminent – that is, until European countries decided to join the AIIB.	国际机构的分裂似乎一触即发 — — 直到欧洲国家决定加入亚投行。
Though the US resisted at first, and has still refused to join, that decision was lent some nuance in a later conversation between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Barack Obama.	尽管美国一开始从中阻挠，并且至今仍拒绝加入，但这一决定在后来中国国家主席习近平和美国总统奥巴马的会谈中有了一些微妙的变化。
Meanwhile, Russia was exposing its own renewed foreign-policy ambitions in Ukraine.	与此同时，俄罗斯正在乌克兰暴露其新的外交政策野心。
By violating the Helsinki Final Act in the spring of 2014, Putin placed Russian foreign policy in direct opposition to that of the US and Europe.	2014年，普京违反赫尔辛基最终议定书，俄罗斯外交政策开始与美国��欧洲直接冲突。
This position was reaffirmed in September, when Putin decided to intervene in the Syrian conflict, securing for Russia a role in any attempt to bring peace to the country.	这一立场在9月得到确认，普京决定干预叙利亚冲突，确保叙利亚和平方案中必须有俄罗斯的存在。
Today, the world is very different from what some might have imagined at the end of the last century, a decade after the Berlin Wall came down.	当今世界与上个世纪末、柏林墙倒塌十周年时人们所想象的世界大不相同。
Historically speaking, 15 years can seem long or short, depending on the intensity of change.	从历史上看，15年既可以很长，也可以很短，取决于变化的剧烈程度。
During the last 15 years of mounting great-power competition and renewed instability in the Middle East – including the Arab Spring, the rise of the brutal Islamic State, Sunni-Shia proxy wars, and unspeakable human suffering – change has been very intense, to say the least.	过去十五年，列强竞争愈演愈烈，中东动荡卷土重来 — — 包括阿拉伯之春、残暴的伊斯兰国的崛起、逊尼派-什叶派代理战争以及不可名状的人道灾难 — — 变化不可不谓剧烈。
But confrontation is not the whole story.	但冲突并非故事的全部。
Promising steps have been made in two critical areas: nuclear non-proliferation, especially through the nuclear deal with Iran, and the fight against climate change, exemplified in the encouraging preparations for the current climate summit in Paris.	在两大关键领域有了令人振奋的进展：核不扩散（特别是通过伊核协议）以及遏制气候变化（眼下的巴黎气候峰会所呈现出的鼓舞人心的准备工作就是明证 ） 。
If there is one lesson to be learned from all of this, it is that well-executed, tenacious diplomacy still holds extraordinary power to resolve conflicts.	如果说我们可以从所有这些发展趋势中学到什么的话，那就是坚韧不拔地做好外交工作依然能够在解决冲突方面起到极大的作用。
It remains the best instrument to produce those cooperative outcomes that confrontation effectively impedes.	外交仍是形成这些大受冲突掣肘的合作成果的最佳工具。
	
How Press Freedom Is Won	如何赢得言论自由
ACCRA – Every year on May 3 – World Press Freedom Day – news producers and consumers pause to reflect on the state of global media.	阿克拉—每年5月3日是世界新闻自由日，这一天，新闻制造者和消费者会停下脚步，深思全球媒体的状态。
This year, as journalists and government officials gather in Ghana for the event’s 25th observance, attention will turn to the myriad pressures and challenges confronting the profession worldwide, and how official and state-sponsored hostility toward the press is threatening democracy.	今年，记者和政府官员齐聚加纳出席第25个世界新闻自由日活动，关注点将转向世界各地新闻界所面临的各种挑战，以及有官员和国家撑腰的针对新闻媒体的敌意如何威胁民主。
But these concerns, though certainly valid, are not the entire story.	但这些关注点固然是必要的，却并非故事的全部。
Signs of journalistic resilience are also emerging.	新闻韧性（journalistic resilience）的信号也在不断浮现。
So, rather than focusing exclusively on the obstacles journalists around the world are facing, let’s mark May 3 by considering the many reasons for optimism.	因此，我们不必只关注世界各地记者所面临的各种障碍，5月3日有很多理由值得保持乐观。
For starters, while no media market is immune to erosion of press freedom, resistance is possible.	首先，尽管媒体市场无法免于侵蚀新闻自由，但仍有往保持韧性。
Recent events in Europe are illustrative.	最近在欧洲发生的一系列事件很有说明性。
In Slovakia, public outrage over the politically motivated double murder of an investigative journalist, Ján Kuciak, and his fiancée, Martina Kušnírová, forced Prime Minister Robert Fico to resign, and has his successor, Peter Pellegrini, walking a public-relations tightrope.	在斯洛伐克，出于政治动机对调查记者延·库西亚克（Ján Kuciak）和他的未婚妻马丁娜·库什尼罗娃（Martina Kušnírová）的谋杀引起了众怒，迫使总理罗伯特·费科辞职，他的继任者彼得·佩莱格里尼也对公共关系如履薄冰。
Hungary, too, has experienced its own, albeit tamer, version of journalistic pushback.	匈牙利也经历了新闻压制事件，但没有那么激烈。
According to a recent study by the European Journalism Center, despite deepening government control over how the media operates, investigative reporting remains active, and “abuses of the taxpayers’ money are regularly exposed.”	据欧洲新闻中心（European Journalism Center）的最新研究，尽管政府对媒体经营加强了控制，但调查报道依然活跃 ， “ 滥用纳税人的钱的亲狂时有曝光 ” 。
To be sure, the media are under attack like never before, and not only from fake news and polarizing presidents.	平心而论，媒体所遭到的打击从未如此强烈，且打击不仅仅来自假新闻和走极端的国家首脑。
The slaying of nine journalists in Kabul on April 30, in back-to-back suicide bombings that killed at least 25 people, marked the deadliest day for journalists in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban, and added to a grim global tally.	4月30日，喀布尔9名记者被杀害，这一系列背靠背自杀式爆炸至少造成25人死亡，是塔利班倒台以来阿富汗新闻界最血腥的一天，也是全世界的黑暗之日。
According to Reporters Without Borders, more than 1,000 journalists have been murdered around the world in the last 15 years, and only a handful of the perpetrators have been brought to justice.	据无国界记者组织（Reporters Without Borders）的数据，过去15年中全世界有1,000多名记者被杀害，而只有极少数行凶者被缉拿归案。
And yet fresh glimmers of hope are multiplying.	但希望的星星之火正在闪现。
Around the world, journalists and their supporters are fighting back in encouraging ways.	放眼全球，记者和他们的支持者正在以令人鼓舞的方式进行反击。
Consider online censorship.	以在线审查为例。
While governments from China to Russia routinely block or filter access to the Internet, half of the world’s population is now connected – a 20% increase in only five years.	尽管中国和俄罗斯等国政府一直在阻止或过滤互联网接入，但全世界有一半人口已经实现互联 — — 在短短五年中增加了20 % 。
In Sudan, journalists are using this connectivity to save lives.	在苏丹，记者利用互联拯救生命。
Last year, when the government refused to inform the public about a devastating cholera outbreak, journalists with Radio Dabanga, working with doctors and nurses, used the WhatsApp messaging service to share information about prevention and treatment.	去年，政府拒绝通知民众灾难性的霍乱疫情，达班加广播（Radio Dabanga）的记者与医生和护士一起使用WhatsApp短信服务分享关于预防和治疗的信息。
Even in a violent and divided country like Somalia, the Internet is being used for good; increased streaming speeds have kept members of the country’s sizable diaspora connected with friends and family, and have enabled meaningful dialogue across communities.	即使是索马里等饱受暴力和分裂之苦的国家，互联网也得到了很好的运用：日益提高的网速让数量庞大的索马里侨民得以和亲朋好友保持联系，也让群体之间得以展开有意义的对话。
Legal norms are also moving in the right direction.	法律规范也在朝着正确的方向发展。
Between 2011 and 2016, the number of countries with freedom of information laws increased from 90 to 112.	2011—2016年间，实施信息自由法的国家从90个增加到112个。
This commitment was deepened last month when the European Union adopted a new law to protect whistle-blowers from prosecution.	上个月，欧盟实施了一项新法律保护告密者免遭起诉，信息自由得到了进一步深化。
In a statement, authorities said they hoped the measure would be a boon to investigative journalists by protecting sources who report violations of European law.	当局在一份声明中说，他们希望这项措施可以通过保护报告违反欧洲法律的线人，来提振调查记者。
Where fewer legal protections are in place, journalists are becoming more creative.	在法律保护较弱的地方，记者的创造力也会变得更强。
In the Philippines, where independent news organizations have become targets of slander by politicians and online trolls, reporters are turning the tables with devastating effect.	在菲律宾，独立新闻组织成为政客和网络“黑子”造谣中伤的目标，但记者成功地扭转了局面，大获全胜。
For example, in a recent series of reports identifying people making threats against the media, the news website Rappler uncovered a network of trolls tied directly to government insiders.	比如，在挖掘谁给媒体造成最大威胁的最新系列报道中，新闻网站Rappler挖出一个与政府内部人士有直接关联的“黑子”网络。
Finally, journalists are working to improve the diversity of their own industry.	最后，记者也在致力于改善本行业的多样性。
In the Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, one media organization created a database with the contact details of thousands of female experts who are available for media commentary and analysis.	比如，刚果共和国的一家媒体组织建立了一个数据库，内有数千名可提供新闻评论和分析的女性专家的联系方式。
This simple exercise has led to a dramatic increase in the percentage of female experts appearing in the press.	这个简单的举措大大提高了女性专家出现在新闻中的百分比。
These are just a few of the bright spots we should be highlighting during this year’s observance of World Press Freedom Day.	这些只是我们应该在今年的世界新闻自由日活动中强调的闪光点的一小部分。
Every day, courageous men and women (and sometimes even children) around the world continue to brave the odds to bring us the news.	每一天，全世界勇敢的男人和女人们（有时甚至也包括儿童）都在不断冲破阻力，让我们看到新闻。
We all benefit from their dedication, and we all have an obligation to honor their successes, not just their sacrifices.	我们所有人都从他们的奉献中获益，我们所有人都有义务表彰他们的成功，而不仅仅是他们的牺牲。
	
Worlds Apart	分离的世界
Macroeconomic policies, financial globalization, and changes in labor market institutions have exacerbated inequality in recent decades, not only in income and wealth, but also in access to education, healthcare, social protection, as well as in political participation and influence.	宏观经济政策、金融全球化和劳力市场体制的变化加速了近几十年的不平等状况。 这种不平等不仅表现在收入和财富上，也表现在接受教育、医疗、社会保护以及政治参与和影响方面。
Even within countries experiencing rapid economic growth, an array of factors, exacerbated by tremendous demographic changes, has conspired to transmit inequality of knowledge, social responsibility, and life chances from one generation to the next.	即便是在经济快速发展的国家，由人口统计上的巨大变化所驱动的一系列因素，已经悄然将知识、社会责任和生活机会的不平等从一代人转移到下一代人。
As surveyed in the United Nations report The Inequality Predicament, few countries, rich or poor, have proved immune to the global trend of rising inequality, or to its consequences for education, health, and social welfare.	正如联合国的一份调查报告《不平等困境》中所示，不论贫富，几乎没有国家能够避免全球化大趋势和日益严重的不平等，或由这两者带来的教育、健康和社会福利方面的影响。
Of course, there is no simple causal relationship linking poverty and inequality to violence.	当然，在贫穷和不平等与暴力之间并没有一种简单而随意的联系。
But inequality and a sense of deprivation do contribute to resentment and social instability, threatening security.	但不平等和一种被剥夺感的确会引发怨恨情绪和社会不稳定，从而威胁到安全。
Excluded and facing bleak life prospects, young people, in particular, often experience anomie and may turn to anti-social behavior, including violence.	被排斥和面临暗淡的生活前景，尤其会使年轻人感到困惑无奈并可能诉诸包括暴力在内的反社会行为。
Nor is there a simple explanation of what causes poverty.	在造成贫困的原因方面也没有一个简单的解释。
Clearly, however, poverty arises from various complex conditions, and its amelioration requires a multidimensional approach.	然而，贫困显然是由不同复杂条件造成的，需要多管齐下来改善。
It is hard to imagine, for example, how to “make poverty history” without also generating enough decent work, educational opportunities, and healthcare for all.	比如，很难想象我们如何在没有为所有人提供足够的良好工作、教育机会和医疗保健的情况下 ， “ 创造扶贫的历史 ” 。
To be sure, the world has seen progress on some fronts in recent decades.	平心而论，近几十年，世界在一些方面取得了进步。
Access to education for girls has improved, and some gender gaps have been reduced.	女童接受教育的状况得到改善，有些性别鸿沟缩小了。
Despite AIDS and the resurgence of malaria and tuberculosis, life expectancy has increased in much of the world due to improved public health systems.	尽管有艾滋病和疟疾、肺结核的卷土重来，但由于公共医疗体系的改善，在世界很多地方人们的预期寿命都有所提高。
Overall, however, the inequality gaps are large and, in many cases, growing.	但总的说来，不平等的鸿沟仍然巨大，并仍在扩大之中。
The most important determinant of income inequality today is wealth inequality, with the increasing concentration of asset ownership in recent years principally responsible for greater income inequality in most countries.	当今收入不平等的决定性因素是财富不平等。 近几年愈演愈烈的产权集中化是造成大多数国家更严重收入不平等的首要因素。
Meanwhile, growing unemployment, widening skill and productivity gaps, and the “informalization” or “casualization” of labor markets have exacerbated income inequalities worldwide, as the number of “working poor” and the incidence of “jobless growth” has spread.	同时，随着“贫困劳工”和“无工作增长”的蔓延，日益严重的失业问题，日渐扩大的技能和生产力差距，和劳力市场的“非正式化”或“随意化”更加重了世界范围内的收入不平等。
Nor have stabilization and structural adjustment programs, imposed since the 1980’s, delivered on their promise of achieving higher economic growth.	从1980年代就开始实施的稳定和结构调整计划，也未能实现其所承诺地更高经济增长。
Growth in much of the world during the past quarter-century has been slower than in the previous 25 years, despite more rapid growth in East Asia, India, and a few other countries.	尽管有东亚、印度和其他几个国家的高速经济增长，世界许多地方在过去25年以来的经济增长还是慢于此前的25年。
Such growth differences suggest that overall global inequality may not have increased unequivocally.	这种增长差异表明全球的总体不平等可能并没有明确地加剧。
But inequalities at the national level have deepened in most countries in recent years, largely due to economic liberalization at both the national and international levels.	就国家层面而言，近几年，不平等在大多数国家都变得更为深刻。 这主要是由于在国家和国际层面上的经济自由化造成的。
Indeed, in much of the world, such economic reforms have actually undermined growth rates as well as the progressive role of government, while otherwise increasing overall inequalities.	的确，在世界的许多地方，这样的经济改革已经妨碍了经济增长和政府的推动作用，同时在其他方面增加了总体的不平等。
The few exceptions have been due largely to continued or new progressive government interventions.	少数几个例外主要是由于锐意改革的政府新近或持续性的干预。
But they are exceptions: the cumulative impact of these reforms over the past 25 years has been greater inequality in most developed and developing countries, with rising unemployment, greater earnings disparities, reduced social protection, and environmental degradation.	但他们仅仅是例外：过去25年来的经济改革的累积后果是在大多数发达国家和发展中国家造成更大的不平等、持续攀升的失业率、更大的收入差距、更弱的社会保护和环境恶化。
International financial liberalization, for example, has undermined the use of more inclusive and targeted developmental credit to promote desired economic activities.	例如，国际金融自由化已经妨碍了我们使用更具包容性和目的性的发展信贷来促进我们期望的经济活动。
In addition, contrary to the promises of its proponents, financial liberalization has actually resulted in net capital flows from the capital-poor to the capital-rich over the long term, while increasing financial volatility and weakening economic activity.	另外，与其支持者的承诺正好相反，长期而言，金融自由化实际上造成了净资本从资本穷国向资本富国流动，同时增加了金融不稳定性并弱化了经济活动。
Meanwhile, free-trade negotiations seem to ignore historical trends.	同时，自由贸易谈判似乎忽视了历史趋势。
Developing countries’ international terms of trade have worsened: prices of primary commodities have declined in relation to manufactures, as have tropical agriculture prices against temperate agriculture, and prices of generic manufactures have fallen relative to output protected by intellectual property rights.	发展中国家的国际贸易条件恶化了：与工业品相比的初级商品价格下跌，热带农产品的价格相对温带农产品下跌，普通工业品的价格也相对于受知识产权保护的产品下跌。
As a result, trade liberalization of manufactures has resulted in de-industrialization and greater unemployment in much of the world, as in the case of garments this year.	其结果，是工业品贸易自由化造成了世界许多地区地更高失业率和非工业化，就像今年的服装行业一样。
And, while agricultural trade liberalization may enhance export earnings for some poor countries, the main beneficiaries will be the more well-to-do agricultural exporters.	农业贸易自由化可能会增加有些穷国的出口创收，但主要的获益者将会是更富有的农业出口国。
Countries that import currently subsidized food will be worse off.	而目前进口享受补贴的食品的国家的情况将会恶化。
The “retreat of the state” in much of the developing world in recent decades has involved a generally reduced role for government, including the capacity to lead and sustain development, as well as its progressive social interventions in areas such as public education, health, housing, and utilities.	近几十年在许多发展中国家实行的“政府引退”造成了政府职能整体上的弱化，其中包括主导和维持发展的能力，以及在公共教育、健康、住房和公用事业方面的进步性社会干预。
The economic liberalization carried out in much of the world in the last 25 years was a flawed policy from the start, and its consequences have become glaringly obvious.	过去25年里，在世界许多地方实施的经济自由化先天不足，其后果触目惊心。
Unless the world refocuses economic policies to address the adverse impact of economic inequality on growth and poverty reduction, the poor and the privileged will continue to live worlds apart.	除非我们重新调整经济政策，以修正在增长和减轻贫困方面的经济不���等所带来的不良后果，否则穷人和富人会继续生活在两个不同世界之中。
	
Whither the Multilateral Trading System?	多边贸易体系将走向何方？
BRUSSELS – Free trade seems to have few supporters these days.	发自布鲁塞尔 — — 自由贸易的支持者最近好像没剩几个了。
Though actual trade volumes are recovering from the post-crisis recession and drop in commodity prices, “globalization” has become increasingly contentious, as exemplified by the election of US President Donald Trump on the back of a promise to rip up international agreements and get tough on trade partners.	尽管实际贸易量正在从危机后的衰退中复苏，大宗商品的价格也逐步下降，但是围绕“全球化”的争议却日益喧嚣，对此美国总统特朗普的当选就是明证 — — 此人的口号就是要撕毁国际协定并强硬对待贸易伙伴。
What does this mean for the future of the rules-based trading system?	那么对于基于规则的贸易体系来说，这又预示着一个什么样的未来？
Some 60 years ago, when the current rules-based global trading system was conceived, the United States was the world’s sole economic “hyperpower,” possessing unquestioned dominance in the day’s most advanced manufacturing industries.	大约60年前，也就是当前这个以规则为基础的全球贸易体系被构思出来的时候，美国是世界上唯一的经济“超级大国 ” ， 在当时最先进的制造产业中占据着无可置疑的主导地位。
With enough power to impose rules, and enough dominance to be able to count on accruing the largest share of the benefits, it could – and did – perform the role of “benevolent hegemon.”	既然有了足够的权力来施加规则，又有足够的统治力来确保获得最大的利益份额，它可以 （也确实）扮演着“仁慈的霸主”这一角色。
As Japan and Europe recovered from World War II – with the latter getting an added boost from economic integration – America’s lead began to dwindle, and by the 1970s and 1980s, the US was sharing power over the world’s trade agenda with Europe.	随着日本和欧洲从二战中复苏 — — 后者还得到了经济一体化的进一步推动，美国的领先优势开始缩小，到了1970年代和80年代，美国开始与欧洲分享制定世界贸易议程的权力。
Nonetheless, because the US and Europe share so many common interests, they generally adhered to a cooperative approach.	尽管如此，由于美欧之间存在着诸多共同利益，它们一般还会坚持走合作路线。
It was not until imports began to overwhelm a growing number of industries in the US, fueling the emergence of large and persistent external deficits, that the country’s trade policy became more defensive, creating friction with many of its partners.	但直到进口开始压垮越来越多的美国工业部门并刺激产生了巨额且持续的对外贸易逆差之后，该国的贸易政策才开始变得更加富有防御性，进而与许多合作伙伴产生摩擦。
Yet, even then, US leaders understood the value of the liberal multilateral trading system, and supported the establishment, in 1995, of the World Trade Organization as the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.	然而即使如此，美国领导人也清楚意识到自由主义多边贸易体系的价值，并支持在1995年建立世界贸易组织来作为关税和贸易总协定的接班人。
The WTO’s creation amounted to a major step forward, as it addressed not just tariffs, but also other trade barriers, including indirect barriers arising from domestic regulations.	世界贸易组织的创设堪称向前迈进的重要一步，因为它不仅应对关税问题，还处理其他贸易壁垒，包括那些因国内法规产生的间接壁垒。
Given the complexity of assessing how domestic regulations might impede trade, especially compared to judging whether a tariff has been correctly applied, the WTO needed effective dispute-settlement mechanisms, with members agreeing to binding arbitration.	鉴于评估国内法规贸易妨害程度的工作相对判断关税是否正确征收来说显得尤为复杂，世贸组织需要有效的争端解决机制以及得到成员国同意的有约束力仲裁机制。
The system worked, because its major members recognized the legitimacy of independent panels, even if they sometimes deliver politically inconvenient judgments.	这个制度最终奏效了，因为它的主要成员国都承认各个独立（仲裁）小组的合法性，即便后者有时会做出一些在政治上挺棘手的判决。
Yet this recognition is now increasingly in doubt.	然而这种认识如今却越来越遭到怀疑。
Consider what type of economy would support a rules-based system.	试问究竟有哪种什么类型的经济体会支持一套基于规则的体系呢？
After WWII, the US supported such a system, because of its unassailable economic supremacy.	二战后的美国支持这么一套体系，因为它拥有无与伦比的经济优势。
An open rules-based system would also be highly appealing in a world comprising only small countries, none of which could hope to gain by relying on its relative economic power.	一套以规则为基础的公开体系在一个只存在小国的世界中也是非常有吸引力的，因为这些国家都不可能依靠其相对的经济实力来获得好处。
Things become more complicated when the global economy includes a small number of economies of similar size, larger than the small economies from the previous example, but not large enough to dominate the system alone.	当全球经济涵盖了少数几个规模相近，比上文中的小经济体要大却又不足以单独控制整个体系的经济体时，事情就变得更复杂了。
That is the scenario the Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman considered in a 1989 paper on bilateralism, in which he reported that a world consisting of three major trading blocs constitutes the worst constellation for trade, as a lack of explicit cooperation among all three would lead to increasing trade barriers.	诺贝尔经济学奖得主保罗·克鲁格曼（Paul Krugman）在1989年发表的一篇关于双边主义的论文中指出一个由三大主要贸易集团组成的世界将会是最差劲的贸易组合，由于三者之间缺乏明确的合作关系，贸易壁垒将因此增加。
Unfortunately, this is exactly the situation in which the global economy finds itself today.	不幸的是，这正是全球经济的现状。
There are three dominant economies or trading blocs – China, the European Union, and the US – with very similar trade volumes (exports plus imports) of around $4 trillion each. (Japan, which was a strong contender 25 years ago, now has a much smaller trade volume.)	三大主要经济体/贸易集团 — — 中国，欧盟和美国 — — 的贸易量（出口量加进口量）都在4万亿美元左右（25年前的日本也是一个强有力的竞争者，但该国当前的贸易量就小太多了 ） 。
Together, the G3 economies account for 40% of world trade and 45% of global GDP.	三方经济体合共占据了世界贸易的40％以及全球GDP的45 ％ 。
With economic power distributed in this way, explicit cooperation by all three actors is crucial.	在经济权力如此分配的状态下，所有三个行动者的明确合作就变得至关重要了。
Yet there are compelling reasons why they would be reticent to pursue such cooperation.	但也有着令人信服的理由来解释为何各方都不愿意推进这类合作 ， 。
Even if Trump weren’t president, the current global trading system would present problems for the US, whose trade policy has long focused on manufactured goods. (Trade in raw materials has always been relatively free, and trade in agricultural goods has usually been considered special, and thus not subject to rules like the “most favored nation” principle, which applies to manufactures.)	即使特朗普不当选总统，目前的全球贸易体系也会给美国带来麻烦，因为美国的贸易政策长期以来都集中在制成品上（原料贸易一直都相对自由，农产品贸易通常被认为是特殊的，因此不受制于类似制造业“最惠国待遇”条款的那类规定 ） 。
Because the US is now self-sufficient in energy, it needs to export fewer manufactured goods than industrialized countries with no domestic energy resources.	由于美国现在能源上实现了自给，因此无须像那些缺乏国内能源供应的工业国家那样出口那么多的制成品。
Annual US exports of manufactured goods thus now amount to only about $1 trillion annually – significantly less than both the EU and China, which export almost twice as much in manufactured goods, despite having somewhat smaller economies.	当前美国的年均制成品出口额仅为1万亿美元左右，远低于欧盟和中国，后两者虽然经济规模略小，但各自的制成品出口额几乎是美国的两倍。
To be sure, Trump is unlikely to start an outright trade war, because any US tariff would harm the interests of the country’s largest companies, which have invested huge sums in production facilities abroad.	可以肯定的是，特朗普不太可能发起一场惊天动地的贸易战，因为美国施加的任何关税都会损害本国那些大型企业的利益 — — 它们在国外生产设施投资上可是花了大钱的。
Yet no individual firm will be willing to give up much of its political capital to defend the rules-based system, either, because it would have to bear the losses, while its competitors shared the gains.	同时也没有哪个企业愿意舍弃一大笔政治资本来维护基于规则的体系，因为它将不得不蒙受损失，而分享收益的却是竞争对手。
The same goes for the G3 trading blocs: if the EU expends political capital to stop the US from undermining WTO mechanisms, China (and the rest of world) will reap most of the gains.	三大贸易集团也是如此：如果欧盟花费政治资本阻止美国破坏WTO机制，最大的得益者就将是中国（以及世界其他地区 ） 。
That dynamic goes some way toward explaining why China’s leaders, despite having proclaimed their support for the multilateral rules-based trading system, haven’t taken concrete action to reinforce it.	这种动态有助于解释为何中国领导人虽然宣称支持以多边规则为基础的贸易体系，却一直未能采取具体行动来对其加以强化。
Their reticence is probably intensified by the assumption that, within the current generation, their country will dominate the global economy; at that point, they might no longer want to be bound by somebody else’s rules.	而令他们更倾向于保持缄默的可能是这么一个假设：在这一代人的时间内他们的国家将主宰全球经济；因此在这一点上，他们可能不再想受制于别人的规则。
It does not help matters that the Communist Party of China has recently been empowered even further in all areas of the economy, with all major firms now having to accept a CPC representative on their board.	更无奈的是中国共产党最近在国内各经济领域的权力都得到了进一步加强，以至于所有大企业如今都不得不接受在董事会里安插一个党代表席位。
It is difficult to see how a dominant economic power governed by a single party – especially one with such extensive control over the economy – would accept the primacy of international rules and procedures over domestic considerations.	很难想象一个由一党派执政的经济强国 — — 尤其一个对经济有着如此广泛控制的政党 — — 如何会让国际规则和程序凌驾于国内考虑因素之上。
The conclusion is clear. The world should prepare itself for the erosion of the rules-based trading system enshrined in the WTO.	结论其实很明确：世界是时候准备好迎来一个逐渐崩塌的WTO贸易体系了。
	
Ready or Not for the Next Recession?	准备好下一次衰退了吗？
COPENHAGEN – A sunny day is the best time to check whether the roof is watertight.	哥本哈根—艳阳天是检查天花板是否漏水最好的时候。
For economic policymakers, the proverbial sunny day has arrived: with experts forecasting strong growth, now is the best time to check whether we are prepared for the next recession.	对经济决策者来说，谚语中的艳阳天已经到来：专家们纷纷预测给力的增长，因此，这是检查我们是否为下一次衰退做好准备的最好时候。
The answer, for the United States in particular, is a resounding no.	答案 — — 特别是对美国而言 — — 是响亮的“否 ” 。
Policymakers normally respond to recessions by cutting interest rates, reducing taxes, and boosting transfers to the unemployed and other casualties of the downturn.	决策者应对衰退的通常手段是降低利率、减少税收以及提高面向失业者和其他衰退受害者的转移支付。
But the US is singularly ill-prepared, for a combination of economic and political reasons, to respond normally.	但由于各种经济和政治原因，美国完全没有做好常规应对准备。
Most obviously, the US Federal Reserve’s target for the federal funds rate is still only 1.25%-1.5%.	最显而易见的是，美联储联邦基金利率目标仍然只有1.25 % — 1.5 % 。
If no recession is imminent, the Fed may succeed in raising rates three times by the end of the year, to around 2%.	如果近期不发生衰退，美联储可能到今年年底成功升息三次至2%左右。
But that would still leave little room for monetary easing in response to recessionary trends before the policy rate hits zero again.	但如果发生衰退性趋势，货币宽松到政策利率为零的程度仍然是杯水车薪。
In the last three recessions, the Fed’s cumulative interest-rate cuts have been close to five full percentage points.	在过去三次衰退中，美联储累计降息幅度都接近整整五个百分点。
This time, because slow recovery has permitted only gradual normalization of interest rates, and because there appears to have been a tendency for interest rates to trend downward more generally, the Fed lacks room to react.	这一次，由于慢复苏导致利率只能逐渐正常化，并且出现了一般性的利率下降趋势，美联储行动空间十分有限。
In principle, the Fed could launch another round of quantitative easing.	理论上，美联储可以发动新一轮量化宽松。
In addition, at least one of US President Donald Trump’s nominees to the Federal Reserve Board has mooted the idea of negative interest rates.	此外，在美国总统特朗普所提名的美联储理事人选中，至少有一人提出过负利率的概念。
That said, this Fed board, with its three Trump appointees, is likely to be less activist and innovative than its predecessor.	尽管如此，包括三位特朗普任命人选在内的美联储理事会不太可能会比上一届更加积极和创新。
And criticism by the US Congress of any further expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet would be certain and intense.	美国国会也肯定会激烈地批评美联储的任何进一步扩大资产负债表的举动。
Fiscal policy is the obvious alternative, but Congress has cut taxes at the worst possible time, leaving no room for stimulus when it is needed.	财政政策是显而易见的替代方案，但国会在最糟糕的时候选择了减税，这使得真正需要的时候不再有刺激空间。
Adding $1.5 trillion more to the federal debt will create an understandable reluctance to respond to a downturn with further tax cuts.	让联邦债务增加1.5万亿美元将产生对衰退时期进一步减税的抵制反应，这一点不难理解。
As my Berkeley colleagues Christina and David Romer have shown, fiscal policy is less effective in countering recessions, and less likely to be used, when a country has already incurred a high public debt.	我的伯克利同事卡里斯蒂娜·罗默和大卫·罗默（Christina and David Romer）指出，如果一国已经积累了很高的公共债务，那么财政政策在抵御衰退方面效果较低，采用的可能性也较小。
Instead of stimulating the economy in the next downturn, the Republicans in Congress are likely to respond perversely.	国会中的共和党不太可能在下一次衰退中采取刺激经济的手段，而是会表现得更加顽固。
As revenues fall and the deficit widens even faster, they will insist on spending cuts to return the debt trajectory to its previous path.	随着收入的下降和赤字更快的增加，他们将把减支进行到底，让债务轨迹重回此前的轨道。
Congressional Republicans will most likely start with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food to low-income households.	国会共和党最有可能拿补充营养援助计划（Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program，SNAP）开刀。 SNAP是一项低收入家庭提供食物的计划，目前已经被国会共和党盯上。
SNAP is already in their sights. They will then proceed to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.	接着，他们会把砍刀挥向医疗保险（Medicare ） 、 医疗补助（Medicaid）和社会保险。
The burden of these spending cuts will fall on hand-to-mouth consumers, who will reduce their own spending dollar for dollar, denting aggregate demand.	这些减支措施的负担将落在无隔宿之粮的消费者头上，他们将一点一点地减少支出，从而拖累总需求。
For their part, state governments, forced by new limits on the deductibility of state and local taxes to pare their budgets, are likely to move further in the direction of limiting the duration of unemployment benefits and the extent of their own food and nutrition assistance.	至于州政府，迫于州和地方税抵扣的新限制吞噬了它们的预算，有可能进一步降低失业救济的领取时间，限制自身食品和营养补助的范围。
Nor will global conditions favor the US.	全球环境也不利于美国。
Foreign central banks, from Europe to Japan, have similarly scant room to cut interest rates. Even after a government in Germany is finally formed, policymakers there will continue to display their characteristic reluctance to use fiscal policy.	从欧洲到日本，外国央行也没有多少降息空间，即使德国政府最终组建成功，德国决策者也将继续其不喜欢动用财政政策的特点。
And if Germany doesn’t use its fiscal space, there will be little room for its eurozone partners to do so.	而如果德国不利用其财政空间，其欧元区伙伴国也将没有财政空间可用。
More than that, scope for the kind of international cooperation that helped to halt the 2008-2009 contraction has been destroyed by Trump’s “America First” agenda, which paints one-time allies as enemies.	不仅如此，帮助遏制了2008—2009年经济萎缩的国际合作已经被特朗普的“美国优先”日程毁于一旦。 “美国优先”方针将曾经的盟友列为敌人。
Other countries will work with the US government to counter the next recession only if they trust its judgment and intentions.	要想让其他国家和美国政府共同抵抗下一次衰退，唯有让它们相信它的判断和意图。
And trust in the US may be the quantity in shortest supply.	而对美国的信任度供给量严重短缺。
In 2008-2009, the Fed extended dollar swap lines to foreign central banks, but came under congressional fire for “giving away” Americans’ hard-earned money.	2008—2009年期间，美联储扩大了与外国央行的美元互换规模，但被国会抨击为“拱手送出”美国人民的辛苦钱。
Then, at the London G20 summit in early 2009, President Barack Obama’s administration made a commitment to coordinate its fiscal stimulus with that of other governments.	接着，在2009年年初的伦敦G20峰会上，总统奥巴马政府承诺与其他政府进行财政政策协作。
Today, almost a decade later, it is hard to imagine the Trump administration even showing up at an analogous meeting.	在金十年后的今天，很难想象特朗普政府会在类似的会议上哪怕是露一脸。
The length of an economic expansion is not a reliable predictor of when the next downturn will come.	经济扩张的长度并非下一次衰退何时到来的可靠预测指标。
And the depth and shape of that recession will depend on the event triggering it, which is similarly uncertain.	而衰退的深度和性质将取决于触发衰退的事件，同样具有不确定性。
The one thing we know for sure, though, is that expansions don’t last forever.	尽管如此，有一件事是笃定的，即，扩张不会永远持续下去。
A storm will surely come, and when it does, we will be poorly prepared for the deluge.	风暴肯定会到来，而当它真的来临时，我们将完全没有做好应对洪水的准备。
	
An Opportunity for the WTO	世贸组织的一个良机
ONTARIO – This December, trade ministers from around the world will converge in Buenos Aires for the World Trade Organization’s 11th Ministerial Conference.	发自安大略 — — 十二月，世界各地的贸易部长将齐聚布宜诺斯艾利斯参加世界贸易组织（WTO）第十一次部长级会议。
With the United States, which has historically led the world toward trade liberalization, now actively stoking trade tensions, the meeting is set to be unlike any other.	但本届会议注定与往届有所不同，因为美国这个一直以来引领全球迈向贸易自由化的国家如今却在积极挑动贸易紧张局势了。
The WTO’s ministerial gatherings are never easy.	世贸组织部长级会议永远都不那么顺利。
Some kind of agreement is usually delivered, but only at the last minute, and its language is often vague.	会上通常能达成某些协议，但往往要等到最后一刻才形成共识，协议用词也大多模棱两可。
This time, however, the outcome might be even more disappointing, with delegates unable to reach even a symbolic agreement that they can tout with an aggressive marketing campaign.	然而本届结果可能更令人失望，代表们甚至无法达成一个令他们可以在大型选举造势活动中为自己脸上贴金的象征性协议。
The current tensions over free trade, rooted in the uneven distribution of its benefits, cannot be resolved within the WTO, let alone by a ministerial gathering.	目前自由贸易中的紧张局势源自于各方收益的分配不均，而这无法在WTO框架内解决，更不可能在部长级会议上找到答案。
But that doesn’t mean that the upcoming conference must be for naught.	但这并不意味着即将到来的会议注定毫无意义。
On the contrary, it should serve as a critical opportunity to initiate the update and recalibration that the WTO needs to remain an effective platform for international trade cooperation and consensus-building.	相反，如果世贸组织想要保持自身作为国际贸易合作和共识构建有效平台的地位，就必须借助这个关键机会实施所需的更新和重整。
One key problem that must be addressed relates to “special and differential treatment” (S&D).	其中必须解决的一个关键问题与“特殊和差别性待遇”有关。
About two thirds of the WTO’s 164 members have declared themselves developing countries – a label that entitles them to S&D provisions, including the authority to maintain trade tariffs for a longer period of time.	世贸组织164个成员中有2/3宣称自己是发展中国家，这个标签使他们有权获得一些优待，包括在更长时期内收取贸易关税的权力。
With the WTO lacking any benchmarks or indicators to determine when a country should be weaned off S&D, it is no surprise that no developing country has ever “developed.”	由于世贸组织并没有任何基准或指标来确定一个国家何时应该脱离特殊和差别性待遇，因此没有任何发展中国家会变成“发达 ” 。
To be sure, since S&D was first introduced in 1979, many developing countries have grown richer. But they have shown no indication that they are ready to relinquish the benefits of S&D, even for industries that have become internationally competitive.	但自从1979年首次引进该条款以来，许多发展中国家早已发展壮大，可即便其国内某些行业已经具备国际竞争力，它们也没打算放弃这类优待所带来的利益。
It is hard to argue that all developing countries should enjoy the indefinite privilege of opting out of the WTO’s general obligations for all sectors of their economies.	很难说所有发展中国家都应享有无限期特权来避免承担世贸组织对其经济中所有部门所下达的一般义务。
And with so many of their WTO partners claiming preferential status, developed-country members often resist trade concessions within the organization, preferring to conduct negotiations in other forums.	而由于太多世贸组织合作伙伴都声称享有优惠地位，发达国家成员国往往会抵制组织框架内的贸易让步，而更愿意在其他平台上展开谈判。
The dynamic in the WTO stands in stark contrast to that within the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.	而世贸组织内部的动态则与国际货币基金组织和世界银行形成了鲜明对比。
At the WTO, developed countries would like to see big emerging markets take on more obligations, while developing countries resist. At the Bretton Woods institutions, developed countries are blocking emerging economies from gaining greater influence.	在世贸组织中，发达国家希望看到各大新兴市场国家承担更多的义务，而发展中国家则抵制；在布雷顿森林体系机构内，发达国家却在遏制新兴经济体获得更大的影响力。
But the two dynamics have something in common: intransigence, even if coming from different quarters, reflects a denial of reality.	但这两股动态存在一些共同点：即使来自不同阵营，却都反映了对现实的否定。
In the Bretton Woods institutions, the emerging economies are right that their increased economic weight should correlate with larger capital contributions and more weight in decision-making.	在布雷顿森林体系机构中，新兴经济体不断增大的经济体量应当与更大的出资比重和决策权重相关联。
In the WTO, S&D clearly needs to be updated to ensure that it benefits only countries that actually need it.	世贸组织的优待条款显然也需要更新，确保只有那些真正有需要的国家才能受益。
Ministers at the conference in Buenos Aires should thus be prepared to have an honest discussion about S&D.	因此布宜诺斯艾利斯会议的部长们应该准备针对优待条款展开诚布公的讨论。
A second topic that the WTO needs to address relates to consensus-building.	世贸组织需要处理的第二个议题涉及到共识的建立。
Under current WTO rules, most decisions can be adopted by a majority vote.	根据当前的世贸组织规则，大多数决策都可以通过多数赞成票来达成。
But the long-standing practice has been to adopt all decisions by consensus.	但长期以来的做法是以协商一致的方式来通过所有决策。
This is wise and should not change.	这是明智且无须改变的。
Though consensus-building can be slow and cumbersome, it is the only way to generate the legitimacy that WTO decisions need.	虽然建立共识可能冗长而繁琐，但这是世贸组织决策获取所需合法性的唯一途径。
A simple majority vote, after all, would fail to account for differences in market size.	毕竟简单的多数投票将无法体现市场规模的差异。
And weighted voting would undermine the WTO’s capacity to settle disputes by adjudicating rights and obligations among members of different size and political heft.	而加权投票则会破坏世贸组织通过对不同规模和政治影响力的成员之间的权利和义务进行裁定来解决争端的能力。
The problem is that consensus is interpreted as an unlimited veto power, such that a member can block any discussion on matters of interest to others.	但问题在于共识被曲解成了无限制的否决权，这样一个成员就可以阻止别人去讨论一切事关他人利益的问题。
A consensus-based approach can work only if it entails an obligation by all members to work toward shared interests, with members objecting formally only to decisions running counter to some fundamental interest.	如果某项共识能赋予所有成员国责任去追求共同利益，那么寻求公识的手段才能起作用，因为成员国只会对与某些根本利益相违背的决定提出正式反对。
The Paris climate agreement was made possible by a simple method called “Indaba,” adopted from the Zulu and Xhosa people of South Africa. Negotiators had the right to withhold consent, but only if they put forth alternate proposals aimed at finding common ground.	巴黎气候协议就是借助南非祖鲁和科萨人称为“因达巴会议（Indaba ） ” 的简单方法达成的 — — 谈判者有权拒绝共识，但只能是在提出旨在寻求共同点的替代建议之后。
If Indaba worked in Paris, it could also work at the WTO.	如果因达巴可以在巴黎奏效，那么当然也可以用在世贸组织上。
In Buenos Aires, ministers should discuss how to ensure that WTO members responsibly exercise their right to block decisions.	在布宜诺斯艾利斯，部长们应讨论如何确保世贸组织成员负责地行使其否决权。
The final issue that ministers should be prepared to discuss in Buenos Aires is the need to ensure that the WTO adapts effectively to a changing international environment.	部长们应该在布宜诺斯艾利斯讨论的最后一个问题是如何确保世贸组织能有效适应不断变化的国际环境。
The problems with both S&D and consensus decision-making at the WTO are not new, but they have long been ignored, allowing them to deepen.	世贸组织的特殊和差别性待遇以及共识决策问题长期存在，却又一直被忽视以致不断恶化。
This would not have happened if incremental reform was ingrained in the WTO’s regular activities.	如果渐进式改革能根植于世贸组织的日常活动中，这种情况就不会发生了。
Both the IMF and the World Bank have policy watchdogs that regularly scrutinize and evaluate their functioning.	国际货币基金组织和世行都有设有政策监督机构来定期审查和评估自身的运作。
Running on very small budgets, these ruthless truth-tellers regularly force their institutions’ leaders to have honest discussions about organizational effectiveness and possible reforms.	这些真相的无情揭露者不需多少运行经费，却能经常迫使本机构的领导层就组织效率和可能实施的改革开展诚恳的讨论。
Such an independent office for evaluation is precisely what the WTO needs.	而这样一个独立评估办公室正是世贸组织所需要的。
The WTO cannot sweep its problems under the carpet forever.	世贸组织不可能永远掩盖自己的问题。
The question is whether it will undertake the reforms it needs now or wait until a costly crisis leaves it no choice.	问题在于它能否立刻进行所需的改革，还是等待一场巨大的危机将其逼到墙角。
	
The WTO Reborn?	世贸组织重生？
NEW DELHI – For too long, the World Trade Organization has languished, to lift a reference from T.S. Eliot, by the “waters of Leman” (Lake Geneva).	新德里—世界贸易组织已经黯然失色了太长时间，用艾略特的话说，是因为“莱曼之水 ” （ 日内瓦湖 ） 。
Once the world’s preeminent multilateral trade forum, the WTO has been steadily marginalized in recent years, and recent rebukes of globalization, such as the United Kingdom’s Brexit vote and the election of Donald Trump as US president, suggest that this trend will accelerate.	作为昔日杰出的多边贸易论坛，世贸组织在最近几年逐渐被边缘化，而最近对全球化的反动 — — 如英国的退欧公投和特朗普当选美国总统 — — 表明这一趋势还将加速。
But these outcomes may actually have the opposite effect, owing to three key developments that could enable the revival of the WTO – and of the multilateralism that it embodies.	但这些结果实际上可能起到相反的效果，因为三个重要发展态势可能让世贸组织 — — 以及它所代表的多边主义 — — 重塑昔日辉煌。
The first development is the decline of alternative trade arrangements.	第一个发展态势是替代性贸易安排的式微。
The WTO reached its peak in the early 2000s, a few years after the Uruguay Round of global trade negotiations concluded, and a time when more countries – most notably China – were acceding to the organization.	世贸组织在21世纪初达到顶峰，当是时，全球贸易谈判乌拉圭回合刚刚在几年前结束，更多的国家 — — 最引人注目的是中国 — — 答应加入该组织。
But major trade players like the United States and the European Union subsequently shifted their focus from multilateral trade agreements to bilateral, regional, and mega-regional deals.	但美国和欧盟等主要贸易方随后将注意力从多边贸易协定转向了双边、地区和大地区协议。
The mega-regionals – namely, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) – posed a particularly grave threat to the WTO.	大地区协议 — — 即跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（TPP）和跨大西洋贸易和投资伙伴关系（TTIP ） — —给世贸组织造成了特别巨大的威胁。
Yet those are precisely the deals that the Trump administration is rejecting, or at least postponing.	但特朗普政府正是要和这些协议说“不 ” ， 至少要将它们搁置起来。
European integration had a similar impact on the WTO, as it provided an alternative platform for managing intra-European trade.	欧洲一体化也对世贸组织造成了类似的影响，因为它提供了一个新的管理欧洲内部贸易的平台。
But the European project has fallen on hard times, the most salient sign being the UK’s impending departure from the EU.	但欧洲工程已经步履维艰，英国即将脱离欧盟就是明证。
After Brexit, the WTO will probably become an important forum for Britain’s trade relations with the world.	英国退欧之后，世贸组织也许将成为英国与世界贸易关系的重要论坛。
Any further disintegration of the EU will only bolster that trend.	欧盟的进一步解体都将强化这一趋势。
Of course, it is possible that regional trade agreements in Asia and elsewhere will continue to flourish.	当然，有可能亚洲和其他地方的地区贸易协定仍将继续兴盛。
But new leadership would have to emerge.	但必须出现新的领导者。
And no single systemically important country today meets the rigorous requirements of such leadership: internal political stability, economic dynamism, relatively contained risk, and a steadfast commitment to open markets.	而如今没有一个具有系统重要性的国家可以单枪匹马满足这一领导力的严格要求：内政稳定、经济有活力，风险相对受控，坚定致力于开放市场。
However counterintuitive that may sound, a second development that bodes well for the WTO’s revival is voters’ increasing rejection of hyper-globalization.	听起来似乎与直觉相反，第二个可以作为世贸组织复兴之福的发展态势是越来越多的选民开始拒绝超全球化（hyper-globalization ） 。
Hyper-globalization is essentially “deep” integration.	超全球化从本质上即“深度”一体化。
It goes beyond creating open markets for goods and services to include increased immigration (in the US and Europe), harmonizing regulations (the ambition of the TPP and the TTIP), and intrusive adjudication of domestic policies (the investor-settlement procedures under NAFTA and the TPP).	它不仅包括为商品和服务创造开放市场以容纳更多的移民（在美国和欧洲 ） 、 调和监管（TPP和TTIP的雄心）和对国内政策侵略式裁判（北美贸易自由协定和TPP规定的投资者和解程序 ） 。
In the EU’s case, it even entails a common currency.	在欧盟的例子中，它甚至包括了共同货币。
For such integration, regionalism is much more effective than the WTO.	对于这样的一体化，再地区化远比世贸组织更有效。
Now that “deep” is out, the WTO could once again become an attractive forum for trading countries to do business.	如今 ， “ 深度”已是明日黄花，世贸组织有望重新成为有吸引力的论坛，为各贸易国提供生意机会。
Make no mistake: there will still be a lot of globalization for the WTO to facilitate and manage, not least because of the inexorable march of technology.	不要搞错了：因为技术的无情的进步，世贸组织仍要为全球化提供大量便利和管理。
The mesh-like structure of trade and investment connecting countries, embodied in global value-chains – what Aaditya Mattoo of the World Bank and I have called “criss-crossing globalization” – will prevent significant backsliding.	贸易和投资的网状结构将各国联系在一起，嵌入全球价值链 — — 世界银行的阿迪特亚·马图（Aaditya Mattoo）和我称之为“十字交叉全球化 ” — —这能够防止大溃败。
The third development that could reinvigorate the WTO is a more protectionist stance by the Trump administration.	第三个有望重振世贸组织的发展态势是特朗普政府所采取了更加保护主义的立场。
If the US raises tariffs or implements a border-adjustment tax favoring exports and penalizing imports, its trade partners are likely to turn to the WTO for adjudication, given the organization’s demonstrated dispute-settlement capability.	如果美国提高关税，或征收边境调节税以奖励出口、惩罚进口，其贸易伙伴可能转向世贸组织要求作出裁决，因为该组织拥有经过了证明的纠纷解决能力。
The WTO could, therefore, become the place where US trade policies are scrutinized and kept in check.	因此，世贸组织有望成为美国贸易政策得到检查和制约的场合。
The universality of WTO membership, previously seen as an impediment to countries eager to move ahead with new rules and agreements, could be its main strength, as it implies a high degree of legitimacy, which is essential to minimize trade tensions and the risk of conflict.	世贸组织成员的普遍性曾经被视为渴望采取新规则和协定的国家的一大障碍，现在可能成为其主要优势，因为这意味着很高的合法性，而这是贸易紧张和冲突风险最小化的关键。
In my book Eclipse, I argued that multilateralism offered the best means for ensuring the peaceful rise of new powers.	在我的书《日蚀 》 （ Eclipse）中，我指出多边主义提供了确保新力量和平崛起的最佳方式。
But it seems that the same argument could apply equally well to the management of receding powers.	但似乎同样的观点也适用于管理衰落力量。
But the WTO’s revival will not happen automatically.	但世贸组织的复兴不会自动发生。
Willing stakeholders must actively pursue it.	有意愿的相关利益方必须积极追求这一结果。
The most obvious candidates for the job are the mid-size economies that have been the greatest beneficiary of globalization, and that, unlike the US and some European countries, are not currently under pressure from a globalization-averse public.	最显而易见的候选者是已是全球化最大受益者的中等规模经济体，以及 — — 不同于美国和一些欧洲国家 — — 目前未受到讨厌全球化的公众的压力的经济体。
The champions of multilateralism should include Australia, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and possibly China and Japan.	多边主义的主力军应该包括澳大利亚、巴西、印度、印尼、墨西哥、新西兰、南非和英国，可能还有中国和日本。
Because none of them is large (with the exception of China), they must work collectively to defend open markets.	由于它们都不是大经济体（中国除外 ） ， 因此它们必须团结起来捍卫开放市场。
Moreover, they must open their own markets not only in the traditional areas of agriculture and manufacturing, but also in new areas such as services, investments, and standards.	此外，它们必须开放资深市场，不仅包括农业和制造业等传统领域，也包括服务业、投资和标准等新领域。
In doing so, these countries would also be responding to the increasingly transactional approach to sustaining openness that the larger traders are being compelled to adopt.	如此，这些国家也可以对应日益交易性的、保持大贸易方被迫采取的开放的方法。
The world needs a robust response to the decline of hyper-globalization.	世界需要强力面对超全球化的衰落。
Multilateralism, championed by mid-size trading economies with a strong interest in preserving openness, may be it.	能从保护开放性中获得重大利益的中型贸易经济体所引领的多边主义或许是应对方法之一。
To the shores of Leman they must now head.	它们必须抵达莱曼之水的彼岸。
	
Putin on Parade	游行中的普京
NEW YORK – This May’s parade in Moscow to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II promises to be the greatest Victory Day celebration since the Soviet Union’s collapse.	纽约 — — 今年五月即将在莫斯科举行的二战结束70周年纪念游行有望成为苏联解体以来规模最大的胜利日庆祝活动。
Some 16,000 soldiers, 200 armored vehicles, and 150 planes and helicopters are set to pass through and over Red Square.	大约16,000名士兵、200辆装甲车和150架飞机和直升机将穿越红场地面和上空。
It will be a scene that would easily have been familiar to Soviet leaders like Leonid Brezhnev and Nikita Khrushchev, taking the salute atop Lenin’s tomb.	勃列日涅夫和赫鲁晓夫等苏联领导人曾非常熟悉向红场列宁墓致敬的场景。
Yet, though Russia’s WWII allies were from Europe and North America, no Western leaders will attend the commemoration – a reflection of the West’s disapproval of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea.	但虽然俄罗斯二战盟国均来自欧洲和北美，但西方领导人却不会出席纪念活动 — — 这是西方对普京入侵乌克兰及吞并克里米亚不满的反映。
Instead, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s high-profile guests will include the leaders of China, India, and North Korea, underscoring just how few friends Russia has these days.	相反，俄总统弗拉基米尔·普京的高规格嘉宾包括中国、印度和朝鲜领导人，这凸显了当今俄国鲜有同盟的孤立环境。
The surreal nature of this gathering reflects the increasingly bizarre nature of Putin’s regime.	此次超现实主义聚会是普京政权怪诞现实的反映。
Indeed, watching Russia nowadays is like watching the last installment of the X-Men film franchise, “Days of Future Past.”	事实上，看现在的俄罗斯就像在看最后一集X战警《未来昔日 》 。
Just as the X-Men in that film join forces with their younger selves to save mankind’s future, today’s Kremlin is harking back to Russia’s Soviet past in what it sees as a contemporary fight for the country’s survival.	正像影片中的X战警与年轻的自己联手拯救人类未来一样，今天的克里姆林宫正试图借助过去苏联的力量来打赢俄罗斯的现代生存战争。
Critical to this strategy is propaganda conflating the West today with the Germans who invaded Russia in 1941, while painting Ukrainian government officials as “fascists” and “neo-Nazis.”	上述战略的关键是将今天的西方与1941年入侵俄国的德国混为一谈，同时把乌克兰政府官员描绘成“法西斯”和“新纳粹分子 ” 。
The Kremlin has relied on such claims, together with the supposed need to defend Russians abroad, to justify its aggression against Ukraine.	克里姆林正是依靠这样的说法和保护海外俄国人的所谓必要性来为侵略乌克兰寻找借口。
In Putin’s speech following the annexation of Crimea, he charged that the West’s refusal “to engage in dialogue” left Russia with no choice.	在吞并克里米亚后的讲话中，普京指责西方国家拒绝“参与对话”令俄罗斯别无选择。
“We are constantly proposing cooperation on all key issues,” he declared.	普京称“我们不断在所有关键问题上寻求合作 ” 。
“We want to strengthen our level of trust and for our relations to be equal, open, and fair.	“我们希望强化信任，让关系平等、开放、公正。
But we saw no reciprocal steps.”	但我们没有看到西方采取相应的步骤。
A month later, Putin reinforced this image of Russians as the morally superior victims of a cruel and uncompromising West.	一个月后，普京再次强调俄罗斯是残酷且拒绝妥协的西方在道德上具有优越感的受害者。
“We are less pragmatic than other people, less calculating,” he asserted, before adding that Russia’s “greatness” and “vast size” means “we have a more generous heart.”	普京称“我们不像其他人那么务实算计 ” ， 他还补充说俄罗斯的“伟大”和“广阔疆域”让我们“更加大度和宽容 ” 。
It is not difficult to see the parallels between Putin’s approach and that of Joseph Stalin, who declared at the start of WWII that the “enemy” aims to “destroy” Russia’s “national culture,” to “Germanize” its people, and “convert them into slaves.”	不难看出普京和斯大林的做法有相似之处，后者曾在二战伊始宣布“敌人”想要“消灭”俄罗斯“民族文化 ” 、 将俄国人“德国化”并奴役俄国民众。
The difference, of course, is that the Nazi Wehrmacht actually invaded the Soviet Union, whereas Ukraine simply wanted to decide its own future.	当然，不同之处是德国国防军的确入侵了苏联，而乌克兰不过想要主宰自己的命运。
Without defending Stalin, one must recognize the immense Soviet contribution – including the lives of 26 million citizens – to the Allied victory in WWII.	即使一点不为斯大林辩护，人们也必须承认苏联对二战盟军胜利的巨大贡献 — — 包括2，600万民众为此献出生命。
At the time, the military parade in Red Square – featuring almost 35,000 troops, up to 1,900 pieces of military equipment, and a 1,400-man orchestra – was a well-deserved pageant.	当时的红场阅兵 — — 约有步兵35，000人、军事装备1，900件、乐队1，400人 — — 可谓一场当之无愧的盛宴。
The Soviet leadership spared no cost in staging its military displays, which, in the absence of an external military threat, became an important vehicle for rallying national unity.	苏联领导层不遗余力地展示军力，那次阅兵在没有外来军事威胁的情况下，成为凝聚民族团结的重要手段。
After the Soviet Union’s collapse, Russia, no longer a superpower, put its military spectacles on ice.	��联解体后，俄罗斯不再是超级大国，也因此暂停举办阅兵式。
But in 2005, to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of WWII, Putin held a major parade – one that Western leaders, believing that Russia might have a European future, did attend.	但2005年，为纪念二战结束60周年，普京举办了盛大阅兵式 — — 当时西方领导人相信俄罗斯未来可能加入欧洲，并因此出席了那次阅兵式。
The tone of this year’s Victory Day commemorations is far less anticipatory.	今年胜利日纪念活动的气氛远不及预期。
How can one celebrate the end of a war at a time when the descendants of those who fought it (undoubtedly driven by the hope that future generations would live in peace) are killing one another in a brutal little war in eastern Ukraine?	怎么能在战争英雄（推动他们打这场战争的是希望子孙后代能够和平生活）后代在东乌克兰残酷的局部战争中互相残杀的情况下庆祝战争的胜利？
What is the point of grandiose fireworks displays amid the firing of real howitzers and rockets?	在榴弹炮和火箭纷飞之际宏伟的烟花表演能有什么意义？
The historian Robert Paxton believed that one could tell much about a country by its parades.	历史学家罗伯特·帕克斯顿相信游行能在很大程度上反映国家的面貌。
His 1966 book Parades and Politics at Vichy describes how Philippe Pétain, as Chief of State of Vichy France, used pageantry, reactionary politics, and, of course, a partnership with Adolf Hitler to dupe his defeated country into believing that it still mattered in the world.	他1996年的著作《维希的游行和政治》讲述了担任法国维希政府首脑的菲利普·贝当用华丽、反动的政治策略，当然还有与希特勒的联盟来欺骗战败的祖国，让其相信自己在世界事务中仍有一席之地。
The Vichy state’s brand of authoritarian traditionalism lionized family and fatherland, with Pétain, a former military commander, serving as a kind of military king, exalted on the tribune.	作为维希政府标志的专制传统主义让家族和祖国流芳千古，而前军事指挥官贝当则扮演着某种军事王者的角色，并被抬上神圣的讲坛。
The parallels with Putin’s Russia are clear.	维希政府与普京领导下俄罗斯的相似之处显而易见。
Putin views himself as a new czar.	普京以新沙皇自居。
His KGB background dictates his leadership style, which includes the abolition of free and fair elections, the persecution of opponents, and the promotion of conservative values that he, like Pétain before him, juxtaposes with the corrupting influence of an “immoral” and “decadent” West.	他的克格勃背景决定了他的领导风格，包括取消自由公正选举，迫害反对派以及宣传保守的价值观。 就像曾经的贝当一样 ， “ 非道德”和“颓废”的西方腐败深深影响着普京。
Relying on this approach, Putin has built alliances with the likes of Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad and Egypt’s military ruler Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.	依靠这种方法，普京已与叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德和埃及军事统治者阿卜杜勒·法塔赫·塞西结成联盟。
China, the world’s second largest economy, is a useful addition to this collection of friendly anti-democratic states, as it has its own strategic grievances with the West.	全世界第二大经济体中国因为有其自身对西方的战略不满，成为对友好反民主国家联盟的有益补充。
Unlike China, however, Russia is not a rising superpower.	但不同于中国的是，俄罗斯并不是崛起中的超级大国。
Putin may try to portray his actions in Ukraine as a fight against fascism.	普京可能想把乌克兰行动描绘成一场反法西斯斗争。
But it is really a fight for relevance – a fight he will never win.	但它实际是争夺影响力的战斗 — — 在这场战斗中他根本不可能获胜。
No matter how grand the parade, he cannot hide the truth: Russia’s days as a superpower are in the past.	无论阅兵式多么盛大都无法掩盖真相：俄罗斯作为超级大国的历史已经一去不复返。
Putin’s patriotism, like Pétain’s, is that of the vanquished.	普京的爱国主义像贝当一样属于被征服者。
	
Xi’s Strong Hand Against Trump	习近平对特朗普的强手
LONDON – The world will soon witness a historic test of wills between China and the United States, two superpowers whose leaders see themselves as supreme.	伦敦—世界将目睹中国和美国之间的历史性考验，这两个超级大国的领导人都自视为超级领袖。
In the immediate sense, it will be a battle over trade.	眼下，这场考验将是贸易战。
But also at stake is the strategic leadership of East Asia and, eventually, the international order.	但同样有可能成为斗争对象的还有东亚以及最终的国际秩序的战略领导地位。
As things stand, China holds a stronger position than many people realize.	目前，中国手牌之强超乎许多人的意料。
The question is whether Chinese President Xi Jinping will feel confident or brazen enough to want to prove it.	问题在于中国国家主席习近平会充满自信还是会“任性”地想要证明这一点。
The test of wills was hardly China’s choice; but nor does it come as a surprise.	意志的考验向来不是中国的选择；但这也不是什么令人意外的事。
US President Donald Trump’s recently announced import tariffs on steel, aluminum, and other Chinese-made goods are in keeping with his brand of economic nationalism.	美国总统特朗普最近宣布对钢、铝和其他中国制造产品征收关税，这与他经济民族主义的名声倒是相符。
And his decision to accept North Korea’s invitation to hold bilateral talks on its nuclear program reflects the same “bring it on” attitude that he applied to the North’s earlier threats of war.	他还决定接受朝鲜的邀请，就朝鲜核计划进行双边对话，这反映了与他此前应对朝鲜战争威胁时相同的“放马过来”态度。
The upcoming test will be historic because it promises to reveal the true strengths and attitudes of the world’s rising power vis-à-vis the weakened but still leading incumbent power. For better or worse, the result could shape the world for decades to come.	即将到来的考验之所以是历史性的，是因为它有可能揭示世界崛起强国对已削弱但仍起着领导作用的现任强国的真正优势和态度。
On the trade front, China’s large bilateral surplus with the US could mean that it has more to lose from a trade war, simply because it has more exports that can be penalized.	在贸易方面，中国对美国保持巨大的双边盈余，这意味着它在贸易战中可以输的东西更多，因为它有更多的出口可以被惩罚。
It is often said that surplus countries will always be the biggest losers in any tit-for-tat escalation of tariffs and other barriers.	人们常说，盈余国永远是以牙还牙的关税和其他壁垒大爆发的最大输家。
But this assumption misses multiple points.	但这一说法没有抓住很多要点。
For one thing, China is more economically resilient to the effects of a trade war than it used to be.	一方面，相较从前，如今中国对贸易战行为的经济承受力更强了。
Trade as a share of its total economic activity has halved in the past decade, from more than 60% of GDP in 2007 to just over 30% today.	贸易占总经济活动之比在过去十年中下降了一半，从2007年占GDP的60%以上下降到今天的略高于30 % 。
China also has major advantages in terms of domestic politics and international diplomacy.	中国在国内政治和国际外交方面也拥有重大优势。
As a dictatorship, China can ignore protests by workers and companies suffering from US tariffs.	作为独裁国家，中国可以无视因为美国的关税而受到影响的工人和公司的示威。
In the US, where mid-term congressional elections will be held this November, the outcry from exporters, importers, and consumers facing higher costs will be heard loud and clear.	在美国，中期国会选举11月就要拉开帷幕，面临更高成本的出口商、进口商和消费者的呼声表达的非常清楚。
Of course, Trump, too, might ignore protests against his trade war if he is convinced that taking on China will please his core voters and win him re-election in 2020.	当然，如果特朗普确信与中国较量能取悦他的核心选民，为他赢得2020年连任，那么他也有可能忽视反对他的贸易战政策的示威。
But congressional Republicans will probably feel differently, especially if their states or districts are among those being singled out by Chinese import tariffs.	但国会共和党感觉将有所不同，特别是如果他们的州或选区成为中国进口关税征收对象的话。
In terms of international diplomacy, Trump’s trade war will help China present itself as the defender of the rules-based international order and multilateral institutions such as the World Trade Organization.	用国际外交的话说，特朗普的贸易战有助于中国将自己包装为基于规则的国际秩序以及世贸组织等多边机构的捍卫者。
To be sure, not all countries would follow China’s lead.	当然，并不是所有国家都会跟随中国的领导。
The WTO does not recognize China as a market economy, owing to the Chinese government’s significant involvement in industry and alleged theft of intellectual property.	世贸组织不承认中国是市场经济，因为中国政府严重干涉产业，并被控窃取知识产权。
But China will have a chance to play the victim, while arguing that the US now poses the single largest threat to the global trading system that it helped create.	但中国将有机会扮演受害者角色，指责美国成为它所帮助建立的全球贸易体系的最大威胁。
And if a US-initiated trade war drags on, China’s case will become only stronger as more countries suffer the disruptive effects of tariffs.	而如果美国发动的贸易战延绵日久，中国的指控将随着越来越多的国家因为关税的破坏效应而变得更强。
Of course, China may choose not to fight Trump’s trade war at all.	当然，中国可能选择根本不与特朗普打贸易战。
With symbolic concessions – such as an agreement to import US-produced liquefied natural gas or promises to offer new guarantees for intellectual-property rights – it could convince Trump to stand down.	象征性的让步 — — 如同意进口美国产液化天然气或承诺新的知识产权权利保障 — — 就可能让特朗普满意收手。
But if Xi suspects that a show of strength will bolster China’s international standing while undercutting that of the US, he may decide to act accordingly.	但如果习近平认为示强能增强中国的国际地位，同时削弱美国的国际地位，他有可能做出这样的决定。
The North Korea issue is more complicated.	朝鲜问题更加复杂。
But here, too, China will have an advantage.	但在这个问题上，中国也有优势。
Even barring real progress in the talks, China already looks like a good global citizen.	即使阻挠了谈判的真正进展，中国看上去也像是国际好公民。
Over the past year, it has been pressuring the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, to negotiate.	去年它一直在施压朝鲜领导人金正恩参与谈判。
By participating in coordinated economic sanctions against the Kim regime, and by reportedly capping vital exports of oil and other essentials to the North, China has played its part in bringing Kim to the table.	加入针对金氏政权的合作共同经济制裁，以及（据称）切断对朝鲜至关重要的石油和其他必需品出口意味着中国在吸引金正恩回到谈判桌方面起着作用。
On paper, the fundamental question is whether North Korea will be willing to abandon its nuclear-weapons program, the fruit of more than 30 years of work.	表面上看，根本性问题是朝鲜是否愿意放弃其30多年来的工作成果 — — 核武器计划。
And as China well knows, North Korea would never give up its nuclear weapons without major changes in the military balance on and around the Korean Peninsula.	中国十分清楚，朝鲜绝对不会在朝鲜半岛周边军事平衡发生重大改变的情况下放弃核武器。
Kim will likely offer to denuclearize solely on the condition that the US withdraw its forces from South Korea, and perhaps from Japan, too. Barring that, he would not feel secure enough to do without the nuclear deterrence on which he has staked his regime’s survival.	金正恩可能提出，只要美国从韩国（也许还有日本）撤军就实施去核化。
For his part, Trump could not possibly accede to such a condition. At best, he could agree on a process through which such extraordinary moves might be discussed at a later date.	否则的话，他就无法在失去与其政权的生存系于一身的核威慑的情况下获得安全感。
Either way, China comes out on top.	无论如何，中国占尽主动。
In the event of stalemate, it will have gotten Kim to the table and put America in the position of being a refusenik.	如果出现僵局，它会让金正恩回到谈判桌，而让美国陷入被拒移民（refusenik）的地位。
And if the US does agree to any military concessions, China’s strategic position will be strengthened.	如果美国真的同意军事让步，中国的战略地位也会增强。
The only real question for Xi, then, is whether he wants to assert China’s top-dog status now, or sometime in the future.	因此，对习近平来说，唯一的真正的问题是他想现在就树立中国“带头大哥”的地位，还是等到未来某个时刻再树立。
	
China’s Dream World	中国的梦想世界
CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA – Ruling elites almost everywhere – whether in democracies or in authoritarian regimes – believe that clever sloganeering can inspire their people and legitimize their power.	发自加利福尼亚克莱尔蒙特 — — 几乎所有国家（不管是民主还是专制政体）的统治精英都认为漂亮的口号能鼓舞民众并使其权力合法化。
There are, of course, crucial differences.	当然，这其中有着关键性的差别。
In functioning democracies, government leaders can be held accountable for their promises: the press can scrutinize their policies, opposition parties are motivated to show that the party in power lies and cheats.	在实行民主制的国家，政府领导人要为其承诺负责：媒体可以仔细考究其政策，在野党会主动揭发执政党的谎言和骗局。
As a result, incumbents are frequently forced to carry out at least some of their promises.	因此，在位者常常会被迫兑现至少一部分承诺。
Autocratic rulers, by contrast, face no such pressures.	相比之下，独裁统治者就无需面对这样的压力。
Press censorship, repression of dissent, and the absence of organized opposition allow rulers the luxury of promising whatever they want, with no political consequences for failing to deliver.	新闻审查制度、对异见的镇压以及有组织反对派的缺失使得统治者可以任意夸下海口，却无须为诺言的无法兑现承担政治后果。
The result is government of the sloganeers, by the sloganeers, and for the sloganeers.	这就会导致政府由喊口号者组成，被喊口号者把持，并只为那些喊口号者服务。
China appears to have perfected this form of government over the last decade.	中国在过去十年间似乎已经完善了这种政府形式。
The ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP), in response to rising public demand for social justice, has devised numerous slogans, such as “governing for the people,” “building a harmonious society,” “balanced development,” “scientific development,” and so on.	执政的中国共产党为了回应公众对社会正义日益增长的需求，已经设计了众多口号，比如“执政为民 ” 、 “构建和谐社会 ” 、 “平衡发展”及“科学发展”等等。
Whenever the top leadership in Beijing uttered such slogans, they became the rallying cry of the bureaucracy.	不管北京的最高层领导何时提出这样的口号，它们都会成为官僚机构的战斗口号。
The party’s massive propaganda machine went into overdrive and blanketed the country with a publicity blitz that would make the most extravagant Madison Avenue advertising campaign look like child’s play.	中共的庞大宣传机器随之开始急速运转，用宣传闪电战地毯式轰炸整个国家，其情景简直让纽约麦迪逊大道上的广告宣传活动看起来像小孩玩的游戏。
But government by slogan, whether in China or in other autocracies, seldom achieves its declared goals.	但空喊口号的政府，无论是在中国还是在其它独裁国家，很少能达到其宣称的目标。
In the last decade, GDP growth soared, but most indices of social justice, governance performance, and public welfare deteriorated.	在过去的十年，中国GDP实现了高速增长，但社会正义、治理绩效和公共福利的大部分指标反而都恶化了。
Macroeconomic imbalances worsened as economic growth became excessively dependent on investment and exports.	随着经济增长变得过度依赖投资和出口，宏观经济失衡状况不断恶化。
Inequality worsened.	社会不平等状况也在加剧。
Official corruption escalated.	官员腐败升级。
Social mobility declined.	社会流动性下降。
Environmental degradation reached a crisis point.	环境恶化则到达了一个危机爆发点。
Today, it is the responsibility of China’s new leadership, headed by President Xi Jinping, to avert another decade of missed opportunities.	如今，避免接下来的十年继续错失时机的责任落在了以习近平主席为首的新一代领导层肩上。
Without missing a beat, Xi, like his predecessors, rolled out a new slogan to inspire popular confidence in his leadership.	紧随其前任的步调，新主席很快推出了一个新口号来激发公众对其领导能力的信心。
As a catchphrase for his administration’s objective, “the great renaissance of the Chinese nation” is bit long, but it has lately morphed into the simpler “China Dream.”	作为行政目标的宣传语 ， “ 中华民族的伟大复兴”有点长了，但它最近被改成了较为简单的“中国梦 ” 。
The substance of the China Dream remains difficult to determine.	但中国梦的实质内容仍然难以确定。
When Xi first unveiled his slogan after being selected as the CCP’s new general secretary, he defined it in simple, accessible, but nonetheless generic terms: The “Chinese people dream of living the same good life as all other people in the world.”	在习近平被选为新任中共总书记后首次公布其口号时，他用简单，容易理解，但依然笼统的术语来定义中国梦：即“中国人民过上和世界其他国家人民一样美好生活的梦想 。 ”
Xi has said little about the China Dream since – and his silence has caused considerable trouble.	自那以后习近平很少谈及中国梦 — — 而其沉默已经造成了相当大的麻烦。
China’s ever-zealous propaganda officials, evidently fearful of not demonstrating sufficient loyalty and respect for the new party chief, quickly hijacked the slogan; the China Dream has replaced the “China Model” in official political branding.	一向狂热的中国宣传部门官员显然害怕自己没有对新的党委总书记展示足够的忠诚和尊重，很快就劫持了这个口号；中国梦已经取代了官方政治宣传中的“中国模式”标牌。
Whatever the new administration does is touted as part of its ambitious effort to make the “China Dream” come true.	不管新政府干了些什么，都会被吹捧为是立志为让“中国梦”成真而努力。
Unfortunately, China propagandists, who double as censors, have a perverse ability to discredit anything that they try to brand.	不幸地是，中国的宣传者 — — 还同时兼任审查者 — — 拥有一种抹黑任何他们想要打造的招牌的怪异能力。
The China Dream is no exception.	如今的中国梦也不例外。
So far, public reaction has ranged from puzzlement to derision.	迄今为止，公众反应从迷惑转为了嘲笑。
After a decade of government by slogan, the Chinese public wants substance.	在经历了十年的口号统治之后，中国民众想要一些实质性的进展。
This presents Xi with a real challenge.	这给习主席提出了真正的挑战。
He has risen to the top by winning friends and allies inside the CCP.	他通过在共产党内部赢得朋友和盟友攀上了权力顶峰。
Now that he is the leader of a dynamic, diverse, and increasingly demanding society, he must gain popular support and confidence to maintain his credibility and become an effective politician.	如今他领导着一个动态、多元且要求越来越高的社会，他必须获得公众的支持和信心以维持其信誉并成为一个拿得出政绩的政治家。
The first thing that Xi should do is to articulate a clearer, more specific, and inspiring version of the China Dream, and stop letting the CCP’s propaganda officials define it for him.	习近平应该做的第一件事情是要明确给出一个更清晰、更具体且鼓舞人心的中国梦版本，并阻止中共宣传官员代他去下定义。
The China Dream may include all of the economic benefits and material comfort that ordinary Chinese desire, but it will not be complete without the human rights and dignity that citizens in civilized societies take for granted.	中国梦可以包含所有普通中国人想要的经济利益和物质需求，但如果缺乏文明社会公民视为理所当然的人权和尊严，中国梦就会是一个不完整的理念。
The second thing that Xi and his colleagues need to do is to follow up with specific policies and actions that can bolster the credibility of their declared goals.	习近平及其同僚应该做的第二件事则是跟进实施可以支撑其宣传目标可信度的具体政策和行动。
Political slogans, however high-sounding, become stale when their purveyors fail to make good on their promises.	政治口号 — — 无论多么高调，当许诺者不能兑现其承诺时都会变味。
Xi may still be enjoying a honeymoon with the Chinese public, but it is likely to be a short one.	习可能还正与中国的民众享受着他们之间的美好“蜜月 ” ， 但这个“蜜月”期会很短。
His predecessors had ten years to carry out real reforms and accomplished little, leaving the Chinese in no mood to endure another decade of government by shibboleth.	他的前任有十年的时间来实施真正的改革但只实现了很小一部分，这使得中国人失去了再次忍受十年空喊口号的信心。
	
Will China Weaponize Social Media?	中国会将社交媒体武器化吗？
ATLANTA – Ever since the 2016 US presidential election, with its revelations about Russian meddling, European officials have been on the lookout for similar attacks.	亚特兰大—2016年美国总统选举以来，随着俄罗斯干预大选行为的披露，欧洲官员也暴露在类似的攻击风险中。
But Europeans aren’t the only ones paying attention.	但欧洲人不是唯一保持关注的群体。
So, too, are China’s leaders, who are considering what they might learn from the Kremlin’s successes.	中国领导人也在保持关注，他们正在考虑或许可以从克里姆林宫的成功中汲取经验。
For Chinese President Xi Jinping, maintaining domestic stability is a top priority, a point underscored by China’s annual budget for internal security.	对中国国家主席习近平而言，保持国内稳定是第一要务，者从中国年度维稳预算中可见一斑。
At well over $100 billion, the official number is low.	官方数字是1,000亿美元以上，一点也不高。
Like defense outlays, the real number is much higher, owing to hidden spending, including on research and development.	和防务支出一样，拜包括研发在内的隐藏支出所赐，实际数字要高得多。
For example, China is exploring how artificial intelligence (AI) and big data can be used to monitor everything from social media to credit-card spending, and it plans to assign all citizens a social-reliability rating to weed out potential troublemakers.	比如，中国正在探索如何运用人工智能和的数据来监控从社交媒体到信用卡支付的一切，还计划给所有公民进行社会可靠性评级，以挖掘潜在的麻烦制造者。
The regime’s Orwellian strategy is focused squarely on social media and controlling not just what is said, but also how information flows into and around the country.	体制的奥威尔主义（Orwellian）战略的核心关注点是社交媒体，不但要控制说什么，还要控制信息如何在全国流动。
Moreover, the authorities are bringing technology companies into line with tough new laws and cyber-security investigations.	此外，当局要求科技公司遵守严苛的新法律和网络安全调查。
For Xi, the ease with which the Kremlin has manipulated Facebook and Twitter demonstrates the need for a tighter grip on China’s own social-media platforms.	对习近平来说，克里姆林宫能够轻易操纵脸谱和推特表明中国有必要抓紧控制自己的社交媒体平台。
The Chinese government is now requesting seats on the boards of companies such as WeChat, Weibo, and Tencent, and demanding access to their users’ personal data.	中国政府现在要求在微信、微博和腾讯等公司董事会安排董事，还要求接触用户个人数据。
Chinese cyber spies are also studying Russia’s success.	中国网络间谍也在研究俄罗斯的成功。
To be sure, Chinese hackers do not lack technical savvy.	平心而论，中国黑客并不缺乏技术。
They have launched cyberattacks against US presidential campaigns, expatriate Tibetan movements, and Uighur activists.	他们发动过针对美国总统选战、流亡西藏独立运动和维吾尔活跃分子的网络攻击。
They have burrowed into Western think tanks and universities that study China.	他们还潜入研究中国的西方智库和大学。
They have even hacked into Western news outlets that published embarrassing stories about Chinese leaders’ wealth.	他们甚至入侵了报道中国领导人财富丑闻的西方新闻机构。
Still, the Chinese may have something to learn from Russia’s well-choreographed online army of trolls and bots.	尽管如此，中国仍然可以从俄罗斯处心积虑构建的滚轮和机器人网络大军中汲取经验。
Similarly, strategists at the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) are likely poring over the Kremlin’s handiwork to inform their own cyber-war tactics.	类似地，解放军参谋们也可能正在仔细研究克里姆林宫的做法，来充实自己的网络战战术。
Chinese strategic thinking about “political warfare” holds that an adversary’s political, social, and economic institutions – particularly the media – should be targeted before a shooting war ever begins.	中国“政治战”的战略思维认为，敌方的政治、社会和经济机构 — — 特别是媒体 — — 应该在战争打响前先行打击。
To that end, Russia’s diffusion of bogus news and conspiracy theories through its state-funded media outlets RT and Sputnik could prove instructive.	在这方面，俄罗斯通过国家拨款的媒体机构RT和Sputnik来散播假新闻和阴谋论，对中国很有教育意义。
In addition to expanding China’s cyber capabilities, Xi has also been developing China’s soft power through economic, social, cultural, and media initiatives.	除了扩大中国的网络实力，习近平也在通过经济、社会、文化和媒体计划发展中国的软实力。
And although he has not yet coupled these programs with China’s clandestine forces to launch the kind of audacious attack that roiled the 2016 presidential election, he clearly is establishing the means to do so.	他尚未将这些计划与中国发动类似于颠覆2016年总统选举这样的大胆攻击的秘密力量组合起来，但他显然正在建立这样做的办法。
Recently, it was revealed that China has been conducting wide-ranging influence operations in Australia, using official campus organizations to monitor Chinese college students, business associations to tout Chinese interests, and diplomats to police local Chinese-language media.	据披露，最近中国一直在澳大利亚进行大范围影响力行动，用官方校园组织监控中国大学生、利用商会来推进中国利益，利用外交官来管理本地中文媒体。
Late last year, an Australian senator was forced to resign over his alleged ties to a Chinese billionaire.	去年年底，一位澳大利亚参议员因为与一位中国亿万富豪扯上了关系而被迫辞职。
China is also expanding its global media presence.	中国也在增加其在全球媒体中的露脸机会。
By some estimates, the government is sinking some $7 billion into new media and broadcast outlets abroad every year.	据一些估算，中国政府每年大约要花70亿美元用于新媒体和传播组织。
Its official news agency, Xinhua, has more than 170 bureaus around the world and publishes in eight languages.	其官方新闻机构新华社在全球有170多个分社，用八种语言发布消息。
China Central Television (CCTV) has more than 70 foreign bureaus and broadcasts to 171 countries in six languages.	中国中央电视台拥有70个海外记者站，用六种语言向171个国家播出节目。
China Radio International is the world’s second-largest radio broadcaster after the BBC, broadcasting in 64 languages from 32 foreign bureaus to 90 radio stations worldwide.	中国国际广播电台是仅次于BBC的世界第二大广播台，在从32家外国分台用64种语言向全世界播送广播。
None of these organizations has yet to distinguish itself as a go-to international news source.	所有这些组织都不认为自己是时兴的国际新闻源。
But they have become a significant source of information for people in underserved regions such as the Middle East and Africa, where they purvey China’s views and are building sympathetic audiences.	但它们已经成为中东和非洲等广播服务稀缺地区的人民的重要信息源，在这些地区传播中国的观点，建立有同理心的受众群。
At the same time, China is purchasing “native advertising” in Australian, American, and European newspapers.	与此同时，中国在澳大利亚、美国和欧洲报纸购买“本地广告 ” 。
This allows China to place officially authored content about controversial issues – such as its militarized island-building in the South China Sea – next to those publications’ editorial offerings.	如此，中国就能让官方授意的争议问题内容 — — 如在南海军事化的造岛行为 — — 和这些报纸的社论并列出现。
Xi is also playing the long game, by approving investments in movies and other forms of mass entertainment to influence how global popular culture treats all things Chinese.	习近平还在从长计议，批准投资电影和其他形式的大众娱乐来影响全球流行文化对待中国元素的方式。
Despite the Chinese government’s recent clampdown on outbound capital flows, Chinese companies are still adding to their major stakes in Hollywood properties.	尽管中国政府最近阻止资本外流，但中资公司仍在大举收购好莱坞企业的多数股份。
The Chinese conglomerate Dalien Wanda alone has some $10 billion in entertainment assets in the United States, Europe, and Australia.	光是万达集团就在美国、欧洲和澳大利亚拥有价值100亿美元的娱乐资产。
And other Chinese Internet and financial giants such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Hony Capital, as well as state-owned companies such as the China Film Group, have invested tens of billions of dollars in US film ventures.	其他中国互联网和金融巨头，如阿里巴巴、腾讯和弘毅资本，以及中国电影集团等国有企业，都耗资数百亿美元投资于美国电影产业。
With these financial stakes, the Chinese government has leverage that goes beyond old-fashioned censorship.	在投入了如此巨资后，中国政府就有了比老掉牙的审查更大的影响力。
Hollywood studio bosses with an eye on China’s massive domestic market will be tempted to kowtow to the government’s “creative” requests when it comes to scripts, casting decisions, and so forth.	好莱坞制作公司的老板们觊觎巨大的中国国内市场，将会为五斗米折腰，遵从中国政府在剧本、选角等方面的“创造性”要求。
At $8.6 billion in 2017, Chinese box-office receipts are second only to North America’s.	2017年，中国票房收入高达86亿美元，仅次于北美。
Yet China allows only 38 foreign films into the country each year, inducing filmmakers to bend over backward to please the censors.	但中国每年只允许引进38部外国影片，这让制片商竞相折腰取悦审查者。
Of course, Hollywood executives aren’t the only Westerners helping Xi’s realize his agenda.	当然，好莱坞高管们并不是帮助习近平实现自己的日程的唯一的西方人。
Between Apple’s recent decision to relinquish its Chinese user data storage to a Chinese partner and Google’s announcement that it will site a new AI research center in China, US technology giants are not just making deals to benefit their “stakeholders.”	最近苹果决定将中国用户数据储存转交给中国合作企业来进行，而谷歌也宣布将在中国建立一个新人工智能研究中心，这说明美国科技巨头不仅仅在设法让它们的“相关利益方”获益。
They are also handing Xi and his cyber operatives proprietary technologies and know-how, and even potential access to US targets.	它们还在向习近平和他的网络计划提供专利技术和知识，甚至直达美国目标的可能渠道。
This raises an obvious question: If Russia could roil a US presidential election without such intimate business relationships, what will China be able to do in the years ahead?	这引出了一个显而易见的问题：如果说俄罗斯在不具有如此紧密的商业关系就可以颠覆美国总统选举，那么中国在未来几年中能够做到什么？
To think that China’s only interest is making money, one Hollywood executive recently acknowledged, would be “very naive and dangerous” indeed.	一位好莱坞高管最近承认，认为中国唯一的兴趣是挣钱，这真的“非常幼稚和危险 。 ”
	
Xi Jinping’s Vision for Global Governance	习近平的全球治理视野
NEW YORK – The contrast between the disarray in the West, on open display at the NATO summit and at last month’s G7 meeting in Canada, and China’s mounting international self-confidence is growing clearer by the day.	发自纽约 — — 在北约峰会以及上月加拿大G7会议上公开展现出来的西方混乱状态，与中国日益增强的国际自信之间的对比日益明显。
Last month, the Communist Party of China (CPC) concluded its Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs, the second since Xi Jinping became China’s undisputed ruler in 2012.	上个月中共召开了中央外事工作会议，也是习近平自2012年坐稳最高领袖大位以来第二次召开此会议。
These meetings are not everyday affairs. They are the clearest expression of how the leadership sees China’s place in the world, but they tell the world much about China as well.	这些会议绝非日常事务，而是关于领导层如何看待中国全球地位的最清晰表达，同时也向世界传达了许多关于中国的信息。
The last such conference, in 2014, marked the funeral of Deng Xiaoping’s dictum of “hide your strength, bide your time, never take the lead,” and heralded a new era of international activism.	2014年召开的上一次会议标志着邓小平“韬光养晦，争取时间，永不称霸”指导方针的终结，并预示着一个中国开展国际行动的新时代。
In part, this change reflected Xi’s centralization of control, Chinese leaders’ conclusion that American power is in relative decline, and their view that China had become an indispensable global economic player.	在某种程度上这种变化反映了习近平已经完成集权，中国领导人认定美国实力已经相对衰落以及认为中国已成为不可或缺的全球经济参与者的观点。
Since 2014, China has expanded and consolidated its military position in the South China Sea.	自2014年以来中国不断扩大巩固其在南中国海的军事存在。
It took the idea of the New Silk Road and turned it into a multi-trillion-dollar trade, investment, infrastructure, and wider geopolitical/geo-economic initiative, engaging 73 different countries across much of Eurasia, Africa and beyond.	它开创了新丝绸之路的理念，并将其转变为数万亿美元的贸易、投资，基础设施和更广泛的地缘政治/经济倡议，涵盖欧亚大陆，非洲以及其他地区的73个不同国家。
And China signed up most of the developed world to the first large-scale non-Bretton Woods multilateral development bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.	同时中国与大多数发达国家签约建立了第一家大范围非布雷顿森林体系多边开发银行 — — 亚洲基础设施投资银行。
China has also launched diplomatic initiatives beyond its immediate sphere of strategic interest in East Asia, as well as actively participating in initiatives such as the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.	中国还在其邻近东亚的战略利益范围之外实施了一系列外交举措，并积极参与到了2015年伊朗核协定等外交倡议之中。
It has developed naval bases in Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Djibouti, and participates in naval exercises with Russia as far away as the Mediterranean and the Baltic.	它在斯里兰卡，巴基斯坦和吉布提开发了海军基地，并远赴地中海和波罗的海一线与俄罗斯共同进行海军演习。
In March, China established its own international development agency.	中国还在今年3月成立了自己的国际开发机构。
The emergence of a coherent grand strategy (regardless of whether the West chooses to recognize it as such) is not all that has changed since 2014.	一个连贯性大战略的浮现（无论西方是否选择承认这一点）还不是自2014年以来所发生变化的全部内容。
For starters, the emphasis on the CPC’s role is much stronger than before.	首先，对中国共产党所扮演角色的强调力度比以往大大加强。
Xi, concerned that the party had become marginal to the country’s major policy debates, has reasserted party control over state institutions and given precedence to political ideology over technocratic policymaking.	习近平忧虑中共会在该国重大政策辩论中遭到边缘化，因此重新巩固了党对国家机构的控制，并优先考虑政治意识形态而非技术官僚政策制定。
Xi is determined to defy the trend-line of Western history, to see off Francis Fukuyama’s “end of history” culminating in the general triumph of liberal democratic capitalism, and preserve a Leninist state for the long term.	习近平决心无视西方历史的发展主线，摒弃弗朗西斯·福山（Francis Fukuyama）认定自由民主资本主义获得普遍胜利的“历史的终结”观点，并在长时期内维系一个列宁主义国家。
This approach – known as “Xi Jinping Thought” – now suffuses China’s foreign policy framework.	这个被称之为“习近平思想”的路径如今已经彻底充斥着整个中国外交政策框架。
In particular, Xi’s view that that there are identifiable immutable “laws” of historical development, both prescriptive and predictive, was particularly prominent at last month’s foreign policy conference.	特别是习近平关于在历史发展方面存在可以辨认且永恒不变的“法则 ” — —而且既可指定又可预测 — — 的观点在上月的外事会议上显得尤为突出。
If this sounds like old-fashioned dialectical materialism, that’s because it is.	这听起来像是老一套的辩证唯物主义论调，而且事实也确实如此。
Xi embraces the Marxist-Leninist tradition as his preferred intellectual framework.	习近平选取马克思列宁主义传统作为自己首选的知识框架。
Given its emphasis on iron laws of political and economic development, a dialectical-materialist worldview means that there is nothing random about world events.	在这一政治和经济发展铁律之下，辩证唯物主义的世界观意味着世界上的各类事件不存在任何随机性。
So, Xi argues, if Marx’s analytical framework is applied to the current period, it is clear that the global order is at a turning point, with the West’s relative decline coinciding with the fortuitous national and international circumstances enabling China’s rise.	因此，习近平认为，如果马克思的分析框架适用于当前时期，那么全球秩序显然处于一个转折点，西方的相对衰落再加上有利的国家和国际环境造就了中国的崛起。
In Xi’s words, “China has been in the best period of development since modern times, while the world is undergoing the most profound and unprecedented changes in a century.”	用习近平的话说 ： “ 当前我国处于近代以来最好的发展时期，世界处于百年未有之大变局 。 ”
Of course, formidable obstacles lie ahead for China. But Xi has concluded that the obstacles facing the US and the West are greater.	当然中国的前进道路上依然存在着巨大的障碍，但习近平得出的结论是美国和西方面临的障碍要更大。
How such thinking will now drive China’s concrete foreign policy is anyone’s guess.	这种想法如今将如何推动中国的具体外交政策还是个未知之数。
But how one-party states, particularly Marxist states, choose to “ideate” reality matters a great deal: it is how the system speaks to itself.	但至关重要的则是一党制国家 — — 尤其是马克思主义国家 — — 在对现实进行“理想化”的过程中如何抉择：这关乎整个系统是如何跟自身对话的。
And Xi’s message to China’s foreign policy elite is one of great confidence.	而习近平对中国外交政策精英传达的则是极大的信心。
Specifically, the Central Conference called for the country’s international policy institutions and personnel to embrace Xi’s agenda.	具体而言，本次外事工作会议要求本国的国际政策机构及人员响应习近平的议程。
Here Xi seems to have the foreign ministry in his sights.	在此习近平似乎有意针对外交部。
There is a strong ideological flavor to Xi’s apparent frustration with the ministry’s glacial approach to policy innovation.	习近平对该部门在政策创新方面的动作迟缓深感不满，并因此传达出一种强烈的意识形态气息。
China’s diplomats were urged to bear in mind that they are first and foremost “party cadres,” suggesting that Xi is likely to push the foreign policy apparatus toward greater activism, to give full effect to his emerging global vision.	会议要求中国外交官牢记自己首先是“党的干部 ” ， 暗示习近平可能会推动外交政策机器更大程度地发挥主动性，以充分服务于他本人新构筑的全球视野。
The biggest change to emerge from last month’s conference concerns global governance.	上个月会议产生的最大变化则是在全球治理方面。
In 2014, Xi referred to an impending struggle for the future structure of the international order.	在2014年，习近平提到了即将到来的事关未来国际秩序结构的斗争。
While he did not elaborate, much work has since been devoted to three inter-related concepts: guoji zhixu (the international order); guoji xitong (the international system), and quanqiu zhili (global governance).	虽然他未能继续详细说明，但自那以后，许多工作都致力于三个相互关联的概念：国际秩序；国际体系；全球治理。
Of course, these terms have different and overlapping meanings in English, too.	当然，这些术语在英语中拥有相互不同又有所重叠的含义。
But, broadly speaking, in Chinese, the term “international order” refers to a combination of the United Nations, the Bretton Woods Institutions, the G20, and other multilateral institutions (which China accepts), as well as the US system of global alliances (which China does not).	但广义上来说，在中文中“国际秩序”一词意指（中国所接受的）联合国，布雷顿森林体系机构，G20集团和其他多边机构以及（中国所不接受的）美国全球联盟体系的组合。
The term “international system” tends to refer to the first half of this international order: the complex web of multilateral institutions that operate under international treaty law and seek to govern the global commons on the basis of the principle of shared sovereignty.	“国际体系”一词多指这一国际秩序的前半部分：由根据国际条约法规运作并寻求在共享主权原则的基础上管理全球公共领域的各个多边机构所组成的复杂网络。
And “global governance” denotes the actual performance of the “international system” so defined.	“全球治理”表示以此定义的“国际体系”的实际表现。
What is startlingly new about Xi’s remarks at the Central Conference was his call for China now to “lead the reform of the global governance system with the concepts of fairness and justice.”	习近平在外事工作会议上最令人吃惊的新言论则是要求中国“以公平正义为理念引领全球治理体系改革 。 ”
This is by far the most direct statement of China’s intentions on this important question offered so far.	这是迄今为止中国在这一重要问题上对自身意图的最直接表述。
The world should buckle up and get ready for a new wave of Chinese international policy activism.	为此全世界都应该坐稳扶好，迎接中国国际政策主动出击的新浪潮。
Like much of the rest of the international community, China is acutely conscious of the dysfunctionality of much of the current multilateral system.	与国际社会其他大多数国家一样，中国非常清楚当前大部分多边体系的失能状况。
So Xi’s wish to lead “reform of the global governance system” is no accident.	所以习近平领导“全球治理体制改革”的愿望绝非偶然。
It reflects growing diplomatic activism in multilateral institutions, in order to reorient them in a direction more compatible with what China regards as its “core national interests.”	它反映了中国将更多地针对多边机构进行外交主动出击，以便将它们重新定位到与中国自身“国家核心利益”更加一致的方向上。
Xi has reminded China’s international policy elite that the totality of China’s future foreign policy direction, including the reform of global governance, must be driven by these core national interests.	习近平提醒本国的国际政策精英说，中国未来的外交政策方向，包括全球治理改革，必须由这些国家核心利益所驱动。
In this context, China also wants a more “multipolar” international system.	在这一背景下中国也想要一个更“多极”的国际体系。
This is code for a world in which the role of the United States and the West is substantially reduced.	它指向的是一个美国和西方权重大幅减少的世界。
The challenge for the rest of the international community is to define what type of global order we now want.	而国际社会其他成员所面临的挑战则是确定我们现在想要哪种类型的全球秩序。
What do existing institutions like the European Union, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or the African Union want for the international rules-based system for the future?	欧盟，东南亚国家联盟或非洲联盟等现有机构对未来的国际规则体系有何寄望？
What exactly does the US want, with or without Trump?	无论特朗普是否上台，美国到底想要什么？
And how will we collectively preserve the global values embodied in the UN Charter, the Bretton Woods institutions, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights?	我们将如何集体保护《联合国宪章 》 ， 布雷顿森林体系机构以及《世界人权宣言》所体现的全球价值观？
The future of the global order is in a state of flux.	全球秩序的未来处于不稳定状态。
China has a clear script for the future.	而中国构思出了一个清晰的未来蓝图。
It’s time for the rest of the international community to develop one of its own.	同时也是时候让国际社会的其他成员发展出属于自己的那一套了。
This is an edited version of an address delivered to the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore.	本文是根据作者在新加坡国立大学李光耀公共政策学院所发表的演讲整理而成。
	
Xi of Arabia	阿拉伯的习主席
BEIJING – Those who have criticized China’s cautious foreign policy need to reconsider their position, following President Xi Jinping’s just-completed visit to Saudi Arabia and Iran – two major Middle Eastern powers that are currently at each other’s throats.	北京—那些批评中国外交政策谨小慎微的人需要重新考虑立场了。 中国国家主席习近平刚刚结束了对沙特阿拉伯和伊朗的访问。
The visits reflect the more active foreign-policy approach that Xi has spearheaded, particularly in the Middle East.	这两个国家都是中东主要力量，目前处于严重对峙状态。 此次出访体现了习近平所主导的更加积极的外交政策方针，特别是在中东。
This new approach raises an important question: Can China’s impact on the region be more constructive than that of the United States?	这一新方针引出了一个重要问题：中国在该地区的影响力是否比美国更具建设性？
Now is certainly a tense time to become involved in the Middle East, a region where, as Richard N. Haass argues, a New Thirty Years’ War, in which “civil wars and proxy wars become impossible to distinguish,” is unfolding.	如今显然是介入中东的敏感时刻，理查德·哈斯（Richard N. Haass）认为，该地区正在展开一场新三十年战争 ， “ 内战和代理战争已无法区分 ” 。
A key factor in unleashing the current chaos – which represents the convergence of numerous deep-rooted challenges and conflicts – was America’s 2003 invasion of Iraq.	导致当前乱象 — — 其根源是众多深层次挑战和冲突汇聚在一起 — — 的一大关键因素是2003年美国入侵伊拉克。
By eliminating Saddam Hussein’s Sunni regime, the US paved the way for a Shia-led government, a development that tilted the regional balance of power toward Iran and left Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia feeling encircled by a Shia coalition.	美国推翻了萨达姆·侯赛因的逊尼派政权，为什叶派领导的政府扫清了道路，这一变化让地区平衡向伊朗倾斜，也让逊尼派统治的沙特阿拉伯感到被什叶派联盟所包围。
That is why Iran and Saudi Arabia are so deeply involved in Syria’s civil war.	因此，伊朗和沙特阿拉伯都深深介入了叙利亚内战。
They know that the fate of President Bashar al-Assad’s Alawite regime will have significant implications for the regional order.	它们知道，叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德的阿拉维派政权的命运对于地区秩序具有重大影响。
For Saudi Arabia, reining in Iran is all the more important in the wake of the recent agreement on the country’s nuclear program, which has resulted in the lifting of international economic sanctions that have long constrained Iran’s regional leadership ambitions.	对沙特阿拉伯来说，在最近伊核问题达成协议（长期限制伊朗作为地区领导者雄心的国际经济制裁将因此取消）的情况下，制约伊朗是其第一要务。
Of course, neither Saudi Arabia nor Iran – or Turkey, which has also joined the competition for regional influence – is seeking a direct confrontation.	当然，沙特阿拉伯和伊朗 — — 还有土耳其，它刚刚加入到争夺地区影响力的竞争中 — — 都不想要直接冲突。
These countries would rather empower other actors, even if it means fueling dangerous religious radicalization and the privatization of violence.	这些国家宁可扶持其他行动方，即使这意味着会增强危险的宗教激进化和暴力私有化。
The terrorist movements that have emerged as a result of this approach – namely, the Islamic State – cannot be defeated using traditional counter-terrorism operations.	因地区国家的这一方略而崛起的恐怖主义运动（即伊斯兰国）是无法用传统反恐行动打败的。
To be sure, these Middle East rivals are not the only ones involved in the region’s current quagmire.	平心而论，这些中东对峙各方并不是该地区当前乱局的唯一当事方。
External powers like France, Russia, and, of course, the US are also deeply involved, each with its own geopolitical objectives.	外部力量，如法国、俄罗斯，当然还有美国，也深深地介入其中，每一方都有其自身的地缘政治目标。
Now China is entering the fray, bringing a uniquely constructive vision with it.	现在中国也在加入其中，带来了独一无二的建设性政策。
The two characters that comprise the Chinese word for crisis (危机) mean, individually, “danger” (危) and “opportunity” (机).	中文词语“危机”包含着“危”和“机”两个汉字。
That is precisely what China sees in today’s Middle East.	这正是当前中国对中东的看法。
For most of the relevant actors, highly perilous geopolitical competition is overshadowing vast economic opportunities.	对最相关的行动方而言，高度危险的地缘政治竞争使巨大的经济机会黯然失色。
Not for China.	对中国来说并非如此。
As Xi put it on his recent visit to Cairo: “Instead of looking for a proxy in the Middle East, we promote peace talks; instead of seeking any sphere of influence, we call on all parties to join the circle of friends for the Belt and Road initiative.”	习近平最近在访问开罗时指出 ， “ 我们在中东不找代理人，而是劝和促谈；不搞势力范围，而是推动大家一起加入‘一带一路’朋友圈 。 ”
This reflects the broader foreign-policy rebalancing that Xi has been pursuing since taking office in 2013.	这反映出习近平自2013年执政以来一直在推动的更大层面上的外交政策再平衡。
Unlike the US, which has been engineering a strategic “pivot” from one geographic region to another, China is rebalancing from “politics among nations” to “politics among networks,” focusing on “connectivity” rather than “control.”	与一直在将战略“支点”从一个地区转向另一个地区的美国不同，中国正在实施从“国家间政治”向“网络间政治”的再平衡，着重于“连通”而非“控制 ” 。
The Middle East is crucial to this connectivity-oriented grand strategy, not least because of its key role in the “One Belt, One Road” project that Xi promoted in Cairo.	对于这种以连通为导向的大战略来说，中东地区至关重要，它是习近平此行在开罗所宣扬的“一带一路”计划的关键。
China’s determination to reestablish the ancient Silk Roads – including the overland route that runs through the Middle East – has led it to enter into strategic partnerships with eight Arab countries in recent years, and to sign agreements with six Arab countries to pursue the initiative jointly.	中国决心重建古丝绸之路 — — 包括横穿中东的陆上丝绸之路 — — 因此近几年来中国与八个阿拉伯国家建立了战略伙伴关系，并与六个阿拉伯国家签署协议共同推进“一带一路 ” 。
Iran, Turkey, and seven Arab countries are among the founding members of the Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a key institution for financing related infrastructure projects.	伊朗、土耳其和七个阿拉伯国家是亚洲基础设施投资银行的创始成员国，该银行总部设在北京，它是相关基础设施项目的关键融资机构。
But China is not waiting for the One Belt, One Road initiative to be completed before pursuing increased trade with Middle Eastern countries.	但中国并没有等到“一带一路”计划完成后再去增加与中东国家的贸易。
During his recent visit to Saudi Arabia, he claimed that free-trade negotiations between the Gulf Cooperation Council and China should be concluded this year.	在最近访问沙特阿拉伯期间，习近平宣布，海湾合作委员会与中国的自由贸易谈判要在今年完成。
Moreover, Xi announced that China will issue $55 billion in loans to the Middle East, including a $15 billion special loan for industrialization, $10 billion in commercial loans to boost production capacity, and $10 billion in concessional loans.	此外，习近平还宣布中国将向中东提供550亿美元贷款，包括150亿美元工业化特别贷款、100亿美元用于增进产能的商业贷款和100亿美元优惠贷款。
The remaining $20 billion will go toward a joint investment fund with the United Arab Emirates and Qatar to invest in traditional energy, infrastructure development, and high-end manufacturing industries in the region.	其他200亿美元将以与阿联酋和卡塔尔组成联合投资基金的形式，投资于该地区的传统能源、基础设施开发和高端制造业。
All of this aligns with the “1+2+3” cooperation pattern that Xi proposed at the June 2014 Ministerial Conference of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum in Beijing.	所有这些都与习近平在2014年6月的中阿国家合作论坛部长级会议上所提出的“1+2+3”合作模式相符。
According to this approach, energy cooperation should form the core of collaboration, while infrastructure construction and trade and investment form two wings. Nuclear power, satellites, and new energy sources are three high-tech areas where cooperation can lead to important breakthroughs.	根据这一方针，能源合作将成为一个核心，而基础设施建设与贸易投资组成两翼，核能、卫星和新能源是合作中可能形成重大突破的三大高科技领域。
Here, the goal is to take advantage of the region’s energy resources, while helping it to industrialize and diversify its economy.	这一合作模式的目标是利用好中东国家的能源资源，同时帮助它们实现工业化和经济多元化。
Of course, China’s success in the Middle East requires progress on mitigating the region’s tensions, cooling its hotspots, and stabilizing weak countries – all of which will require smart diplomacy by many actors.	当然，中国在中东的成功需要在减少该地区紧张局势、给热点降温、稳定较弱国家等方面取得进展 — — 所有这些都需要众多行动方的明智外交政策。
But peace and development are inextricably linked.	但和平与发展是密不可分的。
To turn the tide against extremism, Middle Eastern countries must be able to provide economic opportunities to their people, and these can only be secured through trade, investment, and jobs.	要想扭转极端主义趋势，中东国家必须能够为民众提供经济机会，而经济机会只能通过贸易、投资和就业来实现。
In this fundamental respect, China has a lot to offer the Middle East – and President Xi has once again shown his determination to offer it.	在这一关键方面，中国能够给中东提供很多帮助 — — 而习近平主席也再次表达了提供帮助的决心。
	
China’s Contradictions	中国的各类矛盾
NEW HAVEN – China’s quinquennial Communist Party congresses are that rare event where ritual and dogma combine with introspection and strategy. The 19th National Congress, which began on October 18, is no exception.	发自纽黑文 — — 五年一度的中共全国代表大会是一场罕见地将仪式、教条和内省、战略相结合的事件，而10月18日召开的十九大也不例外。
Notwithstanding the suspense over potential changes in Party leadership, which typically occur at the end of the meeting, President Xi Jinping’s political report, delivered on the opening day, was a high-impact event.	尽管悬念总是被放在会议末段的中共高层领导班子调整上，但习近平总书记在开幕当天的政治报告也是一个具备高度影响力的事件。
Significantly, it says as much about the Party as it does about Xi.	值得注意的是，报告用了跟谈论习近平一样的篇幅来谈论党。
As Alice Miller, a leading Sinologist at Stanford’s Hoover Institution, emphasizes, the report was carefully crafted over a one-year period to convey the consensus of the Party’s highest organ, the 205-member Central Committee.	正如斯坦福大学胡佛研究所的知名中国研究家爱丽丝·米勒（Alice Miller）所强调的那样，这份精心攥写了一年的报告就是用来传达由205人组成的中共中央委员会（也是中共最高领导机关）的共识。
Three conclusions from Xi’s address are particularly important.	习近平的三个结论尤为重要。
For starters, the ideological underpinnings of “Xi Jinping Thought” have been raised to the same lofty level as those of “Mao Zedong Thought,” effectively elevating Xi over his three predecessors – Hu Jintao, Jiang Zemin, and even the revered Deng Xiaoping.	首先 ， “ 习近平思想”已经被提升到与“毛泽东思想”相同的崇高水平，实际上超越了他的三位前任：胡锦涛，江泽民，甚至是威望极高的邓小平。
Much has been written about Xi’s consolidation of power since he was appointed General Secretary in November 2012. But this elevation makes it official.	我们已经看过有很多关于习近平自从2012年11月被任命为党总书记以来如何巩固权力的文章报道，但这一提升使其被正式确定下来。
After only five years in office, the Party leadership has anointed Xi as one of modern China’s two greatest historic figures.	仅仅在位五年时间，党的领导层就已经将习近平拔高成了现代中国的两大历史人物之一。
Second, the political report speaks with great confidence about a China that has now entered a “New Era.” But by underscoring the Chinese adage that the “…last leg of a journey just marks the halfway point,” Xi sketched an even more ambitious future.	第二，这份政治报告以充满信心的语气谈论了现在进入“新时代”的中国，但通过强调“行百里者半九十”这句格言，习近平描绘了一个更加雄心勃勃的未来。
China’s sights are now set on two goals – completing the task of building the so-called moderately prosperous society by 2035, and then establishing its position as a Great Power by 2050.	中国的目光现在放在两个目标上 — — 到2035年完成建设所谓小康社会的任务（报告原文为“在全面建成小康社会的基础上，再奋斗十五年，基本实现社会主义现代化 ” ） ，然后在2050年前建成一个强国。
Unlike China’s goal-setting exercises in the past, there are no quantitative targets attached to these “twin centenary goals” (which roughly align with the Party’s founding in 1921 and the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949). They celebrate the long-awaited national rejuvenation that Xi has dubbed the China Dream.	跟中国过去的目标制定做法不同，这两个“百年奋斗目标 ” （ 与1921年中共建党和1949年中华人民共和国成立时间大致配对）并没有提出任何量化指标，只是颂扬了期待已久的民族复兴（习近平称之为“中国梦 ” ） 。
The third point is perhaps the most intriguing.	第三点可能是最有趣的。
This is couched in the form of China’s “principal contradiction” – a Marxist concept that serves as an admission of a fundamental problem requiring resolution.	这体现在关于中国“主要矛盾”形式的措辞上 — — 这是一个用以提出亟待解决之根本问题的马克思主义概念。
The principal contradiction, while typically elliptical and ambiguous, frames a rich discussion of risks and opportunities, strategy and tactics, reforms and governance – all of which will shape China’s prospects for the foreseeable future.	这一主要矛盾的表述虽然通常是隐晦且模凌两可的，但却会构成对关于风险/机遇、战略/手段和改革/治理的丰富讨论，所有这些都将在可预见的未来塑造中国的前景。
The big news is that, under Xi’s leadership, the Party has revised its principal contradiction for the first time since 1981. Whereas the contradiction had previously been framed as a tradeoff between the needs of the people and China’s “backward social production,” it is now viewed as a tension between “unbalanced and inadequate development” and the “people’s ever-growing needs for a better life.”	最重要的是，在习近平的领导下中共自1981年以来首次修改了对主要矛盾的描述，该矛盾从前被认为是人民日益增长的物质文化需求和“落后生产力”之间的折衷，如今被修改为“不平衡不充分的发展”和“人民日益增长的美好生活需要”之间的紧张关系。
This restatement of the principal contradiction has not emerged from thin air.	这个主要矛盾的重述并不是空穴来风。
It clearly signals a far-reaching change in national perspective – from that of a poor developing country to that of an increasingly prosperous society focused on becoming a Great Power.	其清楚地展现了关于中国国家视野的一个重大变化 — — 从贫穷的发展中国家再到一个旨在成为强国的逐渐富裕社会。
It is also consistent with the critique of former Premier Wen Jiabao, who in March 2007 famously warned of a Chinese economy that was becoming increasingly “unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated, and [ultimately] unsustainable.”	这也跟前总理温家宝的评论是一致的，他在2007年3月曾经警告说，中国经济越来越“不稳定，不平衡，不协调，并（最终）不可持续 ” 。
Over the past ten years, two five-year plans – the 12th, enacted in 2011, and the 13th, enacted in 2016 – plus a major set of reforms adopted at the so-called Third Plenum in 2013, have aimed to resolve China’s persistent and worrisome imbalances.	在过去十年来出台的两个五年计划（2011年颁布的十二五和2016年颁布的十三五 ） ， 加上2013年召开的十八届三中全会所通过的一系列改革，都旨在解决中国持续存在且令人忧虑的失衡问题。
Xi’s political report doesn’t alter the main thrust of those efforts.	习近平的政治报告并未改变这一系列努力的主旨。
The real significance is that rebalancing is now enshrined within the Party’s ideological underpinnings. It is a foundational pillar of Xi Jinping Thought.	真正重大的意义在于再平衡现在已经被纳入了党的思想基础之内，也是习近平思想的基础支柱。
The political report’s focus on China’s principal contradiction also raises important questions about what still may be missing from the Party’s long-term strategy.	政治报告对中国主要矛盾的关注也引发了关与党的长期战略中仍然缺失哪些内容的重大问题。
Three “secondary contradictions” are especially striking on the economic front.	而对此三个“次要矛盾”在经济方面尤为突出。
First, there is ongoing tension between the role of the state and that of markets in guiding resource allocation.	首先，国家与市场在指导资源配置方面所扮演的角色依然存在冲突。
This was a glaring contradiction of the 2013 Third Plenum reforms, which focused on the seemingly inconsistent combination of a “decisive role” for markets and steadfast support for state ownership.	在2013年十八届三中全会改革中曾提到过一个明显矛盾，重点在于市场的“决定性作用”和对国家所有权的坚定支持这两者看似不协调的组合。
The Party has long believed that these two features of economic life are compatible – the so-called blended economy with Chinese characteristics.	长期以来，党始终认为经济生活的这两大特征是可以兼容的 — — 也就是所谓中国特色的混合所有制经济。
Xi’s political report praises the mixed ownership model and also aspires to an economy led by great firms with unmatched global competitive prowess. But it glosses over the thorny issue of state-owned enterprise reform that may be required to resolve this contradiction and avoid the Japanese “zombie” problem of a chronic debt overhang.	习近平的政治报告赞扬了这一混合所有制模式，也渴望建立一个以具备压倒性全球竞争实力的伟大企业为主导的经济，但报告掩盖了解决这一矛盾以及避免日本式“僵尸企业”长期欠债问题所需的棘手国企改革。
Second, there is the tension between supply and demand.	二是供需矛盾紧张。
Consistent with other recent pronouncements of senior Chinese officials, the political report leaves little doubt that supply-side structural reforms are now the highest priority of economic policymakers.	与最近中国高层官员的其他声明一致，政治报告认为供应方面的结构改革无疑是经济决策者当前的首要任务。
The related emphasis on productivity, innovation, pruning excess capacity, and moving up the value chain in manufacturing and services are underscored as key building blocks of this effort.	对提高生产率，创新，削减过剩产能以及向制造业和服务价值链上游迈进的相关强调也是这一努力的重要组成部分。
At the same time, the report de-emphasizes consumer spending and services – now buried deep in the list of priorities for a modernized economy.	与此同时，该报告放弃了对消费者支出和服务的强调 — — 这项事务如今已经在建设现代化经济的优先事项中排名末尾了。
Yet focusing on supply without paying equal attention to the foundations of aggregate demand is a puzzling and potentially worrisome disconnect.	然而，关注供应却不重视那些构建总需求的基础是一个令人困惑且有可能在将来引发担忧的缺失。
A final secondary tension can be found in the contrast between the path and the destination.	最后一个次要矛盾可以在路径和目的地之间的对比中找到。
Notwithstanding all the self-congratulatory flourishes in Xi’s political report, there is good reason to believe that the Chinese economy is only in the early stages of its long-heralded structural transformation.	尽管习近平的政治报告充斥着自我表扬，但有理由相信中国经济依然处于其长期鼓吹的结构转型的早期阶段。
Its services sector is growing rapidly, but is still embryonic, accounting for just 52% of GDP.	其服务业正在快速增长，但仍处于初创阶段，仅占GDP的52 ％ 。
And household consumption, which is also growing rapidly, is still less than 40% of GDP.	家庭消费虽然也在快速增长，也还不不足GDP的40 ％ 。
China may well be on a path to a New Normal or a New Era.	中国或许已经走上了一个迈向新常态或新时代的道路。
But the final destination remains far down the road, with many contradictions to be resolved during the journey.	但最终目的地依然遥远，旅途中也会有许多矛盾需要解决。
	
When Xi Meets Obama	当习近平遇见奥巴马
CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA – As Chinese President Xi Jinping begins his trip to the United States in Seattle, home to many of the world’s leading technology firms, most observers are looking ahead to his subsequent meeting with President Barack Obama.	克莱蒙特，加利福尼亚—中国国家主席习近平在西雅图开始了访美之旅。 西雅图是许多世界领先的科技公司的总部所在地。
Can the summit reverse the downward spiral in US-China relations that began with Xi’s accession to power in 2013?	许多观察者正在期待他随后与美国总统奥巴马的会面。 两人的峰会是否能够扭转2013年习近平上台以来中美关系恶化的趋势？
Few dispute that the world’s most important bilateral relationship is in deep trouble.	毫无疑问，全世界最重要的双边关系陷入了深深的麻烦。
From the US perspective, China’s reckless behavior in the South China Sea, unrestrained cyber attacks against American targets, protectionist economic policies, and escalating political repression at home have demolished the belief that a globally integrated China would be a responsible and cooperative partner.	从美国的角度，中国在南海的“任性”行为、无节制的针对美国目标的网络攻击、保护主义经济政策和逐步升级的对内政治压迫使其无法再相信融入全球的中国将是负责任的合作伙伴。
Indeed, recent Chinese actions directly challenge vital American interests and core values.	事实上，最近中国的行为直接挑战了美国的核心利益和核心价值。
Chinese leaders, for their part, view America’s strategic “pivot to Asia” as a thinly veiled step to tighten its geopolitical containment of China.	而中国领导人将美国战略性“重返亚洲”视为欲盖弥彰的加紧对华地缘政治遏制的措施。
Moreover, they have become obsessed with US dominance in international finance and technology and, most important, America’s ideological commitment to liberal democracy, which they regard as an existential threat to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).	此外，他们着迷于美国在国际金融和科技方面的主宰地位以及，更重要的，美国坚定的自由民主意识形态（他们视为中共的生存威胁 ） 。
The toxic mix of mutual mistrust and tit-for-tat behavior has brought Sino-American ties to their lowest point since the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989.	互不信任和针锋相对行为构成了一个危害重重的组合，让中美关系跌至1989年天安门事件以来的最低点。
There is now widespread concern that the US and China may be headed for a new cold war.	如今，人们广泛担忧美国和中国可能开始新的冷战。
For Xi, the stakes of his US trip could not be higher.	对习近平来说，此次访美可谓意义重大。
To maintain his domestic image as a strong leader, he must stick to his nationalist rhetoric and policies.	要想维持其强势领导人的国内形象，他必须坚持其民族主义口风和政策。
But he also needs to stabilize the all-important relationship with the US.	但他也需要稳定最重要的对美关系。
Judging by recent moves by China and the US, we can expect modest success in a few contentious areas.	从中国和美国最近的动作判断，我们可以期待双方在一些有争议的领域取得些许成功。
While such improvements, on their own, will not change the relationship’s adversarial dynamic, they may halt the deterioration in bilateral ties, at least for now.	这些改善本身不会改变中美关系的对抗动态，但也许能够阻止双边关系的恶化，至少在当前是如此。
On the eve of the summit, both the US and China took positive, albeit symbolic, steps to demonstrate their goodwill and improve the diplomatic atmosphere.	在峰会即将到来之际，美国和中国领导人都采取了积极（尽管是象征性）的举措证明各自的良好意愿、改善外交氛围。
The US extradited a low-level Chinese official to face corruption charges.	美国遣返了一名面临腐败指控的低级中国官员。
The Obama administration also decided not to announce sanctions against Chinese entities and individuals allegedly involved in cyber attacks on American companies and government agencies.	奥巴马政府还决定不对被控参与对美国公司和政府机构发动网络袭击的中国单位和个人进行制裁。
For its part, China released a human-rights activist and dispatched a high-level delegation to the US to discuss cyber security.	中国则释放了一位人权活动家，并派了一个高规格代表团来到美国讨论网络安全问题。
In fact, the two sides are reportedly negotiating a landmark deal that would prohibit cyber attacks against each other’s vital infrastructure.	事实上，双方据称正在谈判一项里程碑式的协议，禁止互相网络攻击关键基础设施。
An agreement on the issue could be the most important outcome of the summit, although other types of cyber attacks are unlikely to be covered by it.	在这一问题上形成协议可能是峰会最重要的成果，尽管该协议不可能覆盖其他类型的网络袭击。
For China, the biggest prize is a bilateral investment treaty (BIT).	对中国来说，最大的好处是双边投资条约。
In practical terms, a US-China BIT would make it easier for Chinese entities to invest and operate in the US and increase American firms’ access to Chinese markets.	从务实角度，中美双边投资条约将让中国单位更加方便地赴美投资和经营，也能促进美国企业进入中国市场。
Such a deal would be a near-term boon for Xi, because it would represent a vote of confidence by the US in China’s struggling economy.	对习近平来说，这一协议是一个短期福音，因为这代表美国对陷入困境的中国经济充满信心。
But the prospects for a BIT are uncertain, at best.	但双边投资条约的前景并不确定。
The US Congress is deeply skeptical, and the American business community needs convincing as well.	美国国会深刻地怀疑中国，而美国企业界也需要确信。
Both have been bitterly disappointed by China’s mercantilist trading policies after its accession to the World Trade Organization.	国会和企业界都因为中国加入世贸组织后采取的重商主义贸易政策而大失所望。
Given how many contentious issues remain unresolved, an accord is unlikely during the summit.	考虑到众多争议问题尚未解决，峰会期间不太可能形成协议。
The South China Sea dispute may prove to be the toughest diplomatic nut to crack.	南海纠纷也许是最棘手的外交问题。
China has staked its national prestige and its leadership’s nationalist credentials on this issue, which means that Xi is likely to rebuff US demands that China cease all activities seen as militarizing its new artificial islands in disputed waters.	中国在这一问题上押上了国家尊严和领导人的民族主义情操，这意味着习近平可能会断然拒绝美国要求中国停止所有被视为对其在争议海域的新造人工岛进行军事化改造的行为。
The most that can be realistically expected is an insipid statement of the two sides’ agreement to disagree.	从现实角度，我们最多能够期待双方发表一些无关痛痒的承认分歧的声明。
But the most politically sensitive topic for China has little to do with cyber security or the South China Sea. It is China’s ongoing crackdown on civil liberties and human rights.	但对中国来说，政治上最敏感的话题既非网络安全，亦非南海，而是中国一直在镇压公民自由和人权的问题。
Facing enormous domestic pressure, Obama has announced that human rights will be on the agenda of his summit with Xi.	面临巨大国内压力的奥巴马已经宣布人权将是其与习近平峰会的议程之一。
But Xi is unlikely to make any concessions, because doing so could damage his political standing within the CCP and undermine a central component of his political vision: the reassertion of political control over a dynamic society.	但习近平不可能做出任何让步，因为这样做将危害到他在中共党内的政治立场，也有害于其政治愿景的一个关键要素：重新获得对充满活力的社会的政治控制。
Ultimately, the key question looming over the summit is whether Xi will be able to offer enough to repair the damage done to Sino-US relations in recent years.	最终，峰会的关键问题是习近平是否拿出足够的诚意修复近几年来中美关系所遭到的破坏。
To be sure, trying is better than doing nothing.	诚然，做点尝试比什么都不做要好。
But what really matters is whether, after the summit, China takes concrete actions that reflect a genuine shift from the policies that have fueled the deterioration in bilateral ties.	但真正重要的是峰会之后中国是否拿出实际行动证明其真正开始远离那些加剧双边关系恶化的政策。
	
The Sino-American Employment Challenge	中美合作应对新经济时代就业挑战
HONG KONG – Donald Trump’s rise to power in the United States involved more than a little China-bashing.	香港—特朗普为了当选美国总统，采取了不少抨击中国的策略。
Yet, with Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to Trump’s Florida estate earlier this month, it seems that the status quo in the bilateral relationship – crucial for global trade, growth, and stability – will be maintained.	但本月初中国国家主席习近平与特朗普在其佛罗里达庄园的会晤显然具有稳定中美关系现状的作用。
That could be very good news for Chinese and US workers alike.	中美关系对于全球贸易、增长和稳定有着至关重要的意义，这次会晤对于中国和美国的工人来说都是非常好的消息。
At the summit, Xi reiterated China’s commitment to maintaining a positive relationship with the US.	在峰会上，习近平重申了中国保持对美良好关系的承诺。
“We have a thousand reasons to get China-US relations right,” he said, “and not one reason to spoil” them.	“我们有一千条理由把中美关系搞好 ， ” 他说 ， “ 没有一条理由把中美关系搞坏 。 ”
Trump, for his part, accepted Xi’s invitation to visit China soon.	特朗普则接受了习近平的邀请，将于近期访华。
On trade, Trump and Xi agreed to a 100-day plan for discussions on reducing the US trade deficit with China.	在贸易方面，特朗普和习近平同意启动一个百日计划，讨论如何减少美国对华贸易赤字。
Moreover, the US accepted China’s proposal to revamp the framework for bilateral engagement by creating the US-China Comprehensive Dialogue, consisting of four sub-dialogues: diplomacy and security, economic issues, law enforcement and cybersecurity, and social and cultural affairs.	此外，美国也接受了中国关于通过建立中美全面对话来改善双边关系的一个框架性的建议，对话包括四个方面：外交与安全、经济问题、执法与网络安全，以及社会和文化事务。
The understanding between Xi and Trump reflected a sober acknowledgement of the domestic and international risks their countries face.	习近平与特朗普之间的相当积极的互相理解反映出他们对各自国家所面临的国内和国际风险有着清醒的认识。
Both seemed to recognize that a stable US-China relationship is necessary to enable them to focus on their respective challenges.	两人都认识到，稳定的中美关系是他们能够专注于各自挑战的必要条件。
For Xi, those challenges include supply-side structural reforms to address corruption, pollution, rising debt, overcapacity, and low productivity.	对习近平来说，这些挑战包括供给侧结构改革以解决腐败、污染、债务增加、产能过剩和生产率低下问题。
As for Trump, the main imperative is to overcome political and institutional obstacles to fulfilling his promises, including to reduce taxes and invest in infrastructure.	对特朗普来说，当务之急是克服政治和制度障碍，实现包括减税和基础设施投资在内的竞选承诺。
But there is one key challenge that both leaders have in common: jobs.	但两国都面临一个共同的关键挑战：创造就业。
Technological advances, especially in automation and robotics, are putting a growing number of jobs under pressure.	科技进步，特别是自动化和机器人，让越来越多的工作岗位处于压力之中。
In the US, that pressure was a driving force behind Trump’s election (though it was often and disproportionately blamed on immigrants and developing-country exporters, including China).	在美国，这一压力是特朗普当选的推动力之一（尽管人们常常错误地将就业问题归咎于移民和包括中国在内的发展中国家的出口 ） 。
But in China, too, technology-driven job insecurity could pose a threat to political stability.	而在中国，科技导致的就业问题同样也可能给政治稳定造成威胁。
According to a report released by US President Barack Obama’s administration last year, anywhere from 9% to 47% of jobs will be threatened by automation during the coming decade.	据去年美国总统奥巴马政府发布的报告，未来十年将有9 % — 47%的就业岗位受到自动化的威胁。
More recently, McKinsey released its own report on the topic, in which it estimates that about 60% of all occupations could undergo automation of 30% or more of their constituent activities.	最近，麦肯锡也发布了有关这个问题的报告，其中估算，大约60%的岗位中可能发生30%或以上的工作将被自动化机器代替。
Now, world leaders – beginning with Trump and Xi – must figure out how to sustain employment, as existing jobs disappear.	如今，任何世界领导人 — — 从特朗普和习近平开始 — — 必须找到办法在现有工作岗位不断消失的情况下维持就业。
The Obama administration’s study recommended a three-pronged approach: investment in artificial intelligence (to take advantage of its benefits); education and training of workers for the jobs of the future; and aid for workers in transition.	奥巴马政府的研究报告建议采取三管齐下的方针：投资人工智能（以利用其收益 ） ； 为工人提供未来就业岗位所需要的教育和培训；以及在转型过程中为工人提供补助。
This is all well and good, but one imperative is missing: ensuring that enough new jobs actually are created.	这一方针虽好，但忽略了一个当务之急：确保实际上能够创造足够多的新岗位。 没有新岗位，培训得再好的工人还是没有工作。
In both the China and the US, job disruptions are subject to sectoral and geographic imbalances.	在中国和美国，就业岗位危机都受到产业和地区结构失衡的影响。
Driverless cars, for example, will threaten some 2-3 million jobs in the US.	比如，无人驾驶汽车将在美国威胁到200—300万个工作岗位。
Those job losses will hit workers in some sectors – beginning with personal and freight transport – particularly hard.	这些岗位损失对于某些产业 — — 如客运和货运交通 — — 的冲击将特别严重。
Similarly, the effects of automation on factory workers tend to be concentrated in particular regions.	类似地，自动化对工厂工人的影响主要集中在特定的地区。
America’s Rust Belt, which once boasted a powerful manufacturing sector, is already suffering the consequences of automation.	美国的锈带，即昔日引以为豪的强大的制造业基地，已经在承受自动化所带来的后果。
In China, it is the northeastern region that is being hit hardest by job losses, owing to overcapacity and the closure of polluting and loss-making heavy industries.	在中国，由于产能过剩和重污染、高亏损的重工业企业的倒闭，受就业岗位损失冲击最大的是东北地区。
But the most consequential asymmetry affecting the job-creation challenge may be the one between institutions and policies.	但影响就业创造最严重的障碍也许是用人机构与就业政策之间的不协调。
Sharp increases in government employment are usually fiscally unsustainable and even counterproductive, as they can crowd out the private sector.	政府就业的急剧增加常常令财政不堪重负，甚至产生适得其反的效果，因为这可能挤出民营部门的扩张。
Yet large enterprises – whether private or state-owned – are in job-reduction mode, driven either by profit or efficiency pressures.	而大企业 — — 不论是民营还是国有 — — 都处于裁员的压力中，或者是因为利润萎缩，或者是为了减员增效。
This leaves small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) to pick up the slack.	这意味着中小企业必须填补未来就业的空白。
China’s SMEs are certainly capable of doing so.	中国中小企业显然有能力完成这一任务。
Indeed, even if large enterprises were not currently shedding workers, they would be at a disadvantage vis-à-vis more efficient and innovative SMEs in an economy transformed by interactive Internet platforms.	事实上，即使大企业目前没有裁员，它们面对一个被互动性互联网平台所改变的新经济中的高效创新的中小企业也不存在优势。
Consider e-commerce.	以电子商务为例。
As a recent report by the Alibaba Research Institute points out, e-commerce is transforming the relationship between customers and businesses.	阿里巴巴研究所的最新报告指出，电子商务正在改变客户与企业之间的关系。
What was once a business-to-consumer supply-and-distribution model has become far more interactive, with customers constantly delivering feedback to which businesses must constantly adapt.	曾经的企业-消费者供销模式互动性大大增强，客户可以随时提供反馈，而企业必须随时根据反馈做出调整。
Large Internet platforms like Alibaba can use Big Data and smart analytics to monitor such changes.	阿里巴巴等大型互联网平台可以利用大数据和智能分析监控这些变化。
But large established firms cannot respond to those changes – say, by adjusting what they are producing or how they are distributing it – with the same speed and flexibility as their SME counterparts.	但老牌大企业则无法以中小企业同行一样的速度和弹性应对这些变化 — — 它们往往很难调整其固有的产品生产及分销渠道。
Despite the potential of SMEs to produce valuable innovation and create jobs, however, the sector has been woefully neglected by policymakers.	尽管中小企业在创造有价值的创新和就业岗位方面潜力巨大，可惜它们往往被决策者忽视了。
For example, tax incentives do not account for SMEs’ positive externalities in terms of job creation and innovation.	比如，税收激励往往没有考虑中小企业在就业创造和创新方面的正外部性。
And, because of the risks of individual failures, SMEs often face higher costs for bank credit, particularly in China.	此外，由于担心企业风险和破产，中国的中小企业常常面临更高的银行信用成本。
As the world’s two largest consumer markets and leading trade partners, China and the US can do much to help each other overcome the barriers to increased, broad-based, and high-quality job creation.	作为全世界最大的两个消费市场和主要贸易伙伴，中国和美国在互相帮助，克服障碍，增加广泛的高质量就业岗位方面大有可为。
The US has the technology, talent, and regulatory experience to continue to lead the way on innovation, supporting job creation in new and future-oriented industries and activities.	美国拥有领先的技术、人才和监管经验，可以继续引领创新、支持在未来导向的行业和项目中创造工作岗位。
And China’s move toward a consumption-led economy, driven by an increasingly modern services sector, is likely to boost demand for high-quality and innovative US goods and services.	而中国向消费拉动及现代化服务业驱动型经济的转型可以刺激对高质量的创新性美国商品与服务的需求。
The result would be a much more balanced trade relationship and, potentially, a new global partnership for development.	中美合作的结果将是更加平衡的贸易关系，并有望形成新的全球发展合作伙伴关系。
With that in mind, one can only hope that Trump maintains the cooperative spirit demonstrated at the recent Florida summit.	但愿特朗普能将他在最近的佛罗里达峰会上所表现出来的合作精神保持下去。
	
Why Work at Work?	为什么要上班工作？
PHUKET – Marissa Mayer, the new CEO of Yahoo!, recently created a fuss by issuing an edict that forbids anyone at the company to work from home.	普吉岛—最近，雅虎新CEO玛丽莎·梅耶（Marissa Mayer）发布公告禁止雅虎员工在家办公，此禁令掀起了一阵波澜。
Mayer’s demarche received a lot of press coverage, probably more than it deserved.	梅耶的这一新政吸引了大量媒体注意，以致有大惊小怪之嫌。
That may not be so surprising: she is a woman, and she allegedly has a nursery for her baby next door to her office.	这或许并不那么令人惊奇：她是女人，而且据说她办公室隔壁就有托儿所可以照顾她的孩子。
Above all, people seemed to react to the categorical nature of her decision (why everyone?) and to the irony that Yahoo! is a tech company (don’t they know about Skype?).	毕竟，激起人们反弹的是她的决定的绝对性（为何所有人都得如此？ ）以及雅虎是个技术公司所带来的讽刺意味（他们不知道Skype是怎么做的吗？
	）
I think that Mayer made the right decision, and I am sure that over time exceptions to her order will be allowed at managers’ discretion.	我认为梅耶的决定是正确的，我可以肯定，假以时日，经理就有批准其指令的例外情况的自由裁量权。
But, until now, the “right” to work at home was sacrosanct at Yahoo!, something that an employee’s manager could not overrule.	但是，到目前为止，在家工作的“权利”在雅虎仍是神圣不可侵犯的，是经理不可否决的雇员特权。
And, by all accounts, enough people at Yahoo! were not working, either from home or from more interesting places, that it had become a serious problem.	但是，据大家所说，雅虎有很多人根本不工作，不管是在家还是在更有意思的地方，这已经成了一个严重的问题。
Beyond that, Mayer’s edict makes more sense as a means of cultural change within a business than it does as a way to improve any particular individual’s productivity.	除此之外，梅耶的禁令与其说是改善特定员工的生产率的方法，不如说是改变企业文化的手段。
Almost precisely because working remotely is easy, the advantage that a workplace has over a collection of home workers – or a set of outsourced workers assembled through Task Rabbit – is that people can accomplish more in a setting that provides a common culture and the benefit of serendipitous connections.	远程办公很容易，正是因为如此，有工作场所比起集体在家办公 — — 或通过任务兔子（Task Rabbit）组织一组外包员工 — — 的优势在于在提供共同文化的地方一起办公能完成的工作更多，更能激发意外默契。
Long ago, the advantage of a firm was that it lowered transaction costs (an idea first clearly expressed by the Nobel laureate economist Ronald Coase), such as the costs of finding workers, assigning them to tasks, assessing productivity, and setting salaries.	很久以前，企业的优势在于它能降低交易成本（第一个清晰阐述这一思想的是诺贝尔经济学奖获得者罗纳德·科斯 ） ， 即招聘员工、指派任务给员工、评估生产率、设定薪水等活动的成本。
Now that transaction costs are so low, the primary benefit of working at work is that the physical interactions foster an organizational culture and boost creativity, rather than efficiency or productivity, within an established routine.	如今，交易成本已经极低，上班工作的主要好处在于固定模式中的身体互动能激发组织文化和提升创造力，而不在于效率和生产率。
Mayer, I think, did not order her employees back to the office merely because some people were not actually working at home; rather, many of those who were working were not working together.	我认为，梅耶要其员工回到办公室的原因绝不仅仅是某些员工在家并不工作，而是许多工作的员工没有在一起工作。
To be sure, it seems contradictory to some people that Yahoo!, an online business, requires its employees to be physically present in the company’s offices.	诚然，对一些人来说，雅虎作为一个在线企业，要求其员工天天出现在办公室中有些奇怪。
But most of the money and talent in this industry already seem to concentrate physically in one small part of the United States, between San Francisco and San Jose.	但该行业的资金和人才都集中在美国从旧金山到圣何塞的一小块区域中。
Whether it’s the Yahoo! Cafeteria (now more inviting and more frequented with the advent of free food), or the halls of the Plug & Play startup accelerator, proximity matters.	不管是雅虎的自助餐厅（随着免费食物的出现变得更有吸引力也更繁忙）还是Plug & Play创业孵化大楼，面对面（proximity）至关重要。
Being physically present at work means direct contact with other sharp and creative minds.	上班出现在工作场所意味着与其他犀利而富于创造力的头脑的直接交流。
And the benefits of human contact and interaction are why salespeople still call on customers instead of using Skype, and why Meetup (which supports organizers of face-to-face meetings; I am on the company’s board) changes lives in ways that Twitter and Facebook rarely do.	人际交流和互动的好处正是销售员仍在拜访客户，而不是使用Skype的原因，也是Meetup（支持组织者的面对面会议；我是该公司董事）能以Twitter和Facebook所不能的方式改变生活的原因。
Of course, those who prefer to work at home cite not just the cost and time of commuting, but also the proliferation of meetings – too much culture, perhaps – and a steady flood of communication that simply interrupts their work rather than enhancing it.	当然，喜欢在家工作者的论据不仅包括沟通需要成本和时间，也包括会议滋生 — — 也许是太“多”的文化 — — 和稳定的过度沟通只能干扰其工作，而起不到促进作用。
Interestingly, I heard this point at a WPP Stream “unconference” in Phuket, Thailand, where a couple of hundred people had flown thousands of miles to meet face to face to share ideas and strengthen working relationships.	有趣的是，我在泰国普吉岛WPP Stream“非会议 ” （ unconference）上听说了这一点，在那里，好几百人从千里之外飞来面对面分享关于强化工作关系的心得。
So, yes, online work can make a lot of sense in many situations, but when you are trying to fix a broken corporate culture, you need the commitment, human engagement, and creative interaction that happen most consistently in a physical workplace.	因此，在线工作确实在多种情形中作用多多，但当你试图修复破坏的公司文化时，你需要承诺、人力参与和创造性互动，而这只能在实体工作场所中才能坚持进行。
In the end, it is up to good managers to decide who can work where, and to make meetings short and useful.	最后，优秀的经理会决定谁能在何处工作，并让会议变得简短有效。
Indeed, the whole point of having managers is that they are supposed to exercise judgment.	事实上，之所以要有经理，全部原因在于他们能够执行裁决。
Otherwise, computers and the Internet would allow us not just to work from home, but to report to a software program rather than to a person.	否则的话，计算机和互联网不但可以让我们在家办公，还能让我们向软件程序而不是活人报告。
But, in the end, the challenge is to find the right fit between people and environment.	但是，最终，挑战在于找到人与环境的正确契合点。
Personally, I come at this from the opposite direction.	就个人而言，我是个反面范例。
As an independent angel investor with no real day job, I don’t have an office to report to every day.	作为非真正全日制工作者的独立天使投资人，我没有办公室，也不需每日报告。
But I would miss the companionship of people working around me – even if they do not necessarily work with me.	但我会失去与周围人一起工作带来的交谊机会 — — 即便他们未必是我的同事。
Fortunately, Meetup allows me to sit at a desk amid its roughly 90 people; I travel a lot, but I work from a desk at Meetup whenever I am at “home” in New York City.	幸运的是，Meetup让我能够与大约90人共济一堂；我做了长途旅行，但我在纽约市的“家”中可以随时随地出现在Meetup会议桌上。
True, I don’t have to go to the company’s meetings, but I like being surrounded by busy people; I know it makes me work harder.	诚然，我不必非得出席公司会议，但我喜欢周围都是忙人的感觉；我知道，这让我工作更加努力。
Whatever our work, we remain physically social beings.	不管我们做什么工作，我们始终是社会生物。
	
Yankee Bases Go Home	美军基地滚回去
RIO DE JANEIRO – Last month, the leaders of all 12 countries of South America (except one) gathered in Quito, Ecuador’s capital, for the summit of the Union of South American Nations.	里约热内卢 - - 上个月，南美全部十二个国家的领导人（除了一位）会聚厄瓜多尔首都基多举行“南美国家联盟 ” （ UNASUR）峰会。
UNASUR or UNASUL (depending on whether one speaks Spanish or Portuguese) was established by the twelve presidents in Brasília in May 2008 with the aim of furthering economic and political integration.	UNASUR 或 UNASUL（缩写视西班牙语或葡萄牙语而定）是（南美）十二国总统于2008年五月在巴西利亚建立的，其宗旨是促进经济和政治一体化。
Instead, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez hijacked the Quito meeting to propagate his Bolivarian Revolution and expound his own ideas for the continent’s future as independent of the United States.	然而，委内瑞拉总统查韦斯却劫持了基多会议来宣扬其玻利维尔革命，并详细解释了他自己关于该大陆独立于美国的未来的理念。
Thanks to America’s recently announced military agreement with Colombia, Chávez’s ideas got more of a hearing than might have been expected. For, instead of infrastructure plans, commercial or environmental treaties, or even multilateral action against such common problems as violence and poverty, the issue that dominated both press accounts and the speeches at the gathering was the new US-Colombian military agreement, announced less than a month before the summit.	由于美国最近宣布与哥伦比亚达成军事协定，查韦斯的声音得到了比预想更多的关注：因为媒体报道和峰会演讲中的主导性话题不是基础设施规划，商业或环境条约，甚至也不是应对暴力和贫困等共同问题的多边行动，而是在峰会前不到一个月时宣布的美国 - - 哥伦比亚新军事协定。
To no one’s surprise, Chávez dominated the criticism of the pact.	查韦斯毫无意外地发出了批评该协定的最强音。
He claimed that the “Winds of war are blowing,” and that the announcement of the military agreement “can transform itself into a tragedy.”	他宣称“战争的风正在吹起 ” ， 军事协定的宣布“可能转化成一场悲剧 。 ”
Unfortunately, Colombian President Álvaro Uribe was absent from the meeting.	不幸的是，哥伦比亚总统Álvaro Uribe没有出席会议。
Colombia and Ecuador broke diplomatic relations in March 2008, after Colombia’s army pursued FARC guerillas, who have been fighting Colombia’s government for decades, into Ecuadorean territory.	在哥伦比亚军队追击FARC 游击队进入厄瓜多尔领土之后，两国于2008年三月断绝了外交关系。 该游击队已经与哥伦比亚政府对抗了数十年。
So Uribe could not defend the new military agreement.	因此Uribe未能就新军事协议进行辩护。
This left the floor open to Chávez to isolate Colombia and preach against the US.	这就给了查韦斯机会孤立哥伦比亚并高唱反美论调。
In a continent where anti-Americanism remains both very popular and an effective way to consolidate national cohesion and political power, Chávez’s attacks found a ready audience.	在这片反美情绪依然广泛，并能被用来有效地强化民族凝聚力和政治权力的大陆，查韦斯的攻击言论大有市场。
In addition, Uribe’s absence allowed Chávez to avoid responding to Colombia’s accusations that Venezuela and its ally Ecuador support the narco-Marxist FARC.	另外，Uribe的缺席使得查韦斯避免了回应哥伦比亚关于委内瑞拉和其盟国厄瓜多尔支持毒品马克思主义的FARC的指控。
One week after the summit, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tried to calm the continent’s fears about the US-Colombia agreement, explaining that it is merely a minor revision of the Bill Clinton-era Plan Colombia, an American program to support the government against the drug cartels.	在峰会后一周，美国国务卿希拉里·克林顿试图缓和南美诸国对美国 - - 哥伦比亚军事协议的恐惧。 她解释说这只不过是对克林顿时期《哥伦比亚计划》的微调而已。
But her words did little soothing.	美国的该项计划是为了支持哥政府对抗毒品卡特尔。 但她的解释没有令人放心。
Nor did it seem to help that even most local military analysts say that the agreement does not represent any major change in the US military position on the continent.	即使大多数当地的军事分析家都认为该协议并不代表美国在该大陆军事立场的重大改变，但也于事无补。
The simple fact is that the timing of the announcement of the pact was terrible, and gave a platform for Bolivarian rants that will not be without consequences.	事实非常简单，该协议宣布的时机太糟糕了。 它给了玻利瓦尔式“后果很严重” 的咆哮一个机会。
Indeed, the ongoing fallout is likely to remain very negative.	的确，这场未平的余波所带来的影响仍将是非常负面的。
By raising anti-American suspicions and strengthening Chávez’s position across the continent, the agreement weakens the influence of Brazil.	由于激起了反美的怀疑情绪并强化了查韦斯在南美大陆的地位，该协议削弱了巴西的影响力。
Recently, Brazil had been differentiating itself from the rest of the continent through its stable economy and vibrant democratic political system, both of which were helping the country’s poor.	最近，巴西因为稳定的经济和富有活力的政治体系而在南美独树一帜，而这两项都有利于该国的穷人。
So the spread and strengthening of Chávez’s so-called Bolivarian Revolution was not in Brazil’s interests, even though some of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s officials appear to be fans of Chávez and his administration.	所以，查韦斯所谓“玻利瓦尔革命”的推广和强化不符合巴西的利益。 尽管卢拉总统麾下的某些官员似乎是查韦斯及其政府的崇拜者。
The terrible timing of the US-Colombia military agreement also gave Chávez and his allies a reason to build up their armies against the “evil imperialist ianque .”	美国 - - 哥伦比亚军事协议的糟糕时机还为查韦斯及其盟友壮大军力对抗“邪恶的帝国主义美国佬” 提供了理由。
After all, one must remember, the Bolivarian Revolution’s supposed “enemy�� is the US, and no one else.	毕竟，我们必须记住，玻利瓦尔革命的“假想敌”不是别人，正是美国。
So the agreement may legitimize and produce an arms race in South America, which is in no one’s interest.	因此这项协议可能在南美引发一场合法的军备竞赛，而这对于任何国家都是无益的。
Another unexpected consequence of the US-Colombia military agreement may be a further heightening of tensions between Venezuela and Colombia.	美国 - - 哥伦比亚军事协议的另一个意想不到的后果可能是进一步加剧委内瑞拉和哥伦比亚之间的紧张关系。
The radical polarization of the Andean region between those two countries will create difficulties in building regional consensus and security problems in the Amazon, as well as weakening the Brazilian project for South American political and economic integration.	两国之间的安第斯地区的激烈两极分化会给达成区域性共识和阿马逊地区的安全问题造成困难，同时还会削弱巴西在南美政治经济一体化中的努力。
Finally, another major consequence of the US-Colombia deal are the doubts that it has created in Latin America about President Barack Obama’s administration, and about the future of relations between the US and South America, especially Brazil, the main regional power.	最后，美国-哥伦比亚协定的另一个重大后果就是在拉美制造了对奥巴马政府和对美国和南美，特别是和地区大国巴西之间未来关系的怀疑。
The agreement revived the perception that US diplomacy lacks sensitivity where the region is concerned.	该协议又印证了一种看法，即美国外交缺乏对该地区的敏感性。
If Obama wants to encourage moderate and democratic politics in South America, and to bolster Brazil’s efforts to foster stability and economic progress against the region’s radical and undemocratic forces, it must take greater care in not appearing to undermine those the US claims to support.	如果奥巴马想要鼓励在南美实行温和与民主的政治，并支持巴西对抗该地区的激进和非民主力量，以实现稳定和经济进步的努力，他就必须倍加小心不要给人口蜜腹剑的印象。
For Chávez is showing that the old cry of “Yankee go home” still resonates.	因为查韦斯正让人意识到“美国佬滚回去”的经典呼号仍然回响在耳边。
	
The Periphery’s Purgatory	外围国的炼狱
ATHENS – German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s upcoming visit to Athens will be a far less tense affair than her earlier journeys here during Europe’s long financial crisis.	雅典—德国总理默克尔即将访问雅典，此次访问所引起的紧张远远比不上她在欧洲长期金融危机期间来访时。
Of course, Greeks have little love for Merkel; but, thanks to Europe’s modest economic recovery, some of the poison has been drawn from Germany’s relations with Europe’s most damaged and distressed economies.	当然，希腊人并不喜欢默克尔；但是，感谢欧洲经济的缓慢复苏，德国与欧洲受伤最深经济体之间的关系也有所缓和。
Indeed, Europe is no longer considered a risk to global financial stability.	事实上，欧洲已不再被视为全球金融稳定的风险因素。
The eurozone’s core economies are showing signs of revival, and financial conditions in the over-indebted periphery are improving as well.	欧元区核心经济体正在显示出恢复迹象，过度负债的外围的金融状况也在改善。
But, given capital shortages, depressed demand, and the slow pace of reform in the eurozone periphery, continued progress is far from certain.	但是，由于存在资本短缺、需求受抑以及欧元区外围改革进展缓慢，进展能否保持还远未可知。
In the eurozone economies that were hit hardest by the global economic crisis, the output and employment losses have been huge and persistent.	在受全球经济危机冲击最大的欧元区经济体，产出和就业损失巨大而持久。
Real (inflation-adjusted) per capita income in the eurozone as a whole hovers around its 2007 level; in Greece and Italy, however, it has sunk to the levels recorded in 2000 and 1997, respectively.	欧元区整体实际（经通胀调整的）人均收入在2007年水平徘徊；希腊和意大利分别下降到2000年和1997年水平。
Meanwhile, the eurozone’s overall unemployment rate is 12%, and it is much higher in the periphery.	与此同时，欧元区整体失业率高达12 % ， 外围更是远远高于这个数字。
In Spain, more than 25% of the labor force is jobless, while Italy’s youth unemployment rate stands at 42%.	在西班牙，超过25%的劳动力没有工作，意大利的年轻人失业率高达42 % 。
In Greece, where the overall unemployment rate has climbed to 28%, some 60% of the country’s young people are unemployed.	在希腊，总体失业率升高至28 % ， 更有60%左右的年轻人没有工作。
Recovering from such crippling employment losses will not be easy, and will require a speedy return to high and sustainable growth rates.	从如此惨重的就业损失中恢复决非易事，并且需要快速恢复可持续的高增长率。
Consider Greece, where the government is planning a return to the capital markets in the coming months to finance the country’s long-term borrowing needs, even though securing such financing would require paying unsustainably high interest rates.	以希腊为例，希腊政府计划在未来几个月回到资本市场为其长期借款需要融资，尽管确保融资需要付出不可持续的高利率。
The fact that the government seems willing to do so translates clearly its desire to move beyond the influence of the “troika” (the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission, and the European Central Bank).	希腊政府决心这样做这一事实清楚地表明他渴望摆脱“三驾马车（国际货币基金组织、欧盟委员会和欧洲央行）的影响。
Indeed, since 2008, Greece’s GDP has shrunk by almost 25%.	事实上，自2008年以来，希腊GDP收缩了近25 % 。
Recovering lost capacity will require large amounts of capital, but there are five reasons why such financing is unlikely, under present conditions, to be forthcoming:	恢复失去的产能需要大量资本，但出于五个理由，希腊无法在当前条件下迅速获得融资：
· As a result of austerity, public investment as a share of GDP continues to fall and has now reached a record low.	· 拜紧缩所赐，公共投资占GDP之比一直在下降，现已降至创纪录的低位。
Having already committed substantial rescue funds, eurozone authorities do not seem inclined to inject fresh capital.	已经承诺给出大量援助资金的欧元区当局似乎不再愿意注入新资本。
· Sources of domestic private capital are limited, because the recession and the related near-collapse of asset prices, along with a sharp increase in taxation – particularly on high incomes and on capital – significantly weakened balance sheets.	· 国内私人资本十分有限，因为衰退和近乎崩溃的资产价格加上税收的急剧增加 — — 特别是对高收入和资本的税收 — — 极大地破坏了资产负债表。
· Bank lending has slowed drastically, as a result of Greek banks effectively defaulting in the wake of the troika-imposed losses on sovereign creditors and the nationalization of the country’s banks.	· 银行贷款急剧放慢，因为希腊银行已经事实违约，而违约原因是三驾马车给主权债权人强加的损失以及希腊银行的国有化。
A record-low level of deposits and the recession-related rise of non-performing loans have weakened Greek banks’ capital position further.	创纪录的低存款和拜衰退所赐的不良贷款增加进一步削弱了希腊银行的资本充足度。
(Today, companies in the eurozone periphery borrow at substantially higher rates than their counterparts in the core.	（如今，欧元区外围国政府的借款利率显著高于核心国。
For bank loans, the ratio is almost two to one; for long-term financing, it may reach as high as ten to one.)	对银行贷款来说，比例为2比1；对长期融资来说，比例可能高达10比1 ） 。
· Greece’s unsustainable debt position is discouraging foreign private investment.	· 希腊不可持续的债务状况让外国私人投资打起了退堂鼓。
The assumptions about primary surpluses, private-sector involvement, and GDP growth underlying the government’s commitment to reduce its debt level, which currently exceeds 170% of GDP, to 124% of GDP by 2020 cannot be realized, given Germany’s opposition to restructuring the official financing that replaced the defaulted private loans.	初级盈余、私人部门参与、以及政府降低债务水平承诺所需要的GDP增长水平（目前的债务水平位GDP的170%多，到2020年应降低至124 % ） 等方面的目标不可能实现，因为德国反对重组取代违约私人贷款的官方融资。
Some easing of loan conditionality – via extended maturities and reduced interest rates ‒ will be agreed later this year, but it will not be enough to calm fears of a new default.	今年晚些时候将达成一致放松一些贷款条件（通过延长期限和降低利率 ） ， 但不足以平息对新一轮违约的担心。
· Trust between foreign and Greek investors is lacking, and it will not be restored until debt sustainability is achieved.	· 希腊和外国投资者之间缺乏信任，并且在实现债务可持续之前，信任无法重塑。
But Germany and the other core eurozone countries consistently block any proposal that contemplates debt mutualization or fiscal union.	但德国和其他欧元区核心国家一致地阻挠任何考虑债务共同化��财政联盟的方案。
Ideas such as Eurobonds, a single European finance ministry, and increased capitalization of Europe’s common rescue funds (the European Stability Mechanism and the Single Resolution Mechanism) are not even being contemplated.	欧元债券、单一欧洲财政部和增加欧洲共同援助资金（欧洲稳定性机制（European Stability Mechanism）和单一清算机制（Single Resolution Mechanism ） ） 等方案更是想都不用想。
Along with inadequate capital supply, Greece is suffering from a demand shortfall, as the troika continues to squeeze the country with harsh austerity.	除了资本供应不足，希腊还饱受需求短缺折磨，因为三驾马车一直在用严厉的紧缩挤压希腊。
If these policies are not relaxed or offset by more expansionary policies in the eurozone core, demand will remain depressed, discouraging further investment.	如果这些政策不放松，或没有欧元区核心国的宽松政策抵消其影响，则需求将继续受到抑制，从而抑制后续投资。
Finally, on the reform front, time is running out.	最后，在改革问题上，时间正在耗尽。
For the last few years, rather than confronting the special interests – state-protected businesses, public-sector trade unions, and lobbies – that inhibit reform, Greece has spread its economic misery horizontally through blanket spending cuts.	过去几年来，希腊并没有直面阻挠改革的特殊利益 — — 国家保护企业、公共部门工会和游说集团，而是用一刀切的减支推广了经济痛苦。
Reforms such as privatizing state-owned enterprises, opening up closed professions, abolishing restrictive business practices, and reducing the size of the public sector have been undertaken very slowly and inefficiently, and they will not significantly alter growth prospects.	私有化国有企业、开放封闭的行业、废除限制商业的行为、收缩公共部门规模等改革进展极慢、效率极低，也无法极大地改变增长前景。
As it stands, Greece is unlikely to meet the recovery challenge – and other peripheral economies will probably falter, too.	就目前而言，希腊无法应对复苏挑战 — — 其他外围经济体亦然。
Sufficient reforms and capital are lacking, while the social rifts resulting from austerity increase the risk of potentially devastating political instability.	它们缺少充分的改革和资本，而紧缩带来的社会分裂增加了爆发灾难性政治动荡的风险。
With the European Parliament election approaching, the prospect of populist anti-austerity parties prevailing in the periphery – and of anti-euro, anti-bailout parties gaining power in the core – heightens the risk of instability even more.	欧洲议会近在咫尺，民粹主义反紧缩政党在外围国大有夺权之势 — — 而反欧元、反援助政党则极有可能在核心国掌权 — — 发生动荡的可能性进一步增加了。
Should financial turbulence return and herald a new eurozone crisis, the monetary union’s sustainability will again be called into question.	如果金融动荡回归并且预示着新的欧元区危机，那么这一货币联盟的可持续性将再次产生疑问。
To prevent this outcome, Greece and the eurozone’s other peripheral economies must limit austerity, buttress demand, undertake reform, increase investment support, and pursue fiscal union.	为了防止这一结果，希腊和欧元区其他外围经济体必须限制紧缩、巩固需求、实施改革、增加投资支持并追求财政联盟。
Unfortunately, these keys to ensuring a cohesive and prosperous eurozone are likely to be left unturned – until, perhaps, the next crisis occurs.	不幸的是，这些确保团结、繁荣的欧元区的关键都不太可能取得突破 — — 也许要靠另一场危机的发生才行。
	
China’s Singapore Swing	中国转向新加坡
BEIJING – The Chinese Communist Party has released the final document of the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee.	北京—中共公布了十八大三中全会的最终文件。
In the CCP’s history, the third plenum has traditionally been the occasion for the party to announce its major policies for the next 5-10 years.	从历史上看，中共往往在三中全会上公布未来五到十年的重大政策。
This year happened to be one of leadership transition, so the third plenum became more important.	今年恰逢领导层过渡之年，因此三中全会也变得更加重要。
As expected, its final document unveils a plan for comprehensive reforms that will reshape China’s economy and society in the next decade.	如人们所期望的，此次三中全会的最终文件揭开了将决定未来十年中国经济和社会面貌的全面的改革计划。
For starters, the household registration (hukou) system will be reformed.	首先，户口制度将得到改革。
Small cities and towns will allow migrants to apply for the local hukou with no strings attached, and medium-size cities will do the same, with some restrictions.	小城市和建制镇将放开农民工落户申请，不再附带条件；中等城市也将如此，但会有一些限制。
Although large cities will remain as closed as ever, the new policy will dramatically weaken the institutional foundation of China’s long history of urban-rural and regional divides.	尽管大城市的大门仍如以往那样关闭着，但这一新政策将极大地削弱中国长期的城乡和地区差距的制度性基础。
Similarly, the one-child policy that has been enforced for the last 34 years will be modified.	类似地，强制执行了34年的独生子女政策也将修改。
In most provinces, parents who are both single children themselves already can have two children.	在大部分省份，双方本身都是独生子女的父母已经可以生育二胎。
The new policy recommends that provinces allow couples to have two children if either parent is a single child.	新政策建议各省允许任一方为独生子女的父母生育二胎。
While this will affect only around 10 million couples – a small number in a country of more than 1.3 billion people – the reform represents a gigantic step toward ending the one-child rule.	这项政策大概只能影响1000万对夫妻 — — 对于人口超过13亿的中国来说，这个数字只是九牛一毛 — — 但它代表了迈向结束独生子女规则的巨大一步。
Farmers, moreover, will be granted the right to sell their residential land on the open market and will be much more likely to be compensated at market rates when their land is taken by the government.	此外，农民将获得在公开市场上出售宅基地的权利，并大大提高他们在土地被政府征用时以市场价格获得补偿的机会。
State-owned enterprises (SOEs), meanwhile, are expected to surrender more of their profits to the government – up to 30% by 2020.	与此同时，国有企业将把更多的利润上缴给政府 — — 到2020年上缴比例最高将达到30 % 。
This extra revenue will be used to finance China’s social-security system.	这一额外的收入将用于充实社会保障系统。
Indeed, from now on, the central government will take over social-security expenditure, establishing nationally unified pension and health-insurance systems, while the retirement age will be raised gradually.	事实上，从现在开始，中央政府将接管社会保障支出，成立全国统一的养老金和医疗保险系统，同时退休年龄将逐渐提高。
Currently, women can retire at the age of 50, and men at 55 – ridiculously low by global standards and clearly unsustainable, given China’s rapidly aging population.	目前，女性退休年龄是50岁，男性是55岁 — — 以全球标准来看显然过低，且考虑到中国人口迅速老龄化的趋势，这显然是不可持续的。
SOEs’ power will be curtailed in other ways.	国有企业的权力还将受到其他方式的削弱。
Their ability to stifle innovation will be weakened by a drastic reduction in the government’s power to restrict the entry of new competitors into all areas of the economy, as well as a major effort to reduce bureaucratic red tape.	政府限制新竞争者进入经济各个领域的权力将大大受限，官僚主义繁文缛节也将遭到大力削弱，这将极大地降低国有企业对创新的制约作用。
Financial liberalization, too, will be deepened, which will help startups and private firms most of all.	金融自由化也将得到深化，受益最大的将是创业企业和民营企业。
In addition to pledging to liberalize exchange and interest rates, the final document also calls for allowing domestic private capital to form small and medium-size banks.	除了承诺汇率和利率自由化外，三中全会最终文件还要求允许国内民间资本组建中小型银行。
And, in an effort to bring coherence to commercial courts’ rulings, the court system will be directly financed by the central government, rather than by the corresponding local government.	此外，为了保证商业法庭裁决的一致性，法院系统将直接由中央政府而不是对应的地方政府提供资金。
This promises to strengthen the independence of the court system at the local level.	这将有利于增强地方层面法院系统的独立性。
All of these reforms have long been expected.	所有这些改革都是人们所长期期待的。
But the third plenum also provided surprises, including the creation of a leading group within the CCP to steer reform.	但此次三中全会还带来了惊喜，包括在党内成立全面深化改革领导小组。
China used to have a reform commission within the executive branch; the establishment of the leading group indicates the CCP’s commitment, and that of President Xi Jinping, to comprehensive reform.	中国的行政部门体系中已经有了发改委；领导小组的成立彰显出中共和习近平主席对全面改革的决心。
A second surprise is the document’s emphasis on the market.	第二个惊喜是文件对市场的强调。
In the past, government direction was emphasized, despite an acknowledgement of the market’s positive role.	过去尽管也承认市场的积极作用，但总是强调政府导向。
Now, for the first time, the CCP is officially calling for “allowing the market to take a central role in resource allocation.”	如今，中共首次正式要求“使市场在资源配置中起决定性作用 ” 。
A final surprise is that the document sets a timeframe to complete all of the reforms; by 2020, China is supposed to become a full-fledged market economy.	最后一个惊喜是为完成全部改革制定了时间表；中国准备在2020年建成成熟的市场经济。
This is the first time in recent history that the CCP has set a specific deadline for policymaking.	这是中共在最近一段时期首次为政策制定设置具体的期限。
And yet, while all of these measures are encouraging signs, some key items are missing.	但是，尽管所有这些措施都是令人鼓舞的信号，也有一些关键点没有触及。
For example, there was no clear mention of further SOE reform.	比如，文件没有明确提出进一步改革国有企业。
Likewise, though the document calls for strengthening local legislatures, it proposes no concrete plan to curb local governments’ role in economic activities, which is one of the sources of distortions in the Chinese economy.	类似地，尽管文件要求加强地方立法机构，但并没有拿出具体的计划限制地方政府在经济活动中的角色，而这是中国经济扭曲的来源之一。
This is related to the final document’s most significant lacuna: political reform.	这与最终文件最重要的空白有关：政治改革。
In fact, a Singapore-style approach – combining a freewheeling market economy and an authoritarian regime – has clearly emerged from the plenum.	事实上，三中全会显然决定采取新加坡式的方针 — — 自由市场经济和专制政权相结合。
It is an approach that awaits the test of time.	这一方针有待时间的检验。
Singapore is a city-state of five million people – roughly the population of the Haidian district of Beijing.	新加坡是一个城市国家，只有500万人口 — — 大概和北京市海淀区相当。
Given China’s much greater size and complexity, the Chinese government’s pursuit of the Singaporean model, with its suppression of any and all social disorder, would ultimately undermine economic dynamism.	中国的规模和复杂性远甚于新加坡，因此中国政府追求新加坡模式以及对一切社会动荡采取高压手段最终会破坏经济活力。
To build the innovative economy envisioned by the third plenum, the CCP’s leadership needs to find a new governance model that fosters a vibrant society.	为了建设三中全会提出的创新型经济，中共领导层需要找到能培养有活力的社会的新的治理模式。
Sooner rather than later, the crucially important economic reforms that have just been unveiled will not be enough.	很快，刚刚展开的具有关键重要性的经济改革便会显得后劲不足。
	
China’s Real-Estate Wrongs	中国的房地产问题
BEIJING – China’s real-estate sector has been a source of serious concern for several years, with soaring property prices raising fears of overheating in the housing market.	北京—几年来，中国的房地产业已成为一个严重忧虑，一飞冲天的房地产价格让人们担心住房市场存在过热。
But, with price growth easing, it seems that the government’s campaign to rein in property risk is finally taking hold.	但是，随着价格涨势的减缓，政府遏制房地产风险的举措似乎终于见效了。
The danger now is that the housing market will collapse – bringing China’s economic prospects down with it.	现在的危险是住房市场可能崩溃，并将中国经济前景也拖下水。
In its effort to control rising housing prices, China’s government has pursued nine distinct policies, not all of which have served their purpose.	为了控制房价上涨，中国政府采取了九项不同政策，但并非每一项政策都达到了效果。
Though policies like limits on mortgages for first-time buyers and minimum residency requirements for purchasing property in a first-tier city like Beijing or Shanghai helped to ease demand, supply-side tactics, such as limiting credit to real-estate developers and imposing new taxes on property sales, have proved to be counter-productive.	尽管将按揭限定于首次购房者、北京和上海等一线城市要求达到最低定居时限才能买房等政策有助于遏制需求，但供给端的策略，如限制房地产开发商信贷、实施新房销售税等，效果适得其反。
This flawed approach allowed China’s housing prices to continue to rise steadily, fueling major housing bubbles, especially in first-tier cities.	这一存在缺陷的方针让中国房价继续稳步上升，催生了巨大的住房泡沫，特别是在一线城市。
The average Beijing resident would have to save all of his or her income for 34 years before to be able to purchase an apartment outright.	普通北京居民需要将收入不吃不喝存34年才能全款购买一套公寓。
In Shanghai and Guangzhou, the equivalent is 29 and 27 years, respectively – much higher than in other major international cities.	上海和广州则分别为29年和27年 — — 远远高于其他国际大城市。
The expectation that this trend will continue has driven homeowners to retain possession of their properties, even though rental rates amount to less than 2% of a property’s market value.	预期这一趋势还会持续让业主继续持有自己的房产，即便房租率只相当于房产市值的不到2 % 。
But, with the real-estate sector finally facing a downturn, the time to rethink this investment strategy has arrived.	但是，随着房地产业最终开始面临下降趋势，反思这一投资战略的时间也已到来。
In the first four months of 2014, housing sales dropped by nearly 7% year on year, with construction of new floor area falling by more than 22%.	2014年前四个月，住房销售同比下降近7 % ， 新建楼面面积下降22%以上。
As a result, downward pressure on property prices is mounting.	照此看，房价下跌压力正在积聚。
In normal times, citizens and officials alike would welcome this trend.	在正常时期，公民和官员都会欢迎这一趋势。
But, at a time of weakening economic performance, China cannot afford an implosion of the real-estate sector, which accounts for at least 30% of overall growth.	但是，在经济表现不力的时候，中国无法承担至少贡献了增长总量30%的房地产业崩溃。
Indeed, though China’s government has expressed its willingness to sacrifice some growth in its pursuit of structural reform and rebalancing, the impact of a housing-market collapse on the financial sector would cause growth to slow beyond the acceptable limit.	事实上，尽管中国政府表示愿意为结构改革和再平衡牺牲一些增长，但住房市场崩溃对金融业的冲击会导致增长下降至远低于可接受下限的水平。
That impact partly reflects the highly problematic nature of the Chinese government’s long-awaited move to liberalize interest rates.	这一冲击部分反映了人们期待已久的中国政府放松利率管制的政策有很大问题。
Instead of taking a direct approach – lifting the interest-rate cap imposed on banks – liberalization has been achieved by allowing shadow banking to flourish.	利率自由化并没有采取直接方式 — — 提高银行利率上限 — — 而是通过允许影子银行兴盛的方式实现。
As a result, a large number of nonbank financial institutions – such as wealth-management companies and online financial-services providers – are now using promises of high returns to attract small investors.	结果，如今大量非银行金融机构 — — 如理财公司和在线金融服务商 — — 以高回报承诺吸引小投资者。
Making matters worse, the monetary authorities have tightened the credit supply, in an effort to deleverage the Chinese economy.	更糟糕的是，货币当局收紧了信用供给以促进中国经济去杠杆化。
While both interest-rate liberalization and deleveraging are critical to the long-term health of China’s economy, the skyrocketing cost of borrowing is forcing many low-risk companies, which are unable to offer sufficiently high rates of return, out of the market.	尽管利率自由化和去杠杆化对中国经济的长期健康至关重要，但高企的借贷成本迫使许多低风险公司因为无法提供足够高的回报率而被挤出市场。
At the same time, real-estate developers who have borrowed heavily from shadow-banking institutions, based on the assumption that property prices would continue to rise steadily, may struggle to repay their debts, with a sharp decline in prices inevitably leading to defaults.	与此同时，认为房价将继续稳步上升而大量从影子银行机构举债房地产开发商可能难以偿还债务，价格的急剧下跌将不可避免地导致违约。
Given that the formal banking sector provides a large share of shadow-banking finance, this could initiate a chain reaction affecting the entire financial sector.	考虑到影子银行金融的很大一部分资金来自正式银行部门，这可能导致影响整个金融业的连锁反应。
Many remain convinced that China’s government – which wields with the world’s largest foreign-exchange reserves and virtually unchecked authority – would be able to prevent a major financial crisis.	许多人仍认为坐拥世界第一大规模外汇储备、拥有几乎无限权力的中国政府能够避免重大金融危机。
But the financial crisis in the fast-growing city of Wenzhou, triggered by bad loans, suggests otherwise – not least because the economy has yet to recover fully.	但高增长城市温州因为坏账而发生了金融危机，这表明上述观点未必正确 — — 因为经济尚未完全复苏。
There is no reason to believe that a similar crisis could not occur on a national scale.	没有理由认为类似的危机不可能在全国���围内发生。
To avoid such an outcome, China’s leaders must urgently adopt counter-cyclical measures.	为了避免这样的结果，中国领导人必须紧急采取反周期措施。
They should begin by eliminating non-market-based restrictions on the real-estate sector, which have generated serious distortions not only to the economy, but also to people’s lives, with couples divorcing temporarily to gain the right to purchase an additional apartment.	他们应该从取消房地产业的非市场限制开始，这些限制所造成的严重扭曲不但影响了经济，也影响了人民的生活，许多人不惜假离婚以获得购买第二套公寓的权利。
When it comes to the real-estate sector, China’s government has consistently had the right objective and the wrong strategy.	在房地产业的问题上，中国政府一直在用错误的战略追求正确的目标。
It is time to align intention with action.	目的和行动之间应该一致。
Otherwise, China’s financial sector – indeed, its entire economy – will suffer.	否则，中国的金融业 — — 事实上，是整个经济 — — 都要遭殃。
	
In Praise of China’s New Normal	为中国的新常态欢呼
BEIJING – China’s economy is, at long last, undergoing a rebalancing, with growth rates having declined from more than 10% before 2008 to roughly 7.5% today.	发自北京 — — 在经过了漫长的等待之后，中国经济终于启动了结构再平衡进程，增长率也从2008年以前的超过10%下降到如今的约7.5 % 。
Is this China’s “new normal,” or should the country anticipate even slower growth in the coming decade?	这是否就是中国的“新常态 ” ， 还是这个国家预期在未来十年内会出现更低的增长？
China’s rebalancing is apparent, first and foremost, in the export sector.	首先，中国经济在出口部门方面的再平衡是显而易见的。
Export growth has slowed from its 2001-2008 average of 29% annually to below 10%, making foreign demand a far less critical engine of growth.	出口增长从2001~2008年间的年均29%下降到低于10 % ， 使得国外需求作为增长引擎的作用不再如此重要。
Moreover, manufacturing employment and output, as a share of the total, began to decline last year.	此外，制造业就业和产出占总体的比重在去年开始下降。
In fact, in the first half of this year, services accounted for more than half of total economic growth.	在今年上半年，服务业占据了总体经济增长的超过一半。
It is no surprise, then, that China’s current-account surplus has shrunk rapidly, from its 2007 peak of more than 10% of GDP to about 2% of GDP today.	因此中国的经常账户顺差从2007年占GDP超过10%的顶峰迅速下跌如今大概2%的情况也就不出所料了，
This rebalancing has helped to improve China’s income distribution.	这一再平衡帮助改善了中国的收入分配状况。
Indeed, in recent years, labor’s share of national income has been on the rise – a direct reflection of the decline in manufacturing and expansion in services.	事实上近年来劳动工资收入在国民收入中的比重有所上升 — — 这也直接反映出制造业的收缩和服务业的扩大。
That has meant greater regional balance as well: The coastal provinces, which produce more than 85% of the country’s exports, are experiencing the most pronounced slowdown, while inland provinces have maintained relatively high growth rates.	这同时也意味着更深层次的区域性再平衡状况：占中国出口总量超过85%的沿海省份正经历着最为显著的放缓过程，而内陆省份则维持着较高的增长率。
As a result, China’s Gini coefficient (a 100-point index of inequality, in which zero signifies absolute equality and one absolute inequality) fell to 0.50 in 2012, from 0.52 in 2010.	在这样的形势下中国的基尼系数（定量测定收入分配差异程度的指数，其值在0和1之间，0表示收入分配极端平等而1表示极端不平等）从2012年的0.52下跌到了2012年的0.5。
Two principal factors are driving this shift.	推动这一转变的是两大基本因素。
The first is the decline in global demand in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, which has forced China to adjust its growth model sooner than anticipated.	其一是2008年金融危机以来全球需求下降，迫使中国提前开始调整自身增长模式。
The second is China’s ongoing demographic transformation.	其二则是中国人口结构的不断转变。
The share of working-age people (16-65 years old) in the total population has been declining since its 2010 peak of 72%.	处于16~65岁之间的劳动人口占总人口的比例自2010年达到最高72%后逐年下降。
And the absolute number of working-age people has been falling since 2012.	而劳动人口的绝对数量也自2012年后不断减少。
At the same time, China is undergoing rapid urbanization, with some 200 million people having left the agricultural sector in 2001-2008 to seek urban manufacturing jobs.	与此同时，中国正处于高速城市化进程之中，在2001~2008年间有约200万人脱离农业寻找城市制造业工作。
More recently, however, the pace of migration has slowed substantially, with rural areas retaining 35% of China’s total labor force.	但近年以来这一移民进程持续放缓，而农村地区则吸收了全国劳动者总数的35 % 。
All of this implies lower growth rates for China – though perhaps not as low as the 6-7% rates that economists like Liu Shijing and Cai Fang are predicting for the next decade.	所有这些都体现出中国更低的增长率 — — 虽然可能不会像经济学家刘世锦，蔡方所预计的那样低到6~7 % 。
In fact, relying on China’s past growth record to predict future performance is inherently problematic, owing not only to important shifts in the labor force, but also to the fact that the speed and scale of China’s pre-2008 growth was unprecedented.	事实上，依靠中国过去的增长记录去预测未来的经济表现显然是站不住脚的，不仅仅是因为劳动人口方面的重大转换，还必须认识到中国在2008年之前的发展速度和规模都是前所未有的。
For starters, it is likely that the contribution to output growth of the rising ratio of working-age people prior to 2010 was overestimated.	首先，在2010年以前劳动人口数量增长率对生产增长的贡献很可能被高估了。
That makes the subsequent decline in the ratio an inaccurate measure with which to determine the negative impact on economic performance.	这使得随后该比率的下跌成为了测定经济负面影响的一个不准确手段。
Moreover, this approach neglects the educational dividends that China will enjoy over the next 20 years, as the younger generation replaces older workers.	此外，这一手段忽视了中国在未来20年间享受的教育红利，因为新一代劳动者正不断取代老一辈。
As it stands, the rate of return-adjusted educational attainment for Chinese aged 50-60 is half that of those aged 20-25. In other words, young workers will be twice as productive as those entering retirement.	按照这一情况，50~60岁年龄段中国人的收入/受教育程度比率只有20~25岁年龄段的一半，换句话说，新一代劳动者的生产力将是临近退休者的一倍。
Indeed, the level of educational attainment in China continues to improve.	事实上，中国国民的教育水平正不断提升。
By 2020, the share of those aged 18-22 who are pursuing a college education will reach 40%, compared to 32% today.	到2020年，在大学求学的18~22岁青年将占到该年龄段总人口的40 % ， 而目前为32 % 。
This improvement in human capital is bound to offset, to some extent, the net loss of labor.	这种人力资本的提升将在一定程度上补偿劳动力的净流失。
Furthermore, China’s low retirement age – 50 for women and 60 for men – provides policymakers with considerable room to maneuver.	与此同时，中国的低退休年龄 — — 女性50岁和/男性60岁 — — 为政策制定者们提供了相当大的回旋余地。
Increasing the retirement age by just a half-year for each of the next ten years would more than compensate for the annual decline in the labor force, which is projected to be 2.5 million workers during this period.	只需在未来每十年将退休年龄提高半年就足以补偿每年约250万劳动力的流失。
Other trends are boosting China’s prospects further.	还有另一个趋势在进一步推动中国的繁荣。
Though investment is likely to decline as a share of GDP, it will probably take a decade for it to dip below 40% – still robust by international standards.	虽然投资占GDP的比重不断降低，但可能需要十年的时间才能降到低于40 % — —按照国际标准来说这一比率依然较高。
Meanwhile, the capital stock can maintain a reasonable growth rate.	同时资本存量也会维持较高的增长率。
Finally, China’s capacity for innovation is improving steadily, owing to rapidly increasing human capital and rising investment in research and development.	最后，因为人力资本迅速增加和研究投资的不断增长，中国的创新能力正在稳步提升。
By next year, Chinese R&D expenditure, at 2.2% of GDP, will be closing in on advanced-country levels.	明年中国的研究支出将相当于GDP的2.2 % ， 接近发达国家的水平。
Based on these trends – and assuming a constant labor-participation rate – China’s potential growth rate over the next decade is likely to hover around 6.9-7.6%, averaging 7.27%.	基于这些趋势 — — 并假设一个持续的劳动参与率 — — 中国在未来10年的潜在增长率将在6.9~7.6之间波动，平均为7.27 % 。
This may be much lower than the 9.4% average growth rate in 1988-2013, but it is more than adequate by global standards.	这个数字或许比1988~2013年间的年均9.4%低得多，但相对于全球标准来说这已经足够了。
If this is China’s “new normal,” it would still be the envy of the rest of the world.	如果这就是中国的“新常态 ” ， 那么依然会是个令全世界羡慕不已的状况。
	
China’s Shadow Menace	中国的影子威胁
BEIJING – The US Federal Reserve’s decision to exit from so-called “quantitative easing” – its massive monthly purchases of long-term assets – is stoking fears of a hard economic landing in China.	北京—美联储退出所谓”量化宽松 ” （ 大规模月度长期资产购买）的决定正在引起关于中国经济硬着陆的恐慌。
But China’s strong economic fundamentals mean that policymakers have the space to avoid such an outcome – as long as they bring the country’s shadow banking system under control.	但中国强大的经济基本面意味着决策者有空间避免这一结果 — — 只要他们能将中国的影子银行系统控制住。
As it stands, Chinese consumption and investment growth is expected to remain at roughly last year’s levels.	目前，中国消费和投资增长预计将维持与去年相当的水平。
Meanwhile, economic recovery in the advanced economies, especially the United States and Europe, is reinvigorating external demand, leading analysts to project annual Chinese export growth of more than 10% this year – 3-4 percentage points higher than in 2013.	与此同时，发达经济体（特别是美国和欧洲）的经济复苏正在重新刺激外需，这让分析师们预测今年中国出口年怎张率将超过10 % ， 比2013年高3—4个百分点。
This would bring annual GDP growth in 2014 to a very healthy 7.5-8%.	这将让2014年GDP增长率达到相当健康的7.5—8 % 。
The problem is that China’s financial sector has accumulated considerable risk in recent years, with broad money (M2) having ballooned to ¥110.7 trillion ($18 trillion) – almost twice the country’s GDP – at the end of last year.	问题在于，近几年来中国金融部门累积了大量风险，到去年年底，广义货币（M2）总量膨胀到110.7万亿元，接近GDP的两倍。
In an attempt to rein in M2, which could indicate that the economy is overleveraged, the central bank tightened conditions for commercial bank lending, so that, for any given increase in M2, less credit is extended.	为了遏制M2 — — 该指标表明中国经济有杠杆过高之嫌 — — 中国人民银行收紧了商业银行贷款标准，因此，对于任何给定的M2增量，信用增量下降了。
But the move failed to contain M2 growth; on the contrary, M2 grew faster last year than in 2012.	但这一措施并未遏制M2的增长；相反，去年M2增长比2012年更快。
Worse, restricting commercial banks’ role as financial intermediaries and encouraging the growth of unregulated shadow banking has generated even more risks for China’s economy.	更糟糕的是，限制商业银行作为金融媒介的角色、鼓励不受监管的影子银行的增长已经给中国经济带来了更大的风险。
Clearly, a new approach is needed – one that is based on a deeper understanding of the dangers inherent in China’s banking system.	显然，中国需要新方针 — — 基于对中国银行体系内部风险更深认识的方针。
While it is true that surging M2 can reflect excessive leverage, it is not a particularly accurate gauge in China, where commercial banks can easily circumvent high reserve requirements and quantitative controls by moving loans off their balance sheets to wealth-management products – practices that fuel artificial credit expansion that looks like M2 growth.	诚然，M2的飙涨可能反映了过高的杠杆，但这在中国并不是一个特别准确标尺。 中国的商业银行可以轻松地规避高储备金要求和量化控制手段，只要将它们的贷款从资产负债表移到理财产品即可 — — 如此形成的人为信用扩张与M2增长十分接近。
In this sense, it is the Chinese monetary authorities’ reluctance to open up the formal financial sector to domestic private capital, or to liberalize the deposit rate, that is fueling the expansion of shadow banking.	照此看，助长影子银行扩张的恰恰是中国货币当局不愿向国内私人资本放开正式银行部门和实施存款利率自由化。
With small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) – by far the economy’s most important growth engine – unable to acquire sufficient funding from the formal financial sector, they have been forced to turn to informal channels.	中小企业 — — 目前它们是中国经济最重要的增长引擎 — — 无法通过正式金融部门获得足够的融资，被迫转向非正式渠道。
As shadow banking has become the primary source of finance for SMEs – which tend to be higher-risk borrowers – the financial risks in China’s economy have grown exponentially.	随着影子银行变成中小企业的主要融资源 — — 而中小企业总是风险较高的借款人 — — 中国经济的金融风险呈现出指数增长。
Exacerbating matters, the central bank’s repeated efforts to tighten the money supply raises the cost of capital.	雪上加霜的是，中国人民银行一再收紧货币供给，从而提高了资本成本。
Last June, the annualized interbank lending rate surged to more than 10% – a level that it almost matched in December.	去年6月，年化银行间拆借利率飙升到10%以上，12月又几乎重演了一次。
SMEs ultimately shoulder these costs, diminishing their ability to contribute to overall economic growth.	中小企业是这一成本的最终承担者，它们对总体经济增长的贡献能力也因此受到了制约。
Consider the Internet giant Alibaba, which began using Zhi-fu-bao, the Chinese equivalent of PayPal, to raise money last year.	以互联网巨头阿里巴巴为例。 去年，阿里巴巴开始利用支付宝融资。
In just a few months, it received ¥400 billion from 85 million small investors.	不出几个月，支付宝就收到了来自8,500万小投资者的4,000亿元资金。
Tencent, China’s largest Internet company, is now using the same strategy to compete with Alibaba, with both companies offering high rates of return – often 6-7% annually – to attract as many investors as possible.	中国最大的互联万公司腾讯公司现在正在用同样的战略与阿里巴巴竞争。 不管是腾讯还是阿里巴巴，都给出了相当高的回报率 — — 年化水平通常可达6—7 % — —来吸引尽可能多的投资者。
The problem is that most of this investment is in the interbank market, meaning that SMEs ultimately face interest rates of more than 10% – and that does not include the added 3% for SMEs’ loan guarantees.	问题在于这些投资的主要去向正是银行间市场，这意味着中小企业最终面临超过10%的利率 — — 还不包括3%的额外的中小企业贷款担保。
These unsustainable high rates are transmitting major risks to the real economy.	这一不可持续的高利率正在把巨大的风险转移给实体经济。
Nowhere is this more apparent than in the real-estate sector.	最能说明这一问题的莫过于房地产业了。
Liquidity-thirsty developers, unable to acquire financing through the formal banking sector, have been taking out massive loans at extremely high interest rates.	急需流动性的开发商由于无法从正式银行部门获得融资，不得不以极高的利率借入大量贷款。
But, in many cases, housing demand has not grown as expected, raising the risk of default – the effects of which would be transmitted to the entire financial sector.	但是，在许多情形中，房地产需求的增长赶不上预期，这提高了违约风险 — — 其效应将传递给整个金融部门。
The fact is that China has never been closer to a major financial crisis than it is today.	事实上，中国从未像今天那样如此接近重大金融危机。
Yet China’s monetary authorities do not seem to understand the scale of the risk – or its root causes.	但中国货币当局似乎并不清楚风险的规模，也不清楚它的根源。
The Chinese economy may well need to be deleveraged.	中国经济或许急需去杠杆。
But, instead of blindly tightening the credit supply, policymakers must pursue deep financial-sector reform to liberalize the deposit rate, eliminate quantitative controls, and, most important, allow for the establishment of domestic private financial institutions.	但是，决策不能盲目地收紧信用供给，而必须深化金融部门改革，实现存款利率自由化，取消量化工具，最重要的是，必须允许成立国内私人金融机构。
Pursuing this agenda is essential to China’s long-term financial and economic health.	追求这些日程对于中国的长期金融和经济健康来说是至关重要的。
But doing so presupposes a major shift in Chinese monetary authorities’ mindset.	但这样做需要中国货币当局转换思维。
Therein lies the real challenge facing China today.	而中国今天所面临的挑战也正在这里。
	
Will the Yellow Vests Reject the Brown Shirts?	黄背心会抵制棕衫队吗？
PARIS – From the moment the French government canceled its planned fuel tax hike in the face of massive protests, it was obvious that the move would be perceived as inadequate, insignificant, and above all incapable of having any calming effect.	巴黎 — — 从法国政府面对大规模抗议活动取消其原计划大幅上调燃油税的那一刻起，显而易见，人们对此次运动的看法将会是不充分、不足道，而且最重要的是，无法带来任何安抚情绪的效果。
Honor to whom honor is due: the Yellow Vests claim to be an expression of the sovereign people.	荣誉属于那些值得赞许的人：黄背心自称是主权民众的代表。
But they now bear a heavy responsibility.	但他们现在所肩负的责任却是沉重的。
For starters, they must announce a moratorium on demonstrations and blockades for a period long enough to accommodate the dialogue proposed by Prime Minister Édouard Philippe, if not longer.	首先，他们必须宣布一段足够长的示威和封锁暂停期，以允许总理爱德华·菲利普所提出的对话。
In particular, they should renounce the much-touted December 8 “Act IV” of the movement, brewing on Facebook since Saturday evening, which everyone expects to be more violent, destructive, and tragic than the preceding installments.	特别是，他们应当放弃此次备受追捧的12月8日运动“第四幕”计划，该计划从周六傍晚起就在Facebook上被传得沸沸扬扬，所有人都预计这次行动会比前几次更暴力、更具破坏性，也更具悲剧色彩。
There have been enough deaths, injuries, and damage (including to some of the most famous monuments in Paris).	最近发生的死亡、伤害和破坏（包括对巴黎某些最著名的遗迹）已经足够多了。
If the Yellow Vests decide the machine they have unleashed has overtaken them, and they can no longer stop Act IV, they must be prepared during the protests to help the police flush out the violent “brown vests” who will be circulating among them.	如果黄背心们认为他们启动的机器已经超出了自身的控制，而且他们无法再阻止第四幕的发生，那么他们必须随时准备配合警察开展对混在他们当中崇尚暴力的“棕背心”的清洗活动。
Because the wreckers of the far right and far left will surely reappear to vandalize, terrorize, and desecrate; it is up to the Yellow Vests to say once again, this time as if they really mean it: Not in our name.	因为极右翼和极左翼肇事者肯定会再次出现，破坏、恐吓并亵渎这次运动；黄背心们必须再次明确表态，而且这次表态必须非常郑重：这并不是我们想要的效果。
Whether the Yellow Vests declare a moratorium or continue to protest, nothing would serve their cause better than to dissociate themselves – decisively and unambiguously – from all the political profiteers who would capitalize on their misery.	无论黄背心宣布暂停抑或继续抗议活动，对他们而言最好的策略都是果断且毫不含糊地与那些利用他们痛苦的政治投机者脱钩。
The cast of opportunists is well known.	机会主义者的阵容是人尽皆知的。
Here is Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who, having finished fourth in the 2017 presidential election won by Emmanuel Macron, is desperately seeking a new following.	其中包括梅朗雄，他在2017年总统大选中排名第四，位列胜选的伊曼纽尔·马克龙之后，而他现在正拼命寻求新的支持者。
There is François Ruffin, the leader of the anti-austerity movement Nuit debout, with his irresponsible anti-republican calls of “Resign, Macron!” And over there is Marine Le Pen, oscillating comically between taking pride in and repenting her call to occupy the Champs Élysées last Saturday, thereby becoming accountable for the worst of what was said and done there.	此外还包括弗朗索瓦·鲁芬，鲁芬是反紧缩运动Nuit debout的领袖，他一直到处散播不负责任的反共和言论，不断高呼“辞职，马克龙 ! ” 此外，阵容中还包括马琳·勒庞，她在为上周六占领香榭丽舍大街感到骄傲和悔恨之间不停地摇摆，因此可以说，她应当为那里所发生的最糟局面负责。
And there the intellectuals who, in the manner of Luc Ferry and Emmanuel Todd, suggest that it was perhaps not “by chance” that the wreckers had such an easy time approaching, storming, and sacking the Arc de Triomphe.	还有像卢克·费里和伊曼纽尔·托德那样的知识分子，他们认为破坏者如此轻而易举地靠近、攻陷和洗劫凯旋门可能并不是“偶然”的。
Such rhetoric lays the worst of all traps for a popular movement: the trap of conspiratorial thinking.	上述言论为群众运动所能陷入的最可怕陷阱打下了基础：那就是阴谋论思维。
In other words, the Yellow Vests are at a crossroads.	换言之，黄背心们正站在十字路口。
Either they will be bold enough to stop and take the time they need to get organized, following a path not unlike that of Macron’s own La République en Marche !, which, in hindsight, might appear to be the Yellow Vests’ first-to-arrive twin.	他们或者大胆地停下来，留出足够的时间重新组织，然后再沿着与马克龙自身的法国前进运动类似的道路继续往前走。 事后看来，马克龙的法国前进运动似乎与黄背心们有着诸多的相似之处。
Macron’s movement, too, had right and left wings. And it knew that it was a new political body, engaging in a dialogue or even a showdown that would lead to an honest reckoning with poverty and the high cost of living.	马克龙的运动同样分为右翼和左翼，而且它清楚自身是新的政治机构，因此全心全意进行对话甚至是摊牌，从而促使人们对贫困和生活成本居高不下等问题进行诚实的思考。
If the Yellow Vests build a movement that rises to the height of Macron’s, it may end up writing a page in the history of France.	如果黄背心最终发展为一个与马克龙达到同等高度的运动，那么它可能最终会被记入到法国的史书。
Or the Yellow Vests may turn out to lack that boldness and settle for the paltry pleasure of being seen on television.	黄背心也可以被事实证明缺乏必要的胆略，并因为受到电视报道这样微不足道的乐趣而满足。
They will allow themselves to become intoxicated by the sight of luminaries and experts of la France d’en haut (elite France) seeming to eat from their hands and hanging on their every word.	他们将允许自己为得到la France den haut（精英法国）的名人和专家的注意力所陶醉，看似心甘情愿地被他们所豢养并对他们的所有命令言听计从。
But if the Yellow Vests allow passionate hate to win out over genuine fraternity and choose wrecking over reforming, they will bring only chaos, not improvement, to the lives of humble and vulnerable people.	但如果黄背心允许激情仇恨压倒真正的兄弟情谊并选择破坏改革，那么他们只能祸乱而非改善卑微和脆弱民众的生活。
They will careen off into the darkest side of the political night, and end up in the dustbin of history, where they can rub elbows with those other yellows, the early-twentieth-century “Yellow Socialists” of the proto-fascist syndicalist Pierre Biétry.	他们将陷入到政治黑夜最黑暗的一面，并最终被扫进历史的垃圾箱，在那里他们会与其他黄色运动不期而遇，比如20世纪初期皮埃尔·比奇特的亲法西斯工团“黄色社会主义者 ” 。
The Yellow Vests must choose: democratic re-invention, or an updated version of the national socialist leagues; a will to repair, or the urge to destroy.	黄背心们必须在民主再造或国家社会主义联盟升级版之间作出选择；两者之间的差异在于修复的愿望抑或毁灭的冲动。
The decision will hinge on the historic essence of the movement – whether its reflexes are good or bad, and whether, in the final analysis, it possesses political and moral courage.	他们的决定将决定该运动的历史本质 — — 决定其反应是好是坏，以及归根结底，它是否是政治和道德勇气的秉持者。
So the ball is in the Yellow Vests’ court.	因此球就在黄背心的脚下。
They have the initiative as much as Macron does.	他们手握的主动权并不亚于马克龙。
Will they say, “Yes, we believe in republican democracy?”	他们会说 ， “ 是的，我们相信共和民主 ？ ”
And will they say it loud and clear, without equivocation?	他们会不会就此作出毫不含糊的明确表达？
Or will they place themselves in the tradition of paranoid nihilism and pollute their ranks with the political vandals that France still produces in abundance?	或者他们会屈服于偏执无政府主义的传统，最终任由依然在法国大量存在的政治破坏者们污染他们的队伍？
	
Did US Drone Strikes Lose Yemen?	美国无人机打击输掉了也门吗？
NEW YORK – Recent revelations that the US killed an innocent American in a drone strike in Pakistan confirm what a new study, “Death by Drone,” of civilian harm caused by US drone strikes in Yemen shows – that claims about the precision of drone strikes are overstated.	纽约—最近，也门滑入了危机，这激起了一场争论：美国总统奥巴马政府称其在也门实施的以无人机打击为核心的反恐战略取得了成功是否错误。
The revelations also underscore the stark asymmetry between how the US treats drone strikes that kill its own citizens and those that kill others. While the Obama administration has now publicly acknowledged that it has recently killed three US citizens in drone strikes, it has refused to acknowledge countless other drone strikes around the world which have killed non-US civilians.	事实上，最新报告《死于无人机 》 （ Death by Drone）指出，即使最近的危机不曾爆发，美国无人机打击给也门平民所造成的伤害也足以应该让美国反思这一战略。
In Yemen, the US has been conducting drone strikes since at least 2002, with estimates of the total number of strikes ranging from 91 to 203.	美国至少早在2002年就开始在也门实施无人机打击，总打击次数估计在90次到198次。
While the American and Yemeni governments have lauded the drones’ precise targeting, they have refused to meaningfully disclose key details about the strikes, including how many have been conducted, who has been targeted, or, crucially, the number and identities of civilians killed.	美国和也门政府大肆宣传无人机的精确定位，但拒绝披露打击的关键细节，包括阻止了多少次、以谁为打击目标，以及最关键的，误杀的平民数量和身份。
In a May 2013 speech at the National Defense University, Obama offered assurances that, outside the Afghan war theater, no drone strike would be carried out unless there was “near-certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured.”	在 2013年5月的国防大学（National Defense University）演讲中，奥巴马信誓旦旦地表示，在阿富汗战场之外，除非“几乎肯定不会有平民伤亡 ， ” 否则就不会实施无人机打击。
Obama also claimed that the US targets only “terrorists who pose a continuing and imminent threat to the American people,” and that it does not launch drone strikes when it has “the ability to capture individual terrorists.”	（总体而言，他的确承认美国无人机打击导致了平民伤亡。 ）奥巴马还宣称美国的目标只是“不断地对美国人造成紧迫威胁的恐怖分子 ， ” 美国不会在具备“捕获个体恐怖分子的能力”的情况下发动无人机打击。
“Death by Drone,” which includes first-hand testimony from eyewitnesses and survivors of drone strikes in Yemen, tells a different story.	《死于无人机》包括了也门无人机打击的目击者和幸存者的第一手证词，它向我们讲述了一个完全不同的故事。
The nine case studies documented in the report, four of which cover attacks that came after the 2013 speech, provide credible evidence that US drone strikes have killed and injured Yemeni civilians, suggesting that the “near-certainty” standard is not being effectively implemented.	报告中所记录的九个案例 — — 其中四个包括奥巴马2013年演讲之后所实施的打击 — — 以如山铁证证明美国无人机打击造成了也门平民伤亡，并指出“几乎肯定”标准并没有被有效实施。
The report also casts doubt on Obama’s other claims, with evidence indicating that targets of drone strikes, though perhaps posing a threat to Yemen, may not have posed a direct threat to the US, and that their capture may have been possible.	报告还质疑了奥巴马的另一个说法。 报告提出证据证明，无人机打击目标 — — 尽管他们也许给也门造成了威胁 — — 未必对美国造成直接威胁，并且捕获他们也不是没有可能。
In other words, Yemeni civilians have suffered and died from drone strikes that may not have been necessary.	换句话说，也门贫民因为未必需要的无人机打击而遭遇伤亡。
More generally, the report provides a window into the experiences of Yemeni civilians directly affected by US drone strikes.	对于被杀平民的家庭而言，无法证明无人机打击的必要性 — — 甚至不直接承认实施了无人机打击 — — 让他们更加无法接受家人的死亡。
The testimonies of these individuals, vital for assessing the US drone program, are all too easy to overlook because these individuals are poor and have no political influence, and because the strikes are conducted in secret, far away from the US.	2014年4月19日在美国无人机打击身亡的四位无辜平民之一的纳赛尔·穆罕默德·纳赛尔（Nasser Mohammed Nasser）的父亲哀痛地说 ： “ 我儿子以及和他一起死去的人和基地组织毫无瓜葛。 他们只是在讨生活的路上。
	既然如此，美国飞机为什么还要攻击他们 ？ ”
As Yaslem Saeed bin Ishaq, whose son was killed in a US drone strike in Wadi Sir on August 1, 2013, observed, “They just kill.	当然，从距离遥远还往往保密的地方打着国家安全的旗号发动无人机打击在政治上相对容易一些。
They do not know what havoc their missiles have caused. They are unaware of the suffering they create for our families.”	当受打击影响的平民是缺少政治影响力的穷人、因此没有什么能力吸引媒体眼球时，发动打击就更加容易了。
Indeed, if the US never acknowledges the specific strikes, how can ordinary Americans possibly know that Rasilah al-Faqih, a pregnant Yemeni woman, was killed in Walad Rabei’, along with her husband and ten-year-old daughter, as they headed home from a visit to the doctor?	亚斯勒姆·赛义德·本·依沙克（Yaslem Saeed bin Ishaq）的儿子在2013年瓦迪瑟（Wadi Sir）美国无人机打击中身亡，他观察道 ： “ 他们只是为了杀戮。
Or that Abdoh Mohammed al-Jarraah’s house in Silat al-Jarraah had 19 people, including women and children, inside when it was hit by a US drone strike?	他们根本不知道他们的导弹造成了怎样的破坏。 他们不知道他们给我们的家庭造成了多大的痛苦 。 ”
The US’ refusal to acknowledge drone strikes that kill foreigners is sending a damaging message in Yemen and beyond.	事实上，如果美国不承认具体的打击，普通美国人如何能够知道也门孕妇拉西拉·法基赫（Rasilah al-Faqih）在瓦拉德拉贝（Walad Rabei ’ ） 与她的丈夫以及十岁的女儿在就医返回途中被杀？
As Moqbel Abdullah Ali al-Jarraah, a villager from Silat al-Jarraah, put it: “I believe that America is testing its lethal inventions in our poor villages, because [it] cannot afford to do so at any place where human life has value. Here, we are without value.”	他们如何知道阿卜杜赫·穆罕默德·贾拉哈（Abdoh Mohammed al-Jarraah）在希拉特贾拉哈（Silat al-Jarraah）的房子被无人机打击夷为平地时里面有19人，包括妇女和儿童？
In every incident recorded in this report, the families of Yemeni civilians killed in US strikes want to know why they were targeted.	但是，尽管美国政府一直对无人机袭击保持沉默在国内或许有帮助，但在也门和其他地区，这释放了一个危险信号。
As the father of Nasser Mohammed Nasser, one of four innocent civilians killed in a US drone strike on April 19, 2014, lamented: “My son and those who were with him had nothing to do with Al Qaeda. They were simply on their way to earn a living.	希拉特贾拉哈的一位村民莫贝尔·阿卜杜拉·阿里·贾拉哈（Moqbel Abdullah Ali al-Jarraah）说 ： “ 我认为美国拿我们贫穷村庄试验它的致命发明，因为它不能在其他任何人命很值钱的地方进行试验。
Why, then, did the American aircraft strike them?”	在这里，我们的命毫无价值 。 ”
But the US has given Nasser no answers.	2013年2月，时任白宫反恐首席官员的约翰·布伦南（John Brennan）在其赴任重要情报局局长的审核听证会上说 ： “ 为了��明度 ， ” 美国必须公开承认误杀。 当月晚些时候，他承认美国政府“应该公开因为美国针对基地组织的打击而丧生的平民总数 。 ”
It has not even acknowledged that it killed his son.	但这两件事美国一件也没有做。
In February 2013, then-White House counterterrorism chief John Brennan testified at his Senate confirmation hearing to become CIA Director that, “in the interest of transparency,” the US must acknowledge mistaken killings publicly.	因此，对于像纳赛尔那样在美国袭击中失去了母亲、父亲、儿子和女儿的平民来说，毫不奇怪他们不但对美国怒不可遏，对同意采取无人机打击的也门政府同样怒不可遏。
Later that month, he recognized that the US government “should make public the overall numbers of civilian deaths resulting from US strikes targeting Al Qaeda.” The US has done neither.	从这个角度讲，无人机打击远远没有让也门和美国变得更安全，反倒可能强化对基地组织的支持。
It should come as no surprise, then, that civilians like Nasser, who have lost mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters in US strikes, are outraged not only at the US, but also at the Yemeni government, which consented to the attacks.	今年早些时候，美国宣布了新的无人机出口政策，据称这是为了与其他国家合作为无人机的使用“制定国际标准”并约束无人机进口国“根据国际法使用无人机系统 。 ”
They believe that instead of making Yemen and the US safer, drone strikes only strengthen support for Al Qaeda.	但是 ， 《 死于无人机》指出，美国本身也没有遵守国际法，甚至连它自己的指引也不遵守。
Earlier this year, the US announced a new policy for drone exports, purportedly part of a broader effort to work with other countries to “shape international standards” on the use of drones and compel recipient states “to use these systems in accordance with international law.”	如今，美国仍然拒绝承认无人机计划对平民百姓造成的影响。
But, as “Death by Drone” shows, the US drone program is fundamentally flawed and should not be perpetuated. The Obama administration’s recent admissions that its drone strikes killed its own citizens only underscore this fact.	但是，它们至少绝不应该向其他国家出口它在也门所使用的保密的、有可能是非法的无人机武器模型。
	
Can Yemen Be Saved?	也门还有救吗？
SANA'A – Yemen is no stranger to crisis.	萨那—也门对冲突绝不陌生。
Exposed to a regional proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia, plagued by an entrenched Al Qaeda affiliate, and divided by tribal disputes and a secession movement, the country has become a poster child for everything that can go wrong in the Arab world.	也门暴露在伊朗和沙特阿拉伯的地区代理战争中，饱受根深蒂固的基地组织折磨，也因为部落纠纷和独立运动而分裂。 阿拉伯世界中的所有问题，你都可以在也门找到。
Yemen has demonstrated remarkable resiliency in the past.	在过去，也门表现出引人注目的恢复力。
To ensure that the recent overthrow of its government by the Shia Houthi rebel movement does not deal Yemen the lethal blow that it has avoided so far, the international community must not abandon the country in what may be its hour of greatest need.	为了确保最近什叶派胡塞（Shia Houthi）反抗运动颠覆政府不会给也门造成其到目前为止成功避免了的致命一击，国际社会绝不能再也门最需要的时候放弃这个国家。
The origins of the Houthi movement date to 1991, when it was created to protect Zaydism, a moderate form of Shi'ism, from the encroachment of Sunni Islamists.	胡塞运动的起源可以追溯到1991年。 这一年，胡塞运动成立，初衷是保护什叶派伊斯兰教的温和形势斋德主义（Zaydism）不受逊尼派伊斯兰教迫害。
After the attacks on New York and Washington, DC, on September 11, 2001, the group's battle took on a geopolitical dimension, as its fighters objected to Yemen's decision to collaborate with the United States and enhance bilateral intelligence cooperation.	2001年9月11日纽约和华盛顿恐怖袭击发生后，该组织的战斗又增加了地缘政治维度，其战士拒绝也门与美国采取联合行动和加强双边情报合作的决定。
From 2004 to 2010, the group fought six wars against the Yemeni government and even skirmished with Saudi Arabia.	从2004到2010年，该集团与也门政府打了六场战争，甚至与沙特阿拉伯也产生过摩擦。
Yet it never managed to expand its reach beyond its stronghold in the north of the country.	但它从未成功将势力范围推广到其牢牢掌握的也门北部以外。
That changed in 2011, when the popular protests and political chaos stemming from the Arab Spring led to widespread institutional paralysis, allowing the Houthis to march past a military that largely refused to fight it.	2011年，形势发生了变化，阿拉伯之春所导致的群众游行和政治混乱引起了普遍的制度瘫痪，军队拒绝与胡塞运动分子作战。
The group's power grab has frightened its adversaries, leading them to seek new alliances that could imperil the state's security.	该集团的得势令其对手大感恐惧，促使它们结成新的联盟，以至于危及国家安全。
In the central region of Marib, home to the oil and gas facilities that Yemen relies on for foreign currency, several tribes have vowed to fight the Houthis.	在马利布（Marib，作为也门主要外汇来源的油气设施所在地）地区，多个部落都宣誓与胡塞运动斗争到底。
The region was once a stronghold of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), an affiliate of the global terrorist organization.	该地区曾为阿拉伯半岛基地组织（AQAP，基地组织的分支）所牢固掌握。
If the military refuses to assist the tribes – as is likely – they may be tempted to turn to AQAP.	如果军队拒绝帮助部落 — — 很有可能如此 — — 它们就有可能倒向AQAP。
The situation is no less precarious in the southern provinces, where a secession movement has been active since 2007.	南部省份的情况尤其恶劣。 也门南部的分裂运动在2007年便已十分活跃。
Southerners are up in arms because the Houthi rebellion halted plans for the adoption of a federal system, which would have given the region greater autonomy.	南方人之所以武装起来，是因为胡塞叛军中止了采取联邦制的计划，而联邦制将带给南部更大的自治权。
In response, armed groups seized checkpoints and closed the port of Aden.	结果，武装集团占领了检查站，关闭了亚丁港。
The risk of secession is very real.	分裂的风险是实实在在的。
Southern Sunnis have been marginalized since a 1994 civil war that left northerners in control of most of the country's political institutions.	1994年的内战让北方人控制了也门的大部分政治机构，此后，南方的逊尼派就一直被边缘化。
Many in the region worry that the Houthis will discriminate against them further.	该地区的许多人担心胡塞运动分子会更加歧视他们。
AQAP is firmly rooted in this region as well, implying the possibility that local residents will seek its help in defending against an expected Houthi onslaught.	AQAP也在该地区根基深厚，这意味着当地居民可能寻求AQAP的帮助以抵抗预料中的胡塞运动突击。
Meanwhile, Yemen continues to serve as a battleground in a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia.	与此同时，也门依然是伊朗和沙特阿拉伯之间的代理战争的战场。
Iran has armed and trained the Houthis, and, though the rebels' brand of Shi'ism shares little with that practiced in Tehran, they have praised the Islamic Republic's founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and held up Iran's Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah, as a model to be emulated.	伊朗武装并训练了胡塞运动，而尽管叛军的什叶派伊斯兰幌子与德黑兰的什叶派伊斯兰几乎没有共同之处，但他们歌颂伊朗伊斯兰共和国创始人霍梅尼，也支持其模仿对象、伊朗的黎巴嫩代理人真主党。
When the Houthis took over Sana'a, the capital, in September, Saudi Arabia cut off aid to the country.	9月，当胡塞运动占领首都萨那时，沙特阿拉伯切断了对也门的援助。
To make matters worse, falling oil prices and attacks on pipelines imperil a hydrocarbon industry that provides 63% of government revenues.	更糟糕的是，油价下跌和对油管的袭击令石化行业岌岌可危，而石化行业贡献了也门63%的政府收入。
Decreased earnings led Yemen to forecast a $3.2 billion budget deficit last year.	下降的收入导致也门去年预算赤字预计高达21亿美元。
If the turmoil is not curtailed and the Saudis do not resume the payments that have long ensured the country's ability to function, Yemen may not be able to cover its expenditures.	如果动荡得不到遏制，并且沙特不重新开启长期以来作为也门正常运转保证的转移支付，也门可能无法筹得资金。
The US has followed Saudi Arabia's lead, shuttering its embassy and freezing intelligence cooperation and counterterrorism operations.	美国也步了沙特阿拉伯后尘，关闭了大使馆、冻结了情报合作和反恐行动。
This is a mistake.	这是错误的。
Yemen's military is largely intact, having remained in its barracks as the Houthis marched to the capital, and there is little evidence that the units that work with the Americans are loyal to the new rebel government.	也门军队可以说毫无作为，在胡塞叛军兵临首都时仍然呆在军营里，也没有迹象表明与美国人合作的单位会忠于新的叛军政府。
Suspending cooperation risks giving AQAP free rein in a country where it was able to wreak havoc even when bridled.	中止合作有可能让AQAP主宰也门 — — 要知道，即使在饱受遏制时，AQAP也能在也门呼风唤雨。
Yemen is mired in crises that it cannot solve alone.	也门陷入了它无法独力应对的危机中。
Unless its international allies throw it a lifeline, it risks being swallowed by a sea of disorder that could imperil the entire region.	除非国际盟友伸出救命之手，否则也门可能会被无须吞没，整个地区也将岌岌可危。
	
Yemen’s Regime Change Gets Personal	沦为私人事务的也门政权更替
SANAA – When Yemen’s President Ali Abdullah Saleh ordered his military on March 18 to fire on peaceful protesters calling for his resignation, he sealed his fate.	发自也门首都萨那 — — 从也门总统阿里·阿卜杜拉·萨利赫在3月18日命令部队向要求他下台的和平示威者开枪的那一刻起，他就已经注定走向末路了。
A wave of military, government, and diplomatic defections, led by his long-time ally First Armored Brigade Commander General Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, rocked his regime.	以他的长期盟友，精锐部队第一装甲师师长阿里·穆赫辛·阿赫玛尔将军为首的一众军队，政府和外交官员纷纷倒戈，使其统治当即陷入危机之中。
But, although al-Ahmar announced that he was appalled by the use of force and vowed to defend the constitution, his decision was anything but altruistic.	虽然阿赫玛尔将军声称对总统使用武力的决定深表震惊并呼吁保卫宪政，他的这一决定却肯定是别有用心的。
The disgruntled general, who has long-standing ties to the type of jihadists that the United States is battling in Yemen, merely sought to settle a score with the president’s family.	这位将军长期与美国在也门频繁打击的伊斯兰圣战分子过往甚密，同时也早已对总统本人心怀不满，而他本次的举动仅仅是要跟总统家族划清界限而已。
The relationship between al-Ahmar and Saleh extends to their youth, with Saleh’s mother having had a second marriage to al-Ahmar’s uncle.	阿赫玛尔和萨利赫的关系可以追溯到他们的青年时代，当年萨利赫的母亲改嫁给了阿赫玛尔的叔叔。
Though they are not half-brothers, this frequent, if mistaken reference, indicates their closeness.	虽然两人并无血缘关系，但这一频繁的交往（如果没错的话）也显示出两人关系非同一般。
Al-Ahmar has long been considered either Saleh’s right hand man or the country’s hidden president.	阿赫玛尔一直以来都被视为萨利赫的左右手及也门的幕后总统。
When the Nasserite party attempted to overthrow Saleh less than 100 days into his presidency, al-Ahmar defended him and quashed the coup.	当也门的纳塞尔主义党试图在萨利赫就任总统还不到100天的时候推翻他时，是阿赫玛尔站出来保护他并挫败了那场政变。
In 1994, his units put down a secessionist movement in the south.	在随后的1994年，阿赫玛尔的部队又在也门南部地区镇压了一场分离主义运动。
But, as Saleh prepared the way for his son Ahmad – the head of the Presidential Guard – to succeed him, he began to marginalize al-Ahmar.	但当萨利赫决定将总统职位交由其子阿赫玛德（现任总统卫队队长）继承之后，他就开始逐步将阿赫玛尔边缘化。
In 2009, Saleh sacked al-Ahmar’s key backers, including Central Command Chief General al-Thahiri al-Shadadi and Lieutenant General Haydar al-Sanhani, from power.	在2009年，萨利赫分别解除了阿赫玛尔的重要支持者，中央司令部司令塔希里·萨达迪将军以及海耶尔·萨哈尼中将的职务。
Al-Ahmar has also not benefited from the military aid that the US lavished on Yemen in the wake of al-Qaeda’s failed Christmas Day plot in 2009 to down an American airliner.	同时阿赫玛尔也没有从美国向也门提供的大规模军事援助（起因是基地组织于2009年圣诞针对一架美国客机的未遂袭击）中捞到任何好处。
While the Central Security Service, led by Saleh’s nephew Yahya, has received millions of dollars to fight al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, al-Ahmar has been left out of the economic bonanza.	当由萨利赫的侄子雅赫亚领导的也门中央情报机构坐收美国数百万美元打击阿拉伯半岛基地组织经费时，阿赫玛尔却只能眼睁睁地看着前者大发其财。
At the same time, al-Ahmar’s dismal performance in spearheading the war against the Houthi-led sectarian rebellion in the north made him a convenient scapegoat for the regime’s failures.	与此同时，阿赫玛尔在北部打击以胡锡为首的宗教反抗势力时的作战不力又使他经常被用作掩饰该政权种种弊端的替罪羊。
The regime’s desire to get al-Ahmar out of the picture became clear during the last round of fighting aginst the Houthis in 2009-2010, when Saudi Arabia began bombing the rebels. According to a US diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks, Yemeni officials gave the Saudis the coordinates for al-Ahmar’s command center, telling them that it was a Houthi camp.	萨利赫政权试图将阿赫玛尔逐出最高权力的意图在2009-2010年的上一轮对胡锡分子作战行动中昭然若揭：根据维基解密网站所披露出来的美国外交电报，当沙特开始轰炸暴乱分子的时候，也门官员竟然向沙特方面提供了阿赫玛尔指挥部的坐标，并宣称那是一处胡锡暴乱分子的营地。
His relationship with Saleh frayed and his influence waning, al-Ahmar understood that his loyalty to Saleh had become a liability.	眼看着自己与萨利赫的关系逐渐恶化而自身的影响力日渐衰微，阿赫玛尔意识到自己对萨利赫的忠诚已经成为了一种负担。
So his decision to abandon Saleh stemmed less from his love of the constitution and democracy than from his desire to even the score with the president and his son Ahmad Saleh, with whom he has long clashed.	因此他抛弃萨利赫的决定与其说是出于对宪法和民主的爱戴，不如说是为了与总统以及其子阿赫玛德·萨利赫（此人与阿赫玛尔也经常发生冲突）算账。
Their units skirmished during the Houthi campaign, and the two engaged in a power struggle over defense of the radio and television stations.	这两人所掌握的部队在镇压胡锡暴动期间已经发生过小规模冲突，并卷入了争夺广播电台和电视台的权力斗争中。
Saleh won at the time, but today al-Ahmar’s troops have control.	当时萨利赫赢得了胜利，如今阿赫玛尔又成为了赢家。
Al-Ahmar’s relationship with jihadists is a source of serious concern.	阿赫玛尔与伊斯兰圣战分子之间的关系总会引起极大的关注。
He is married to the sister of Tariq al-Fadhli, a Yemeni who fought alongside al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Ladin in Afghanistan.	他的妻子就是基地组织领导人奥萨马·本·拉登在阿富汗的战友塔里克·法赫里的姐妹。
When more than 4,000 Arabs returned from fighting the Soviets there, al-Ahmar organized them into units and deployed them in the 1994 civil war.	当4000多名阿拉伯人结束在阿富汗的抗苏战斗后，阿赫玛尔又将他们组织起来投入到了1994年的内战中。
One jihadist who trained in al-Qaeda’s camps, and met bin Ladin, told me that upon his return from Afghanistan, he was invited to meet al-Ahmar’s associates and was given a monthly stipend.	一名曾在基地组织训练营受训并见过本·拉登的圣战分子告诉我，当他从阿富汗回到也门后就被阿赫玛尔招致麾下并按月发给工资。
During a 1999 trial of Yemenis convicted of kidnapping 16 Europeans, it emerged that the group’s ringleader called al-Ahmar during the ordeal.	在1999年对绑架16名欧洲人的也门人进行审判时，证据显示该团伙的头目在绑架过程中曾经致电阿赫玛尔。
Though his ties to jihadists may be expedient rather than ideological, they are deeply worrying.	而虽然阿赫玛尔与圣战分子的联系主要是策略上的而非意识形态上的，但这也足以令外界忧心不已了。
Today, Saleh’s support among his top generals is dwindling.	如今，萨利赫在高级军官中的支持度已经江河日下。
Of Yemen’s four regional commanders, only Southern Command Chief General Mahdi Maqwala still backs him.	也门的4大军区指挥官中只有南部军区司令马赫迪·马克瓦拉将军依旧支持他。
Lesser lieutenant generals have deserted the president in droves.	更低级的中将们则大批倒向了总统的对立面。
The fate of the country may not hinge on Saleh, a crafty veteran who knows that his career is over.	这个国家的命运已经不再由萨利赫决定，而这个��猾的政治老手也知道自己的政治生涯已经终结。
But his son Ahmad, who is less politically astute, may yet seek to settle accounts with al-Ahmar.	但他的儿子，在政治上还不那么成熟的阿赫玛德，可能还会试图与阿赫玛尔达成交易。
His forces have already clashed with rival units in Mukalla and surrounded the presidential palace in Aden.	阿赫玛尔的部队已经与位于木卡拉的敌对部队交火并包围了位于亚丁的总统官邸。
If the Salehs retain control of the air force, which remains under the control of Saleh’s half-brother, employing it against defecting military divisions would likely lead to a bloodbath.	如果萨利赫家族还维持着对空军的控制力 — — 指挥权目前还在萨利赫的另一个兄弟手里 — — 并利用其对反对派部队发动进攻的话，那么结果将是一场血战。
Nevertheless, the doomsday scenarios predicting anarchy and chaos in the post-Saleh era are most likely exaggerated.	此外，人们想象中的那种后萨利赫时代的政治乱局和社会动荡的末日景象可能也过于夸张了。
Unlike in Egypt, the vacuum resulting from Saleh’s departure can be quickly filled, so the country need not fall back on a military oligarchy.	跟埃及不同，萨利赫下台所导致的权力真空将很快被填补，因此也门也不太可能会退回到军政府独裁的年代。
The Yemeni opposition is not only organized, but also plays an active role in politics and has true grassroots support.	也门反对派不但极有组织，而且在政治方面也扮演着积极角色，同时又确实拥有草根民众的支持。
And, unlike in Egypt, where the ruling party was detested and out of touch with the masses, Yemen’s General People’s Congress has some following in society. If Saleh leaves peacefully and represses the urge to unleash the last remaining loyal army units against protesters and defecting soldiers, the country can avert Libya-like mayhem.	同时也门执政党全国人民大会党并不像埃及执政党那样遭人痛恨并且脱离群众，相反该党在社会上依然拥有一批追随者，如果萨利赫能和平下台并解散余下的那些镇压示威者和反抗部队的武装力量，也门就可以避免出现像利比亚那样的大混乱。
Indeed, the opposition parties have already organized a transitional council to take Saleh’s place.	事实上，各反对党已经组织了一个过渡委员会以接替萨利赫的位置。
With the sun quickly setting on the Saleh era, the president is out of options.	当萨利赫时代迅速落幕之时，总统本人已没有任何回旋余地。
The only decision before him and his thinning ranks of allies is whether to leave peacefully or go down fighting.	摆在他及其不断萎缩的盟友面前的只有两个选择：要么和平地离开，要么还是继续顽抗下去。
	
Japan vs. the Currency Speculators	日本 vs. 货币投机者
TOKYO – With Japan’s economy struggling to escape its deflationary torpor, the economic-revitalization plan that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe launched in 2012 has come under growing scrutiny.	东京—日本经济正在竭力摆脱通缩麻木，首相安倍晋三在2012年推出的经济振兴计划也受到越来越多的审视。
But Japan’s current travails, which have brought a concomitant decline in Japan’s stock market, stem from the yen’s appreciation – 24% over the last year – against major currencies.	但日本当前的艰苦来自日元兑其他主要货币的升值 — — 去年升值幅度达到了24 % ， 并导致日本股市也随之下跌。
“Abenomics” – which included substantial monetary and fiscal expansion – has nothing to do with it.	包括大规模货币和财政扩张的“安倍经济学”与此毫无干系。
Since Abenomics was introduced, Japan’s labor market has improved considerably: 1.5 million new jobs have been created, and the unemployment rate has fallen to just over 3%.	自安倍经济学实施以来，日本劳动力市场显著改善：新创150万工作岗位，失业率下跌至略高于3 % 。
Moreover, corporate profits have soared, and tax revenues have increased by more than ‎¥20 trillion ($188 billion).	此外，公司利润大幅增长，税收收入增加了20万亿多日元。
To build on these gains, Japan has promised a large fiscal expansion next month, which some describe as a piecemeal, temporary version of so-called “helicopter drops” (permanent monetization of government debt).	为了在此基础上更进一步，日本承诺下个月开始大规模财政扩张，有人称之为零散性、暂时性“直升机撒钱 ” （ 政府债务永久货币化 ） 。
But there is concern that it will not be enough, if the yen continues to appreciate.	但有人担心这还不够，如果日元继续升值的话。
To be sure, expansionary policies, particularly monetary policies – a pillar of Abenomics – could contribute to currency depreciation.	诚然，扩张性政策，个别是货币政策 — — 安倍经济学的一大支柱 — — 可以带来货币贬值。
But the US Federal Reserve’s dovish approach to exiting its own quantitative-easing program, together with expansionary policies in other major economies, has weakened their impact on the exchange rate.	但美联储对于退出量化宽松的鸽派立场，以及其他主要经济体的扩张性政策，削弱了其对汇率的影响。
More recently, the United Kingdom’s vote to “Brexit” the European Union, together with the introduction of negative rates by multiple central banks, including the Bank of Japan (BOJ), shook markets.	最近，英国投票“脱离”欧盟，在加上多家央行（包括日本银行）引入了负利率，对市场形成了冲击。
Taking advantage of this nervousness, hedge-fund managers and other speculators have increasingly been betting on the yen’s appreciation; indeed, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange shows substantial interest in the yen futures market.	利用这一紧张情绪，对冲基金经理和其他投机者越来越多地下注于日元升值；事实上，芝加哥商业交易所（CME）对日元期货市场持仓量巨大。
In a flexible exchange-rate system, each country conducts monetary policy independently, based on domestic objectives, and accepts the resulting exchange rate.	在浮动汇率制度中，一国基于国内目标独立制定货币政策，并接受汇率结果。
But when exchange-rate movements become sharp or erratic, monetary authorities have the authority – even the obligation – to intervene to smooth them out.	但当汇率波动变得剧烈或反覆时，货币当局有权 — — 甚至有义务 — — 出手干预，平息波动。
The Japanese authorities seem to recognize this, in theory.	日本当局似乎认识到了这一点 — — 在理论上。
On August 18, officials from the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Financial Services Agency, and the BOJ gathered to discuss what can be done to stem the yen’s appreciation.	8月18日，日本财务省、金融厅和日本银行开会讨论如何阻止日元升值。
After the meeting, Masatsugu Asakawa, the deputy minister of finance for international affairs, declared that the MOF would act swiftly against exchange-rate movements deemed to be speculative.	会后，负责国际事务的副财务大臣浅川雅嗣（Masatsugu Asakawa）宣布财务省将在认定出现投机性汇率波动时迅速出手阻止。
The announcement was supposed to cause speculators to shake in their boots.	此番宣告是为了敲山震虎。
Yet markets moved only slightly, within a range of a couple of yen to the dollar.	但市场对此反应平淡，日元兑美元只波动了几个点位。
After all, the MOF has made such threats before – for example, just after the introduction of the BOJ’s negative interest-rate policy, and again after the Brexit decision – but never followed through.	毕竟，财务省此前也发布过此类威胁 — — 比如在日本央行引入负利率政策之后，以及英国退出之后 — — 但从未执行。
Like Aesop’s boy who cried wolf, the MOF has lost credibility, at least when it comes to the threat of intervention in currency markets.	就像“狼来了”的故事，财务省信誉尽失，至少在干预货币市场的威胁方面是如此。
So speculators remain convinced that they are making a one-way bet – win big or break even – and continue to push the yen higher.	因此，投机者仍然心安理得地单边押注 — — 要么大赚，要么打平手 — — 继续推高日元。
At this point, the MOF’s words will not be enough to deter speculation.	眼下，财务省的话已不足以震慑投机。
But the MOF remains hesitant to back its tough talk with action, not least because of American disapproval of supposed “currency manipulation.”	但财务省仍然犹犹豫豫，不兑现严厉的威胁，因为美国反对所谓的“货币操纵 ” 。
High-level officials at the US Treasury and Federal Reserve actively try to dissuade advocacy of direct intervention, including by me.	美国财政部和美联储高官积极地试图劝阻直接干预的支持者，包括我。
An American scholar reacted angrily when I merely mentioned the word, as if it were an obscenity.	我只是提到了这个词，就遭到一位美国学者的愤怒反驳，好像我在说什么淫词秽语似的。
American officials, for their part, emphasize that if Japan can be accused of manipulating currency markets, the US Congress will not approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).	而美国官员强调，如果日本涉嫌操纵货币市场，美国国会就不会批准跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（TPP ） 。
It is possible that the MOF will choose to keep the US on its side, and continue to offer only empty threats to speculators.	有可能财务省将选择站在美国一边，继续对投机者进行空头威胁。
Or it may simply vacillate until it is too late to take real action.	或者它将继续摇摆，直到错失动真格的时机。
Either approach may well produce the same disastrous result: allowing the yen to appreciate to damaging levels and causing Abenomics to fail.	不论哪种方法，都将导致同样的灾难：日元升值到危险水平，使安倍经济学失败。
What the MOF should do is intervene courageously in currency markets to stem the yen’s appreciation.	财务省应该做的是勇敢地干预货币市场，阻止日元升值。
Speculators will learn a tough lesson, and Japan’s economy could get back on track.	投机者将得到痛苦的教训，日本经济也可以重回正轨。
Though Japan may become a scapegoat for the failure of the TPP, it seems unlikely that the deal would be ratified in any case, given the current political climate in the United States.	尽管日本可能因此成为TPP失败的替罪羊，但从当前美国政治气候看，该协议本来获得批准的希望就十分渺茫。
An alternative would be for the BOJ to purchase foreign securities.	一个替代方案是日本银行购买外国证券。
Many hedge-fund managers, along with some economists, claim that the key to saving Japan’s economy from deflation is a more direct helicopter drop, with newly printed cash delivered directly to consumers.	许多对冲基金经理，以及以及一些经济学家，认为拯救日本经济于通缩的关键是更直接的直升机撒钱，将新印出来的现金直接给消费者。
Yet these same people are impeding effective macroeconomic policy, by betting on the yen’s appreciation.	但正是这批人通过押注日元升值阻止宏观经济政策生效。
Only when the speculators are brought to heel should such a bold – and highly risky – monetary policy even be up for discussion.	唯有将投机者“斩于马下 ” ， 这一大胆 — — 并且高风险 — — 的货币政策才值得讨论。
	
Women’s Development Goals	妇女的发展目标
NEW YORK – As the 2015 deadline for the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) approaches, world leaders will face a choice: move the goal posts back another decade or two, or hold accountable those who have failed to deliver on their commitments.	纽约—随着2015年联合国千年发展目标（Millennium Development Goals）截止期的临近，世界领导人面临一个选择：将目标再往后延十年或二十年，或者问责没能实现承诺者。
For women, the choice is clear.	对妇女来说，选择是明确的。
We have been here before.	我们曾经走到过这一步。
In 1978, at the International Conference on Primary Health Care in Alma-Ata, 134 states signed a declaration calling for adequate health care for all by the year 2000.	1978年，在阿拉木图举行的国际初级医疗会议（International Conference on Primary Health Care）上，134个国家签署了一份宣言，要求到2000年让所有人都得到充足的医疗 。 。
Sixteen years later, in 1994, in Cairo, 179 governments embraced reproductive rights as a basic human right and adopted resolutions to ensure the provision of universal access to a full range of reproductive health services, including family planning.	十六年后，1994年，在埃及，179个政府将生殖权利列为基本人权，并通过了确保所有人都能活全方位生育卫生服务（包括计划生育）的决议。
Yet those deadlines had come and gone when, in September 2000, during the 55th UN General Assembly, leaders of 189 nations adopted the MDGs.	但2000年9月，在第55界联合国大会上，189个国家的领导人启动了千年发展计划，这些截止期也就无疾而终了。
And several other commitments and resolutions were undertaken by world leaders before and after the MDG declaration.	世界领导人在千年发展目标宣言前后还接手了其他一些承诺和决议。
So, where are we now?	那么，现在怎么样了呢？
We know that several MDG targets have already been met.	我们知道，一些千年发展目标已经实现了。
Extreme poverty has been more than halved since 2000, to about 22% in 2010 – taking almost 700 million people out of the ranks of the world’s poorest.	自2000年以来，极端贫困减少了一大半，在2010年时只剩下大约22 % — —近7亿人被带出了全球最贫困行列。
We have seen positive results in the fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.	与艾滋病、疟疾和结核病的斗争也取得了积极的成果。
Billions of people have access to improved drinking water; and many have gained access to sanitation (though a billion people still have to resort to open defecation – a major health risk).	数十亿人获得了改善的饮用水；许多人拥有了卫生间（尽管仍有十亿人需要在旱厕解手，这是一个重大健康风险 ） 。
There has also been progress on gender equality.	在性别平等方面也取得了进步。
Girls and boys attend school in equal numbers, and women are increasingly making themselves heard in the political arena.	在校女生和男生数量已基本持平，政治竞技场上也有更多的妇女崭露头角。
But the picture quickly becomes cloudy.	但好景不长。
Though chronic under-nutrition among young children has declined, one in four children – 162 million children, according to the World Health Organization – are still affected by stunting.	尽管幼儿长期营养不良的情况有所缓解，但每四个儿童中就有一个 — — 根据世界卫生组织的数据，即1.62亿儿童 — — 仍然发育迟缓。
Indeed, maternal and child mortality has decreased by millions, but many of these preventable deaths are still claiming the lives of hundreds of thousands of women and children each year.	事实上，母亲和儿童死亡率减少了数百万，但这类可预防死亡每年仍要夺走数十万妇女和儿童的生命。
Moreover, the UN Foundation reports that 222 million women still cannot access the most basic information, products, and services that would enable them to decide how many children to have and to time their pregnancies in ways that preserve their health, enable them to pursue an education, and improve their lives.	此外，联合国基金会报告，仍有2.22亿妇女得不到最基本的信息、产品和服务来科学地决定生几个孩子、计算孕期以保证健康，或追求教育改善生活。
The same report notes that more than 300,000 girls and women aged 15-19 die every year from pregnancy-related complications, while many more are left to deal with debilitating disabilities.	同一报告还指出，每年有超过30万15—19岁女孩和妇女死于与妊娠有关的状况，更多妇女和女孩因衰竭而致残。
The UN secretary-general’s 2013 report “A Life of Dignity for All” calls for a universal agenda to ensure that no one is left behind. But millions of people – and particularly women – already are being left behind.	联合国秘书长2013年的报告《所有人的生命尊严 》 （ A Life of Dignity for All）要求成立全球日程确保不会将任何人遗漏。
And, because world leaders and their development partners have failed to meet women’s basic reproductive-health needs once again, it will be more difficult to achieve concrete progress toward realizing the agenda for sustainable development.	此外，由于世界领导人及其发展伙伴再一次没能满足妇女的基本生育健康需要，在实现可持续发展日程方面取得切实进展变得更加困难了。
The UN’s own calls to accelerate momentum at the launch of the 500-day countdown to the MDGs’ expiry highlight the fact that inequality, maternal mortality from childbirth, lack of universal education, and environmental degradation remain serious challenges.	联合国在千年发展目标截止期倒计时500天时呼吁增加动力，这凸显出一个事实，即不平等性、产妇分娩死亡率、缺乏义务教育以及环境恶化仍是严重挑战。
To truly affect change – and not only for women – we need global support for access to family planning, women’s and children’s health services, and support for empowerment initiatives.	为了有效影响变化 — — 不仅仅是为了妇女 — — 我们需要对计划生育的支持、妇女和儿童卫生服务以及对赋权项目的支持。
An educated woman is better able to take care of herself, make informed choices, and broaden her contribution to her community.	受过教育的妇女能更好地照顾好自己，做出信息充分的选择，并增加自己对社区的贡献。
When we leave women behind, we leave their communities behind, too.	如果我们不顾妇女，她们也无法顾及社会。
No one disputes that development must be inclusive and equitable.	没有人质疑发展必须是包容平等的。
What is missing from the diplomatic discourse is a strong framework to hold governments and development partners accountable for translating lofty ideals like human rights – particularly the right to access basic health and social services – into practical solutions.	这一外交辞令所忽视的是能够问责政府和发展合作伙伴在将人权 — — 特别是获得基本卫生和社会服务的权利 — — 的美好理想转变为现实解决方案方面的责任的强大框架。
As the post-2015 sustainable development agenda is drafted, world leaders and their development partners need to think beyond setting new goals or targets that fade with time, and move toward establishing accountability mechanisms, processes, and systems to ensure that we meet the goals that we have already set.	2015年后的可持续发展日程已经起草，世界领导人及其发展合作伙伴的眼光应该超越订立随时间消逝的目标（goals and targets ） ， 而转向建立问责机制、程序和制度以确保我们能够实现已经订立的目标。
We must break away from the current unwritten code of “zero accountability” for leaders who fail to honor their own commitments to internationally agreed goals.	我们必须与当前不成文的“零责任”规矩决裂，不尊重自己许下的对国际一致目标的承诺的领导人必须承担责任。
In short, our governments must begin to do what they have promised.	简言之，我们的政府必须开始做它们承诺做的事。
Without strong accountability mechanisms, ending preventable maternal deaths and fostering sustainable and equitable development will continue to elude us as we move into increasingly perilous times.	没有强大的问责机制，结束可预防的产妇死亡、铸就可持续的平等的发展就不会在我们进入日益危险的时代时与我们同在。
	
Asia’s Military Revolution	亚洲军事革命
SEOUL – A vast revolution in military affairs is taking place across East Asia.	首尔—一场军事事务大革命正在东亚展开。
The latest signs are Chinese President Xi Jinping’s purge of General Xu Caihou, an ex-Politburo member and former vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, on charges of corruption, and Japan’s “reinterpretation” of Article 9 of its constitution to permit the country to provide military aid to its allies.	最新信号包括中国国家主席习近平以腐败罪名清洗前政治局委员、中央军委副主席徐才厚上将，以及日本“重新解释”其宪法第九条，允许日本为盟国提供军事援助。
Despite the rising regional tensions that inspired these moves, China’s relations with its neighbors and the United States are not fated to lead to direct confrontation.	尽管升级的地区紧张局势刺激了这些动作，但中国与邻国和美国的关系并未恶化到产生直接冲突的程度。
But the relentless march of new initiatives to meet the perceived “China threat” will require the region’s political leaders, including the Chinese, to address their disputes in new and more creative ways if that outcome is to be avoided.	但不断地采取新措施以至于产生“中国威胁”论需要地区政治领导人（包括中国）用更新、更有创造力的方式解决争端，否则难以避免直接冲突。
In general, there are three ways to foster international peace: deepening economic interdependence, promoting democracy, and building international institutions.	总体而言，有三种方式构建国际和平：深化经济相互依存、推进民主，以及建立国际机构。
Unfortunately, because East Asia’s political leaders have failed to pursue the latter objective, they now find themselves playing dangerous balance-of-power games reminiscent of Europe a century ago.	不幸的是，由于东亚政治领导人在最后一个目标上已经失败，因此现在已经陷入了与一个世界前的欧洲十分相似的危险的实力平衡博弈。
Deepening economic interdependence in the wake of Asia’s 1997 financial crisis has not generated political momentum for peace and cooperation.	1997年亚洲金融危机所带来的经济相互依存深化并未产生和平与合作的政治动力。
The region’s business leaders have been unable to prevent deteriorating foreign relations from harming their interests.	东亚商业领袖一直无法避免外交关系恶化影响自身利益。
By contrast, military lobbying now deeply influences foreign and defense policies – witness China’s double-digit increase in defense spending and rising US arms sales in the region.	相反，军事游说目前深刻地影响着外交和国防政策 — — 中国以两位数增长的国防支出和节节攀升的美国东亚地区军售就是明证。
What explains this failure?	这一失败的原因何在？
International-relations theorists since Immanuel Kant have held that democracies rarely (if ever) fight one another; as a result, political leaders, such as US President Woodrow Wilson, have tried to promote democracy as a means to spread peace.	自康德以来的国际关系理论家都认为，民主国家间很少互相开战；因此，政治领导人，如美国总统威尔逊，试图通过推进民主作为扩大和平的途径。
Until recently, the US seemed to have assumed that China’s engagement with Western democracies would bolster peaceful ties.	直到最近，美国似乎一直都认为中国加入西方民主阵营能推动和平关系。
But, since the 2008 financial crisis, China’s confidence in its authoritarian development model has grown stronger.	但是，自2008年金融危机以来，中国对其集权发展模式的信心日益高涨。
Its leaders now increasingly appear to believe that a new “Beijing Consensus” of mercantilism and state intervention has replaced the old “Washington Consensus” of free trade and deregulation.	中国领导人现在日益相信，强调重商主义和国家干预的新的“北京共识”已经取代了强调自由贸易和去监管的旧的“华盛顿共识 ” 。
China’s ideological incompatibility with the US thus is making the shift in their relative power difficult to achieve peacefully.	因此，中国与美国的意识形态不相容决定了它们相对实力的变化难以以和平方式实现。
In the late nineteenth century, a rising US was able to cooperate with a declining Britain, owing to their shared culture and values.	19世纪末，崛起的美国能够与衰落的英国合作，这是因为它们有共同的文化和价值。
China’s leaders, however, tend to suspect that the US is deliberately trying to undermine their country’s political stability by questioning its record on human rights and political freedoms.	但是，中国领导人向来怀疑美国在通过质疑中国人权和政治自由状况处心积虑破坏中国的政治稳定。
Meanwhile, Xi’s domestic policies seem to be taking the country ever further from Western norms.	与此同时，习近平的国内政策也让中国与西方范式渐行渐远。
It is this ideological divide that is undermining the development in East Asia of institutions that establish principles, rules, and decision-making procedures for the region.	这一意识形态分歧破坏了东亚的机构建设，导致没有形成制定原则、规则和决策流程的地区机构。
While much of the West is bound together by institutions like the Organization for Security Cooperation in Europe and NATO, East Asia’s main body, the ASEAN Regional Forum, is too weak to play an analogous role, leaving the region beset with unregulated rivalries.	大部分西方国家通过欧安组织和北约等机构而联系在一起，但东亚的主要机构 — — 东盟地区论坛太软弱，无法起到类似的作用，这使得东亚陷入了不受约束的对峙状态。
So far, US and East Asian leaders have done little beyond offering rhetorical support for the creation of multilateral security institutions.	目前，美国和东亚领导人采取的措施无非是口头支持建立多边安全机构。
With the exception of the almost defunct six-party talks aimed at eliminating the nuclear threat posed by North Korea, Asia’s powers refuse to be constrained by international rules or norms.	除了濒死的六方会谈（旨在消除朝鲜带来的核威胁 ） ， 亚洲大国拒绝受到国际规则或范式的约束。
Instead, East Asia’s leaders resort to realpolitik.	相反，东亚领导人转向了现实政治。
Unfortunately, unlike Europe’s nineteenth-century political masterminds – figures like Talleyrand, Metternich, Bismarck, and Disraeli – who crafted durable international alliances, Asia lacks leaders willing and able to look beyond their narrow national interests.	��幸的是，与塔列朗（Talleyrand ） 、 梅特涅（Metternich ） 、 俾斯麦（Bismarck）和迪斯累利（Disraeli）等创造了持久国际联盟的19世纪欧洲政治家不同，亚洲缺少愿意也能够让目光超越狭隘国家利益的领导人。
For example, China’s leaders seem to believe that the 2008 economic crisis and the high costs of two foreign wars have left the US in no position to exercise international leadership.	比如，中国领导人似乎认为2008年经济危机和两场海外战争的巨大代价意味着美国已不再能够行使国际领导力。
That may explain China’s recent foreign-policy assertiveness, particularly in its dispute with Japan over control of the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, which could be intended to probe the strength of the US-Japan alliance.	这或许能够解释中国最近的激进外交政策，特别是在钓鱼岛控制权问题上与日本的争端，这也许是意在探测美日同盟的坚固程度。
Testing US power in this way could prove to be a dangerous miscalculation.	以这种方式试探美国的实力或许是危险的误判。
Though weakened economically, the US remains a military superpower.	尽管经济颓势尽露，美国仍是军事超级大国。
Its interests in East Asia date back to the late nineteenth century.	其对东亚的兴趣可以追溯到19世纪末。
Just as Britain refused to concede naval supremacy to Germany a century ago, the US will not easily accept any Chinese challenge to its strategic position in the western Pacific, especially given that so many East Asian states are pleading for US protection.	正如一个世纪前英国拒绝将海军霸权拱手让给德国，美国也不会轻易接受中国对其西太平洋战略地位的挑战，特别是考虑到大量东亚国家都要仰仗美国的保护。
China and the US need to talk.	中国和美国需要谈判。
Despite their economic interdependence and some 90 inter-governmental channels for bilateral dialogue, the two superpowers are caught in a perilous tug-of-war over interests in the East and South China Seas and the western Pacific.	尽管两国经济需要互相依存，并且两国间存在大约90条政府双边对话渠道，但这两个超级大国在东海和南海以及西太平洋利益上陷入了危险的角力。
Sino-Japanese relations are particularly fraught, with two decades of economic stagnation in Japan and rapid growth in China fueling nationalist overreaction on both sides.	中日关系尤其令人担心，日本二十年的经济停滞和中国二十年的快速增长加剧了双方民族主义热情高企。
Having become accustomed to outsourcing its security to the US, and despite having the world’s third-largest economy, Japan neglected to develop its own constructive diplomatic vision.	日本早已习惯将安全外包给美国，尽管其经济规模位居世界第三，但仍没有发展出其自身的建设性外交愿景。
It remains to be seen whether Abe’s constitutional reinterpretation, cloaked in the language of regional cooperation, advances such a new vision.	安倍披着地区合作外衣的修宪是否标志着日本有了新外教愿景还有待观察。
It does not help that the US wants Japan to shoulder more of the burden of maintaining Asia’s security, a position that may make sense strategically and financially, but that betrays a lack of understanding of the political context.	日本希望日本承担更多的维持亚洲安全的责任，这无济于事，让日本扮演这一角色或许在战略和金融上有意义，但也暴露出缺少对政治环境的理解。
The US seems to underestimate regional concerns over Japan’s potential remilitarization.	美国似乎低估了东亚地区对日本军国主义死灰复燃的担忧。
By providing Japan with a diplomatic carte blanche, the US may find itself hostage to Japanese interests, with the result that Japan becomes part of Asia’s security problem, not part of its solution.	美国可能最终会发现，向日本发放外交委任状让自己站在了日本利益的对立面，其后果将是日本成为亚洲安全问题而不是解决办法的一部分。
Asia-Pacific leaders must shake off their complacency.	亚太领导人必须摆脱自满情绪。
Serious efforts and far-reaching compromises are needed to begin the process of building institutions for regional security cooperation.	要想开启地区安全合作机构的建设，就需要严肃动作和深刻妥协。
Otherwise, the much-heralded “Asian century,” far from bringing economic prosperity and peace, will be an age of suspicion and peril.	否则，近期大热的“亚洲世纪”带来的将绝非经济繁荣与和平，而是怀疑和冒险的时代。
	
The Politics of Young and Old	青年和老人的政治
PARIS – If one considers some of today’s main challenges – including climate change, pensions, public debt, and the labor market – an obvious conclusion emerges: It is relatively much worse to be young today than it was a quarter-century ago.	巴黎 — — 如果深入思考气候变化、养老金、公共债务和劳动力市场等当今世界某些主要挑战，人们可以显而易见地得出结论：今天年轻人的处境远逊于四分之一世纪以前。
Yet in most countries, the generational dimension is remarkably absent from the political debate.	但在多数国家，代际问题却在政治辩论中踪影不见。
Fifty years ago, people spoke often, and loudly, of a “generation gap.”	50年前，人们往往公开谈论“代沟 ” 。
Today, that gap has become invisible.	而今天，人们对代沟问题的讨论却已十分罕见。
This is bad for the young, for democracy, and for social justice.	这对年轻人、民主政体和社会公平而言都不是好现象。
Start with climate change.	先来说气候变化。
Its containment requires changing habits and investing in emission reductions so that future generations will have a habitable planet.	遏制气候变化需要改变习惯、投资减排，以便留给后代一个可以居住的星球。
The alarm bell was first rung in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro; but over the last generation, little was done to contain emissions.	1992年召开的里约热内卢地球峰会首次敲响了警钟；但过去这代人却鲜有减排的举措。
And progress following the landmark agreement achieved in Paris in December is unlikely to be fast, because the accord is premised on postponing major efforts.	而且因为以推迟重大努力为前提，12月巴黎协议达成后也不太可能很快取得进展。
Universal assent was made possible only by further delaying.	达成普遍一致仅仅是因为进一步的拖延。
Given the massive inertia inherent in the greenhouse effect, the gap between responsible and irresponsible behavior will start resulting in different temperatures only in a quarter-century, and major consequences will follow only in 50 years.	鉴于温室效应所固有的巨大惯性，负责和不负责行为所导致的温差将在25年后才得以显现，而产生重大后果则需要50年。
Anyone older than 60 today will hardly notice the difference between the two scenarios.	今天60岁以上的人很可能不会注意到两者之间的差距。
But the fate of most citizens currently younger than 30 will be fundamentally affected.	但多数目前还在30岁以下的民众其命运将会遭到根本性的改变。
In due course, the respite gained by the older generations will have to be paid for by the younger ones.	总有一天，年轻一代将为老一代的喘息之机付出代价。
Now consider debt.	再来说说债务问题。
Since 1990, public debt has increased by about 40 percentage points of GDP in the European Union and the United States (and much more in Japan).	自20世纪90年代以来，欧盟和美国（其实日本更甚）的公共债务占GDP之比提高了约40个百分点。
Given near-zero interest rates, the corresponding drag on income is currently low; but, because inflation is virtually inexistent and growth is anemic, the debt ratios have only stabilized.	鉴于利率接近于零，债务增加目前对收入造成的拖累不大；但因为通胀近乎为零且增长萎靡不振，造成负债率基本稳定下来。
So debt reduction will take longer than expected in the aftermath of the global crisis, which will deprive the coming generations of the fiscal space they might need to invest in climate action or in the containment of security threats.	因此全球危机后需要更长的时间来削减债务，从而剥夺了子孙后代投资气候行动或遏制安全威胁所需的财政空间。
Future pensions represent another form of debt.	未来养老金支出其实是另一种形式的债务。
The pay-as-you-go (PAYG) systems in place in many countries are giant intergenerational transfer schemes.	很多国家实行的现收现付制度都是规模巨大的代际转移方案。
True, everyone is expected to contribute while they work, before becoming a recipient in retirement.	诚然，在成为养老金的领取者之前，每个人在工作期间都会为之做出贡献。
In an ideal steady state, pension regimes would not redistribute income across cohorts born at different points in time.	在理想的稳定状态下，养老金制度不会在不同时间出生的群体间造成收入再分配。
As specialists say, they would be generationally neutral.	正如专家所言，养老制度的代际影响基本为中性。
But the baby boomers (those born from the mid-1940s to the mid-1960s) paid little into the PAYG schemes because economic growth, population size, and their parents’ low life expectancy made financing pensions easy.	但（20世纪40到60年代中期出生的）婴儿潮一代对现收现付制度所做的贡献有限，因为经济增长、人口规模及其父母较低的预期寿命降低了养老金的筹措难度。
All these factors have now gone into reverse: Growth has slowed, the baby boomers are a demographic bulge weighing on their children, and they are expected to live long.	现在一切因素都已经出现了逆转：增长开始放缓、绝对数量庞大的婴儿潮一代为子女造成了沉重的负担，而且他们拥有相当长的预期寿命。
Countries where pension reforms were introduced early have been able to limit the resulting burden on the young and keep the balance between generations approximately fair.	那些较早推行养老金改革的国家勉强能够限制年轻人所承受的���担，从而实现代际负担的相对平衡。
But countries where reforms were delayed have allowed that balance to place the young at a disadvantage.	但那些推迟改革的国家却已坐视年轻人陷入到相当不利的境地。
Finally, consider the labor market.	最后，再来看劳动力市场。
Over the last decade, conditions for new entrants have worsened markedly in many countries.	过去十年，很多国家新进劳动力面临的条件显著恶化。
The number of young people categorized as NEET (neither in employment nor in education or training) currently stands at 10.2 million in the US and 14 million in the EU.	被称之为NEET（即既未就业也未接受教育或培训）的年轻一族在美国有1020万 、欧盟则有1400万。
Furthermore, many of those who have recently entered the labor market have suffered from job insecurity and repeated spells of unemployment.	此外，很多新进劳力动都面临着缺乏就业安全和反复失业的境况。
In continental Europe, especially, young workers are the first to suffer from economic downturns.	在欧洲大陆，也是年轻劳动者最先尝到经济衰退之苦。
On all of these issues – climate, debt, pensions, and jobs – the younger generations have been made relatively worse off by developments over the last quarter-century.	在气候、债务、养老金和就业等所有问题上，过去四分之一世纪的发展只是让年轻人的处境进一步恶化。
A telling symbol is that there is often more poverty among the young than among the elderly.	一个生动的标志是年轻人中的贫困人数比老年人更多。
This ought to be a major political issue, with significant implications for public finances, social protection, tax policy, and labor market regulation. And it reinforces the imperative of reviving growth through productivity-boosting policies.	这本来应该成为重大政治问题，对公共财政、社会保障、税收政策和劳动力市场监管都产生显著的影响，并且刻不容缓地促使领导人推进通过提高生产率恢复经济的举措。
Yet the new generation gap has had little direct political effect.	但新生代差异却几乎没有造成任何直接的政治影响。
It hardly arises in electoral debate and has generally not led to the emergence of new parties or movements.	它几乎没有在选举辩论中出现，总体而言也没有导致产生新的运动和政党。
Instead, the generational divide shows up in electoral participation.	相反，在选举参与度方面却明显体现出两代人的不同。
In the latest US mid-term elections, the turnout rate among younger citizens was less than 20%, compared to more than 50% for senior voters.	在最新的美国中期选举中，年轻民众的投票率低于20 % ， 而老年公民却在50%以上。
Similar trends are observable in other countries.	类似的趋势也能在其他国家观察到。
Despite the increased uncertainty they face, younger citizens are much more disengaged from electoral politics than their parents and grandparents were at the same age.	尽管所面临的不确定性增加，但年轻人较之其父辈和祖父辈同龄时参与选举政治的意愿却显著下降。
This generational gap in electoral participation explains why politicians care more about the elderly than about the young.	选举参与度方面的代沟解释了政治家为什么关心老年人比年轻人更多。
But in aging societies, the more the young abstain from voting, the more decisions by parliaments and governments will be biased against their interests.	但是在老龄化社会，年轻人越不愿投票，议会和政府的决策对其利益的考虑也就越少。
True, parents are generally not selfish.	诚然，父母一般都非常无私。
They help their children through private transfers and grants.	他们会通过私人转移和赠与等方式来帮助自己的子女。
But only those with income and wealth can provide meaningful support.	但只有那些拥有收入和财富者才能提供有意义的支持。
The result of neglecting young people collectively while supporting them privately is social inequality on a massive scale.	忽视年轻人群体利益而私下为其提供支持必然导致大规模社会不平等。
How to redress generational biases in the political system is a key question for all democracies.	如何纠正代际偏见是所有民主国家政治体系的关键问题。
Solutions do exist: mandatory voting, term limits for elected officials, and youth parliaments or special bodies to examine intergenerational issues, for example.	的确存在解决方案：比方说强制投票、当选官员任期限制、青年议会或研究代际问题的专门机构。
But such measures are either difficult to implement or only moderately effective in view of the magnitude of the challenges.	但这些举措要么难以实施、要么考虑到挑战的规模其效果非常有限。
Current trends are clearly unsustainable politically and socially.	目前的趋势显然在政治和社会方面是不可持续的。
What is unclear is when and how young people will recognize that and make themselves heard.	但我们尚不清楚年轻人会在何时以及以何种方式认识到这个问题，并让自己的意见被全社会听到。
	
Your Genes or Mine, How Different Are We?	你我的基因，我们有何不同？
For some time, scientists have believed that individual human beings were 99.9% genetically identical.	曾经有一段时间，科学家们认为人类单个个体99.9%的基因都是相同的。
The 0.1% of the genome that was different (approximately 3,000,000 bases of DNA) was comprised of “single nucleotide polymorphisms” (SNPs are alterations of the individual bases of DNA) scattered throughout the genome.	另外不同的0.1 % （ 大约为3, 000,000个碱基）是由散布于基因组的 “单核苷酸多态性”组成的（单核苷酸多态性即SNPs，为DNA单个碱基的改变 ） 。
It was thought that some of these DNA alterations may in part explain some of the physical differences that exist between two different, but otherwise normal individuals.	这些DNA的改变被认为可以或多或少地解释两个不同的、普通个体之间存在的身体差异。
In the summer of 2004, two groups of scientists working independently (one led by researchers at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and the other led by researchers at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories) called this scientific dogma into question.	2004年的夏令时节，两个独立开展研究的科学家团体对这一科学教条提出了疑问。 （其中一个团体由哈佛医学院、伯明翰大学以及波士顿女子医院的研究者负责，另一个团体由冷泉港实验室的研究者负责 ） 。
Their research identified hundreds of regions of the human genome where the number of copies of a particular DNA segment varied from individual to individual.	他们的研究涉及到成百上千的人类基因区域，在这些区域，特殊DNA片断的组数因个体而不同。
With only a few exceptions, all DNA segments were thought to exist in two copies (one copy inherited from your mother and one copy inherited from your father).	除了少数几个例外，所有的DNA片断都被认为存在于两个基因组中（一个遗传于母亲，另一个遗传于父亲 ） 。
Both studies showed that there are hundreds of regions of the genome that could have more or less than the expected two copies.	两份研究都显示在成百上千的基因区域中都有可能多于所认为的两个基因组。
This alerted scientists to the existence of a larger source of genetic variation than was previously understood, and forced us to speculate on the implications of this discovery.	这些科学家提出的存在更多基因差异来源的想法使我们对其相关性展开了想象。
This discovery was made recently because until now, the technology was not available to comprehensively assess genomic imbalances in a genome-wide fashion.	这些探索是最近才开展的，原因是到目前为止，以整组基因的方式进行基因不平衡性全面评定的技术还达不到要求。
That has changed over the last five or six years, with the development of a technique known as “array-based comparative genomic hybridization” (array-CGH), revolutionizing genetic research and diagnostics.	随着被称为“微矩阵列比较型基因杂交法 ” （ array-CGH）技术的开发，这种情况在过去的五到六年得到了改变。
About three years ago at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, when we were seeking a potential tool for high-resolution diagnostics, array-CGH offered the hope of providing a reliable and efficient genome-wide test that could detect gains or losses in an unbiased and non-subjective fashion.	该技术使得基因研究和诊断被彻底变革。 大致三年前在伯明翰大学和女子医院，在寻求高精诊断的有利工具时，array-CGH提供了可靠、有效的整组基因测试的希望，该测试可公正地找到得失。
When validation experiments were performed that compared the DNA from one “normal, healthy” individual with the DNA from another “normal, healthy” individual, we were astonished to find an average of 12 DNA fragments that showed copy number differences between the two individuals being compared.	在对两个“正常的、健康的”个体之间的DNA进行比较的有效试验时，我们惊奇地发现在所比较的两个个体中，平均存在12个显示组数差异的DNA片断。
These became known as copy number variants, or CNVs.	这被称为组数差异（或CNVs ） 。
Combining the data from our study and the study from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, over 300 regions of the genome were found to exhibit CNVs among normal individuals.	结合我方以及冷泉谷实验室的研究数据，我们发现在正常个体中，有超过300个基因区域存在CNVs。
Since these two initial studies, many other groups, including ours, have confirmed and documented many more CNVs in other individuals studied.	伴随着这两份最初研究的开展 ，其它许多团体（包括我们）证实了其他个体中的CNVs现象。
This is the goal of the Structural Genomic Variation Consortium’s Copy Number Variation Project, which aims at providing researchers the most comprehensive list and characterization of CNVs in humans.	这即是结构基因改变协会的组数改变项目的目标，旨在为研究者提供人类CNVs的最全面信息及说明。
The Consortium recently assessed 270 individuals from four populations with ancestry in Africa, Asia or Europe (known as the HapMap collection) to construct a new map of the human genome.	该协会近期对来自四个种群的270个个体开展了评估（这些个体具有非洲、亚洲或欧洲的血统, 被称为抽样图谱集）以构建人类基因的新图谱。
Using two complementary genome-wide technologies, with subsequent validation studies, a total of 1,447 CNVs were identified.	通过使用两种互补的整组基因技术以及随后的有效研究，总计有1,447 份CNVs被识别。
The data clearly demonstrate that individuals are not as genetically similar as once thought.	该数据清楚地表明个体基因并不像以往所认为的是类似的。
Many of the regions in which the CNVs were identified overlapped known disease genes.	许多CNVs被交叠识别的区域为疾病基因。
Since they are being identified in normal individuals, CNVs may not necessarily be a direct cause of human disease, but many may confer susceptibility to certain diseases, serve as disease markers, and/or indicate potential regions of genomic instability.	因为CNVs是在正常个体中被识别的，所以它们不是疾病的直接原因，但许多CNVs会造成对某些疾病的易感性，成为疾病的标志，并且/或者表明重要区域的基因不稳定性。
Some CNVs are also associated with genes involved in immune response and detoxification-related metabolism (some of the human body’s reactions to the environment that we live in).	某些CNVs联合了免疫回应和解毒相关代谢（人类对所居住环境的一些反应）中的基因。
Indeed, some CNVs may turn out to explain why some people react differently to specific medications.	事实上，某些CNVs可以解释为什么一些人对某些药品的反应各异。
Hopefully, a more comprehensive understanding of human genetic variation (i.e. single base pair changes and structural genomic variation, such as CNVs) will ultimately help physicians to prescribe medication in a more individualized manner, that would result in maximum therapeutic effects to each patient, with minimal side effects.	对人类基因改变（比如单碱基对改变和结构性基因改变，如CNVs）更全面的了解有望帮助医生在开药时考虑到个体差异性，这将带来对病人最好的治疗效果，而使副作用降到最小限度。
Overall, we anticipate that many of these CNVs will provide explanations to how we adapt and interact with our ever-changing environment.	总之，我们可以预想CNVs能够解释我们如何适应并与不断改变的环境的互相作用。
Indeed, as studies continue to identify and characterize CNVs, we anticipate achieving a better understanding of the relationship between these genetic variations, complex diseases, and human adaptability.	基于对CNVs 的识别和特性的更多研究，我们可以预想到更多地了解基因改变、疑难杂症和人类适应性之间的关系。
	
Unburdening the Facebook Generation	不要拖累Facebook一代
LOS ANGELES – Once again, young people have gotten the short end of the political stick.	洛杉矶 — — 年轻人再一次在政治上遭遇了不公平。
The outcome of the United Kingdom’s Brexit referendum is but another reminder of a yawning generational divide that cuts across political affiliation, income levels, and race.	英国脱欧公投的结果仅仅是撕裂政治派别、收入水平和种族关系等不断扩大的代际鸿沟的另一种形式的提醒。
Almost 75% of UK voters aged 18-24 voted to “Remain” in the European Union, only to have “Leave” imposed on them by older voters.	18到24岁的英国选民近75%投票留欧，但结果却是上了年纪的选民将“退欧”的结果强加给他们。
And this is just one of several ways in which millennials’ economic future, and that of their children, is being determined by others.	这只是别人决定千禧一代及其子孙经济未来的其中一种方式。
I am in my late fifties, and I worry that our generation in the advanced world will be remembered – to our shame and chagrin – as the one that lost the economic plot.	我本人是五零后，我感到羞愧和懊恼的是，我担心我们这代人在发达经济体将作为丧失经济主动权的一代被载入史册。
In the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis, we feasted on leverage, feeling increasingly entitled to use credit to live beyond our means and to assume too much speculative financial risk.	2008年全球金融危机前，我们享受着杠杆盛宴，越来越习惯于借助信用过超出我们能力的生活并承担过多的投机金融风险。
We stopped investing in genuine engines of growth, letting our infrastructure decay, our education system lag, and our worker training and retooling programs erode.	我们停止了对真正增长引擎的投资，任由我们的基础设施破败、教育体制落后、工人培训及重组计划遭到破坏。
We allowed the budget to be taken hostage by special interests, which has resulted in a fragmentation of the tax system that, no surprise, has imparted yet another unfair anti-growth bias to the economic system.	我们坐视特殊利益群体绑架预算，从而导致税收体制碎片化并再次阻碍了经济体系的发展。
And we witnessed a dramatic worsening in inequality, not just of income and wealth, but also of opportunity.	我们目睹了不平等大幅恶化，这种不平等不仅涉及到财富和收入，而且也涉及到机会。
The 2008 crisis should have been our economic wake-up call.	2008年危机本应在经济上为我们敲响警钟。
It wasn’t.	但实际却并未起到这样的效果。
Rather than using the crisis to catalyze change, we essentially rolled over and went back to doing more of the same.	我们不仅没有利用这次危机来促进改革，反而放弃责任，仍然沿用以前旧的方法。
Specifically, we simply exchanged private factories of credit and leverage for public ones.	具体来讲，我们只是将私营企业信贷置换成了公共部门杠杆。
We swapped an over-leveraged banking system for experimental liquidity injections by hyperactive monetary authorities.	我们将杠杆过高的银行体系换成了由极度活跃的货币当局推进流动性注入试验。
In the process, we overburdened central banks, risking their credibility and political autonomy, as well as future financial stability.	在此过程中，我们加重了央行的负担，用央行的信誉、政治主权和金融稳定的未来冒险。
Emerging from the crisis, we shifted private liabilities from banks’ balance sheets to taxpayers, including future ones, yet we failed to fix fully the bailed-out financial sector.	后危机时代，我们将银行资产负债表上的私人债务转换成纳税人债务，甚至包括未来的纳税人，却未能强制接受救助的金融体系进行改革。
We let inequality worsen, and stood by as too many young people in Europe languished in joblessness, risking a scary transition from unemployment to unemployability.	我们坐视不平等恶化，面对欧洲众多年轻人陷入失业窘境、又从失业过渡到无能力就业的可怕局面无动于衷。
In short, we didn’t do nearly enough to reinvigorate the engines of sustainable inclusive growth, thereby also weakening potential output and threatening future economic performance.	总之，我们为重振包容性可持续发展引擎所做的工作还远远不够，因此削弱了潜在生产能力，并对未来的经济效益造成威胁。
And we are compounding these serial miscarriages with a grand failure to act on longer-term sustainability, particularly when it comes to the planet and social cohesion.	尤其在涉及到环境保护和社会凝聚力的问题上，我们不仅犯下了一系列错误，更大的问题是未能采取行动保障长期可持续发展。
Poor economics has naturally spilled over into messy politics, as growing segments of the population have lost trust in the political establishment, business elites, and expert opinion.	有贫穷的经济自然就会有纷乱的政治，越来越多人已经对政治体制、商业精英和专家意见失去了信任。
The resulting political fragmentation, including the rise of fringe and anti-establishment movements, has made it even harder to devise more appropriate economic-policy responses.	由此造成的政治分裂，包括边缘及反体制运动的兴起，进一步加大了制定恰当经济政策的难度。
To add insult to injury, we are now permitting a regulatory backlash against technological innovations that disrupt entrenched and inefficient industries, and that provide people with greater control over their lives and wellbeing.	雪上加霜的是，我们正在对破坏技术创新的监管反弹置之不理，恰恰是这些技术创新动摇了根深蒂固的无效产业，让人们对自己的生活和福祉有更大的自主权。
Growing restrictions on companies such as Airbnb and Uber hit the young particularly hard, both as producers and as consumers.	对Airbnb和Uber等企业的限制在生产和消费领域对年轻人造成了特别沉重的打击。
If we do not change course soon, subsequent generations will confront self-reinforcing economic, financial, and political tendencies that burden them with too little growth, too much debt, artificially inflated asset prices, and alarming levels of inequality and partisan political polarization.	如果我们不能迅速改变，我们的后代将被迫面对自我强化的经济、金融和政治趋势，他们将被迫背负低增长、高债务、人为抬高资产价格、惊人不平等及党派政治两极分化所带来的负担。
Fortunately, we are aware of the mounting problem, worried about its consequences, and have a good sense of how to bring about the much-needed pivot.	幸运的是，我们意识到了问题的严重性、对这种情况所带来的后果深感忧虑并完全了解解决问题的关键。
Given the role of technological innovation, much of which is youth-led, even a small reorientation of policies could have a meaningful and rapid impact on the economy.	鉴于技术创新主要由年轻人主导，就连细微的政策调整也能对经济产生迅速、积极的影响。
Through a more comprehensive policy approach, we could turn a vicious cycle of economic stagnation, social immobility, and market volatility into a virtuous cycle of inclusive growth, genuine financial stability, and greater political coherence.	通过全面落实相关政策，我们可以把经济停滞、社会固化和市场波动的恶性循环转化为包容性增长、金融稳定和加强政治协调的良性循环。
What is needed, in particular, is simultaneous progress on pro-growth structural reforms, better demand management, addressing pockets of excessive indebtedness, and improving regional and global policy frameworks.	具体地讲，我们需要同步推进有利于增长的结构性改革、加强需求管理、解决过度负债问题并改善地区和全球政策框架。
While highly desirable, such changes will materialize only if greater constructive pressure is placed on politicians.	虽然上述改革措施十分可取，但只有对政客施加更多建设性压力这样的改革才能兑现。
Simply put, few politicians will champion changes that promise longer-term benefits but often come with short-term disruptions.	简单地讲，没有多少政客愿意推动牺牲短期利益来换取长期利益的改革。
And the older voters who back them will resist any meaningful erosion of their entitlements – even turning, when they perceive a threat to their interests, to populist politicians and dangerously simplistic solutions such as Brexit.	那些支持他们的年长选民会对任何侵蚀自身权利的改革方案产生抵触情绪 — — 甚至在自身利益遭到威胁时求助于民粹主义政客和英国退欧等简单而危险的解决方案。
Sadly, young people have been overly complacent when it comes to political participation, notably on matters that directly affect their wellbeing and that of their children.	悲哀的是，在涉及政治参与、尤其是直接影响自身及后代福利的问题上年轻人一直过度自满。
Yes, almost three-quarters of young voters backed the UK’s “Remain” campaign.	没错，支持英国“留欧”运动的年轻选民占到近3/4。
But only a third of them turned out.	但只有1/3的人真正参与了投票。
In contrast, the participation rate for those over 65 was more than 80%. Undoubtedly, the absence of young people at the polls left the decision in the hands of older people, whose preferences and motivations differ, even if innocently.	毫无疑问，年轻人缺席投票给了年长选民决定权，而即便没有恶意，但年长者的动机和偏好都不同于年轻人。
Millennials have impressively gained a greater say in how they communicate, travel, source and disseminate information, pool their resources, interact with businesses, and much else.	千禧一代在沟通、旅行、获取和传播信息、集中资源、与企业互动以及众多其他方面赢得了令人印象深刻的话语权。
Now they must seek a greater say in electing their political representatives and in holding them accountable.	现在他们必须在选举自身政治代表并要求他们承担责任方面寻求更大的发言权。
If they don’t, my generation will – mostly inadvertently – continue to borrow excessively from their future.	如果他们不这样做，我们这代人将在不经意间继续过度透支他们的未来。
	
A Prisoner’s Reflections on Nelson Mandela	纳尔逊·曼德拉牢狱生活反思
KHARKIV – Incarceration is said to leave you with a feeling of helplessness and vulnerability.	哈尔科夫 — — 监禁据说能令人体会到无助和脆弱。
But the truth of life for a political prisoner, even for one on a hunger strike, is the opposite.	但政治犯、即使是绝食政治犯的真实生活也恰恰反其道而行之。
As a prisoner, I have been forced to focus on what is essential about myself, my political beliefs, and my country.	身为囚犯的我曾被迫反省我的政治信仰、国家，以及什么对我必不可少。
So I can almost feel the presence of the brave women and men, old and young, who have gathered in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities to defend their dreams of a democratic and European future.	因此我几乎可以感觉到聚集在基辅和其他乌克兰城市捍卫民主和欧洲未来之梦的勇敢的男男女女、老老少少。
In prison, your hopes and dreams become your reality.	在狱中，希望和梦想与现实是完全重合的。
I am sure that Nelson Mandela would have understood my feelings and agreed.	我相信纳尔逊·曼德拉理解并赞同我的感受。
The South African apartheid regime may have locked him away for almost three decades, but in the great Soweto protests and the other demonstrations for freedom and equality, courageous young South Africans invariably looked to his example and felt his presence.	南非种族隔离政权可能已经囚禁了他近30年，但在大规模索韦托抗议和其他争取自由和平等的示威行动里，勇敢的南非年轻人不约而同地学习他的榜样、感受他的存在。
Around the world, most people now rightly celebrate the gentle dignity with which Mandela led South Africa out of the political wilderness.	世界各地多数民众现在理所当然地赞美曼德拉领导南非走出政治旷野的温和与尊严。
Even here, behind prison bars and 24-hour surveillance of the type that he experienced for so long, I can conjure the warmth of his broad smile, merry eyes, and those colorful Hawaiian-style shirts that he wore with such panache.	即使在监狱铁窗和他长期经历的24小时监控背后，我一样能想象出他灿烂温和的笑容、快乐的眼神和身上五颜六色的夏威夷衬衫。
And I can admire his unyielding – and, yes, sometimes wily – commitment to reconciliation, which saved his country from the race war that those who refused to accept the end of white-minority rule saw as inevitable.	但我最欣赏他不屈不挠，有时甚至透露出些许狡黠的和解原则，正是这些原则让南非避免陷入种族内战，而在拒绝接受白人少数统治末日的人看来内战是必然的结果。
How wrong they were, and how miraculous was Mandela’s achievement in making even his most implacable enemies feel at home in post-apartheid South Africa.	他们实在错得离谱，因为曼德拉奇迹般地让最不共戴天的敌人也在后种族隔离时代的南非找到了家一般的感觉。
But here, in this place, it is not Mandela the statesman who touches my soul and fires my imagination.	但此时此刻，触动我的灵魂、激发我的想象力的却不是政治家曼德拉。
“My” Mandela is the prisoner, the Mandela of Robben Island, who endured 27 years behind bars (18 of them on a rock in the South Atlantic) and yet emerged with his spirit intact, brimming with a vision of a tolerant South Africa, a country liberated even for apartheid’s architects and beneficiaries.	“我的”曼德拉是罗本岛上忍受了27年铁窗生涯但仍然不改初衷的囚犯（其中18年他被关押在南大西洋岛礁 ） 。 曼德拉眼前充斥着宽容南非的愿景，即使是种族隔离的设计和受益者同样能够享受这里的自由。
No purges marked the end of white rule.	白人统治结束没有带来种族清洗。
There were no witch-hunts, nor was there summary justice.	没有政治迫害，也没有简单执法。
All that Mandela demanded was that the truth about the past be revealed.	曼德拉只要求公布过去的真相。
Through the unique innovation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Mandela found the only viable bridge between his country’s racist legacy and its multi-racial present and future – a combination of political genius and humane wisdom that only the greatest of leaders possess.	通过真相与和解委员会的独特创造，曼德拉找到了南非种族主义传统和多种族现在与未来间唯一的桥梁 — — 他的所作所为融会了最伟大领袖才具备的人文智慧和政治天才。
Mandela was able to guide South Africa to freedom, because he was able to see its future more clearly than those who lived through the apartheid years outside of prison.	曼德拉能引导南非走向自由，因为他比狱外渡过种族隔离年代的人更能清楚预见到南非的未来。
Indeed, he possessed that rare clarity of moral vision that prison – perhaps like no other environment – can nurture.	在他身上，监狱比其他任何环境更能勾画出清晰的道德目标。
Imprisonment brought Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn this clarity as well.	亚历山大·索尔仁尼琴眼中的清晰愿景同样源自于监禁生活。
“Gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties, either – but right through every human heart – and through all human hearts,” he wrote in The Gulag Archipelago.	他在《古拉格群岛》中写道 ， “ 我逐渐意识到善恶的分界线不在于国家、不在于阶级、也不在于政党，而在于我们每个人的内心之中。
“This line shifts….And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained.	这条线不断变化…即使已不堪邪恶重负的心灵也保留着小小的善的桥头堡。
And even in the best of all hearts, there remains...an un-uprooted small corner of evil.”	而即使是在���善良的内心，仍留有未曾连根拔起的小小的恶的角落 。 ”
The ability to begin to see more clearly than most the inner workings of the human soul is one of the few gifts that imprisonment can bestow.	监狱生活恰恰可以带来超乎多数人类灵魂的认识清晰度。
Forced to reckon with your own vulnerability, isolation, and losses (and seemingly lost cause), you learn to look more carefully into the human heart – yours and that of your jailers.	被迫对自身的弱点、孤立、损失（以及看似迷失的事业）进行思考，你学会了如何审视人类（你和你的看守）内心的欲望。
Mandela epitomized this rare gift.	曼德拉身上汇聚了这种难得的天赋。
How else could he have personally invited one of his Robben Island jailers to attend his inauguration as South Africa’s first democratically elected president?	否则他怎么会亲自邀请他在罗本岛上的监狱看守出席他担任南非首任民选总统的就职典礼？
Of course, behind Mandela’s generous spirit was a character of steel.	当然，在曼德拉慷慨精神的背后是他刚强的性格。
He bore his imprisonment for the sake of his cause.	他为了自己的事业忍受着监禁生活。
And he bore the anguish of the suffering imposed on his family.	他独自承受着亲人遭受折磨的痛苦。
And yet he neither broke nor surrendered to the rage that would have consumed most people.	但他在足以吞噬大部分人的愤怒面前既没有崩溃，也没有投降。
As usual, Mandela’s own words about his day of personal liberation show how well he understood this: “As I walked out the door toward the gate that would lead to my freedom, I knew if I didn’t leave my bitterness and hatred behind, I’d still be in prison.”	像以往一样，曼德拉对个人解放日的话语显示出他深刻的理解 ： “ 当我走向通往自由的大门时，我知道如果我不放下过去的仇恨和痛苦，我就仍然是一名囚徒 。 ”
And just as Mandela knew in his prison cell that apartheid would one day fall, I know in my solitude that Ukraine’s ultimate triumph as a European democracy is certain.	正如监狱里的曼德拉知道种族隔离终有一天会土崩瓦解，我在孤独的牢狱生涯中也知道乌克兰最终必将成为成功的欧洲民主国家。
	
Sweet Caroline in Tokyo	亲爱的卡洛琳来到东京
TOKYO – Fifty years have passed since the assassination of US President John F. Kennedy, with official ceremonies held in Washington, DC, and Dallas to commemorate the anniversary.	东京—美国总统约翰·肯尼迪遇刺已经过去了五十年，华盛顿和达拉斯都举行了正式的仪式纪念这一时刻。
But JFK’s eldest daughter, Caroline Kennedy, was not present at either event; she had just taken up her post in Tokyo as the 29th US Ambassador to Japan.	但肯尼迪的长女卡洛琳·肯尼迪没有现身于这两个场合；她刚刚履新第29任美国驻日本大使。
On November 19, thousands of people lined the streets to catch a glimpse of Kennedy as she made her way from Tokyo Station to the Imperial Palace, around a kilometer away, by horse-drawn carriage to present her credentials to the emperor.	11月19日，肯尼迪乘坐马车从东京站前往一千米外的日本皇宫，向天皇递交自己的任命状，数千人聚集在街道两侧，争相一睹肯尼迪的风采。
Waving to the onlookers, she looked like Snow White.	肯尼迪朝群众挥手致意，看起来就像是白雪公主。
November 22, 1963, was also the day satellite broadcasting from the United States to Japan began, and many Japanese got up early to watch a speech by JFK in Dallas that began at 5:30 a.m.	1963年11月22日是美国-日本卫星广播开通的日子，许多日本人早早起床，只为收看清晨5:30开始的肯尼迪达拉斯演讲。
But, rather than airing the speech, the broadcast brought the shocking news of the assassination.	但是，广播并没有送出肯尼迪的声音，而是传来了肯尼迪遇刺的惊天噩耗。
The image of young Caroline – the inspiration for Neil Diamond’s famous song – solemnly standing beside her three-year-old brother as he saluted his father’s coffin is deeply engrained in the hearts of Japan’s people.	年轻的卡洛琳肃穆地站在朝父亲棺椁敬礼三岁的弟弟身边 — — 受尼尔·戴蒙德（Neil Diamond）名曲的启发 — — 这一形象深深地刻在日本人民心头。
So there probably is not a single Japanese who would not welcome her as US Ambassador.	因此，恐怕没有一位日本人会不欢迎她成为美国大使。
US ambassadors to Japan have come in three types.	美国驻日本大使有三种类型。
There have been academic experts on Japan, like the acclaimed scholar Edwin Reischauer.	一种是日本学专家，如广受欢迎的赖肖尔（Edwin Reischauer ） 。
There have also been political heavyweights, such as Michael Mansfield, a long-time Democratic majority leader of the US Senate, former Vice President Walter Mondale, former Speaker of the House of Representatives Thomas Foley, and Senator Howard Baker, who also served as President Ronald Reagan’s chief of staff.	一种是重磅政治人物，如长期担任美国参议院民主党多数领袖的曼斯菲尔德（Michael Mansfield ） 、 前副总统蒙代尔（Walter Mondale ） 、 前众议院发言人弗雷（Thomas Foley）和参议员、罗纳德·里根总统幕僚长贝克尔（Howard Baker ） 。
The third type are presidential political appointees, such as Thomas Schieffer, a former business partner of President George W. Bush, and John Roos, a noted Silicon Valley lawyer.	第三类来自总统的政治任命，如谢佛（Thomas Schieffer）是小布什的前商业伙伴；罗斯（John Roos）是前硅谷律师。
Clearly, Caroline Kennedy, an important early supporter of President Barack Obama, is in this category.	显然，作为奥巴马重要的早期支持者，卡洛琳·肯尼迪也属于这一类。
Indeed, her backing for Obama in the Democratic Party primaries in 2008, when he was still a relatively unknown senator from Illinois, gave his campaign credibility among party insiders who remain loyal to her family’s legacy.	事实上，她在2008年民主党预选时就支持奥巴马，当时他还只是个相对无名的伊利诺伊州参议员。 卡洛琳使奥巴马的竞选赢得了仍忠于肯尼迪家族的民主党内人物中间的信誉。
Kennedy’s address to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during her confirmation hearing elicited bipartisan support – a rare occurrence nowadays, given America’s highly polarized national politics – and she received unanimous approval.	在参议院对外关系委员会的任命确认听证会演讲中，肯尼迪获得了来自两党的支持 — — 者在当下美国高度两极分化的国内政坛中时不多见的 — — 赢得了一致通过。
Although she lacks formal political or diplomatic experience, her personal connections, particularly to Obama, will have great significance for US-Japan relations.	尽管她缺少正式的政治和外交经验，但她的个人关系，特别是与奥巴马的关系，将极大地影响美日关系。
And there are pressing issues that need the new ambassador’s attention.	这位新大使需要关注一些紧迫问题。
For example, there are security questions related to strengthening the alliance between Japan and the US, including the relocation of the Futenma Air Station, the base of operations for the US Marine Corps on Okinawa.	比如与强化美日安全同盟有关的问题，包括处置普天间空军基地和美国冲绳海军基地。
There are also issues related to economic cooperation, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the proposed mega-regional free-trade treaty covering Pacific Rim economies.	还有与经济合作有关的问题，比如谈判中的覆盖环太平洋经济体的巨型地区自由贸易协定 — — 跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（TPP ） 。
Although powerful domestic interest groups, particularly those representing the agricultural sector, have objected to Japanese participation in the TPP negotiations, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government chose to join the talks late in the day.	尽管强大的国内利益集团，特别是代表农业部门的利益集团反对日本加入TPP谈判，但安倍晋三政府最后还是选择加入谈判。
Instead of banking the political capital that his high approval ratings had given him, he chose to spend some of it on an initiative that his predecessors had rejected, but that will help to transform myriad aspects of Japan’s economy.	安倍晋三没有选择巩固高支��率给他带来的政治资本，而是选择拿出一些政治资本用于追求被他的前任所拒绝，但有助于日本经济各个方面转型的计划。
Of course, given today’s hyper-partisan environment in the US, there is a danger that fast-track negotiating authority – under which Congress binds itself to an up-or-down vote on trade agreements (thereby precluding amendments and filibusters) – will not be given to the president.	当然，考虑当当今美国高度党派化的政治环境，美国总统未必能够获得“快车道”谈判权 — — 国会对贸易协定仍坚持要么否决要么通过的态度（从而排除了修正和拖延的空间 ） 。
If this roadblock cannot be overcome and the agreement stalls, the Abe government’s approval ratings will suffer, despite progress in the negotiations.	如果这一障碍无法克服，TPP谈判陷入僵局，那么安倍政府的支持率将受到影响，即便谈判取得进展。
Given the unanimity with which Kennedy was confirmed, she may be able to use her own political capital to help sell fast-track authority in Congress.	肯尼迪的任命获得了一致肯定，因此她有望利用其自身政治资本帮助国会授予奥巴马快车道谈判权。
The Abe government is banking on its high approval rating not only to participate in the TPP, but also to address the need to escape from 15 years of deflation and strengthen Japan’s national-security posture, which has been hamstrung for decades.	安倍政府不但依赖其高支持率参与TPP，还依赖高支持率解决走出15年通缩、强化日本国家安全姿态（几十年来一直处于瘫痪状态）的需要。
Given the nexus of issues that tie vital US interests to Japan’s reform process, Kennedy, with her character and skills, could well prove to be an essential link between the countries at a crucial point in their relationship.	这些问题将美国的关键利益与日本的改革过程捆绑在了一起，而肯尼迪的人格和技能能够让她成为两国关系关键点上的关键连接。
	
Who Lost Thailand?	谁输掉了泰国？
TOKYO – Thailand, Southeast Asia’s most developed and sophisticated economy, is teetering on the edge of the political abyss.	东京—泰国，东南亚最发达、最成熟的经济体，正在政治悬崖边沿徘徊。
Yet most of the rest of Asia appears to be averting its eyes from the country’s ongoing and increasingly anarchic unrest.	但亚洲大部分国家并没有把目光放在泰国日益高涨的无政府主义骚乱上。
That indifference is not only foolish; it is dangerous.	如此冷漠不但愚蠢，更十分危险。
Asia’s democracies now risk confronting the same harsh question that the United States faced when Mao Zedong marched into Beijing, and again when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ousted the Shah in Iran.	亚洲民主国家现在面临着美国在毛泽东入主北京和霍梅尼推翻伊朗国王时相同的紧迫问题。
Who, they will have to ask, lost Thailand?	他们必须问一问，谁输掉了泰国？
Much of the world is wondering how such a successful economy could allow its politics to spin out of control.	世界上很多国家奇怪于为何如此成功的经济体会让政治失控。
What accounts for the armies of protesters – distinguished, gang-like, by the color of their shirts – whose mutual antipathy often borders on nihilistic rage?	是什么让衣服颜色显著易辨、如黑帮般的游行大军上了街？ 而他们所表达的共同愤怒又往往是虚无的？
The roots of the current unrest extend back more than a decade, to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra’s first electoral victory in 2001.	当前乱象的根源可以追溯到十多年前。 2001年，前首相他信第一次在选举中获胜。
Thaksin’s triumph did not represent the normal alternation in power that one finds in a democracy.	他信的胜利并没有带来民主国家常见的权力更迭。
Instead, his victory heralded the political rise of the country’s poor, long-silenced rural majority.	相反，他的胜利标志着泰国长期处于分割状态的贫穷农村大众的政治崛起。
Bangkok’s entrenched elite recoiled in alarm.	曼谷的老牌精英成了杯弓蛇影。
But, instead of learning to compete with Thaksin for the votes of Thailand’s rural poor, the country’s urban elite (including the powerful military) sought to delegitimize his rule.	但是，泰国城市精英（包括强大的军方）并没有通过选票和泰国困苦农民竞争，而是选择推翻他信的合法执政地位。
When he was re-elected by an even larger majority, his government was overthrown, his political party was banned by the Supreme Court, and he was forced to flee the country after corruption charges against him led to a criminal conviction.	在他信以更大的优势获得连任后，他的政府遭到了颠覆，他的政党被最高法院取缔，他也被迫在因为腐败指控被判有罪后逃亡。
Yet Thaksin’s supporters did not abandon him.	但他信的支持者并没有抛弃他。
When Thailand’s military returned to their barracks, many Thai citizens voted for Thaksin at one remove, with his sister – Yingluck Shinawatra, a long-time executive at Thaksin’s communications firm – becoming Prime Minister, supported by a powerful parliamentary majority.	当泰国军方回归军营后，许多泰国公民坚定地支持他信，因此其妹、长期担任他信的通信公司首席执行官的英拉在议会压倒多数的支持下成为总理。
For much of her term in office, Yingluck garnered praise for her pragmatism, and for seeking to ameliorate the antagonism of her opponents.	在执政的大部分时间里，英拉凭借其实用主义作风以及试图缓解反对派反应而赢得赞誉。
But that praise and success appears to have bred a form of hubris.	但她获得的赞誉和成功也催生了自大。
She proposed an amnesty law that would have not only pardoned opposition leaders, including Abhisit Vejjajiva, her predecessor as prime minister (who faces murder charges), but allowed her brother to return to the country.	她所提出的的大赦法不但将原宥她的前任、面临谋杀指控的阿披实（Abhisit Vejjajiva）等反对派领袖，也将允许她的兄长他信回国。
And, in defiance of a Supreme Court ruling, she sought a constitutional amendment that would make the Senate, whose members are appointed, an elected body.	此外，她无视最高法院的裁决，寻求通过修宪让参议院议员由制定变为选举产生。
The opposition, sensing that its moment had arrived, launched a wave of street protests.	反对派认为时机已到，发动了一系列街头游行。
Yingluck, in an effort to defuse the situation, called for a parliamentary election in February.	为了平息事态，英拉宣布在2月举行议会选举。
But the opposition has rejected this and says that it will boycott the vote.	但反对派拒绝了这一方案，表示将抵制选举。
It fears – rightly, most people suspect – that the Thaksin camp will be returned to power in any free and fair vote.	反对派担心 — — 大部分人认为确实需要担心 — — 自由公平的选举会让他信阵营重新掌权。
So, in essence, what is happening in Thailand is an attempted nullification of democracy by the opposition and the country’s entrenched elite.	因此，从本质上说，泰国发生的其实是反对派和老牌精英试图推翻民主。
Unable to compete successfully with Thaksin for votes, they now want to dilute Thai democracy in order to prevent the electorate from ever again choosing a government that goes against their will.	他们无力在选举中与他信一决雌雄，因此希望推翻泰国的民主制度，以防止当选者选择与他们的意愿作对的政府。
If Thailand were an insignificant country with little geostrategic weight, its problems might not matter as much as they do to the rest of Asia.	如果泰国是一个在地缘战略上无关紧要的小国，那���它的问题对亚洲其他国家或许并没有什么大不了的。
But Thailand is Southeast Asia’s lynchpin economy.	但泰国是东南亚至关重要的经济体。
It is a key partner for Myanmar (Burma) as it makes its own political and economic transition, and it is a hub for trade with neighboring Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam.	它是缅甸在其自身政治和经济过渡阶段的重要伙伴，也是邻国柬埔寨、老挝和越南的贸易枢纽。
But the biggest reason that Thailand matters for Asia’s democracies is fierce competition for influence between a rising China and the democratic world.	但泰国对亚洲民主国家之所以重要，最大的原因是崛起的中国和民主世界之间正在进行激烈的竞争。
Until now, Thailand has been a firm member of the democratic camp.	到目前为止，泰国一直坚定地站在民主阵营。
Its military is mostly trained by the United States; indeed, it was the key staging point for the US during the Vietnam War.	泰国军队大多由美国训练；事实上，泰国也是越南战争期间美国在的重要驻军地点。
Likewise, Japan and India have long regarded Thailand as a democratic bulwark in a neighborhood where some regimes – Cambodia and Laos – are firmly under China’s hegemonic sway.	类似地，日本和印度也一直视为周边国家中的民主堡垒，在它们的邻国中，柬埔寨和老挝等国家一直被中国的霸权主义牢牢地控制着。
Indeed, its government has proved to be a strong supporter of Myanmar’s president, Thein Sein, as he seeks to free his country from China’s tight embrace.	泰国政府是缅甸总统吴登盛的强大支持者，而吴登盛正在寻求让缅甸摆脱中国的牢牢控制。
By standing aside as Thailand’s opposition and traditional elite seek to undermine the country’s democracy in the name of a permanent right to rule, Asia’s democracies risk driving some elements of the Thaksin camp into the arms of China, which would happily accept the role of patron to so potent a political force.	泰国反对派和传统精英正在打着永久执政权利的名号破坏泰国的民主，如果亚洲民主国家袖手旁观，将有可能让他信阵营中的一些部分倒向中国的怀抱，而中国也将乐于接受为强如他信阵营的政治势力提供保护。
But this need not happen.	但这并非不可避免。
Thailand’s military has long and respectful ties not only with the US military, but with officers in Japan as well.	长期以来，泰国军方不但与美国军方有着良好关系，与日本军官关系也不错。
Thailand’s opposition politicians, many of whom were educated at top Western universities, may also be open to quiet advice that they are pushing things too far, not only putting Thailand’s stability at risk, but also jeopardizing regional security.	不少泰国反对派政客在顶尖西方大学受过教育，他们能够接受安静的建议 — — 行动有些过火，不但威胁了泰国的稳定，也影响了地区安全。
Just as, a decade ago, the West objected to the efforts of Turkey’s entrenched secular elite to rob Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s mildly Islamist AKP party of its democratic victory, it needs to speak clearly today in defense of Thai democracy.	正如十年前西方拒绝土耳其老牌精英推翻埃尔多安温和派AKP党的民主胜利的图谋，如今西方也需要旗帜鲜明地捍卫泰国民主。
The opposition’s claim that it is acting in the interests of the world’s democracies needs to be rebutted.	必须剥去反对派所宣称的他们是在为全世界民主需要而奋斗的说法的画皮。
Thaksin may be no saint, and some constitutional reform will be needed if political reconciliation is to come about.	他信不是圣人，要形成政治妥协也需要做出一些宪政改革。
But Thaksin’s governments, like that of his sister, have kept China at one remove from influence.	但他信政府和英拉政府都一致地抵制着中国的影响力。
That is the key strategic interest that is now at stake.	这才是如今最重要的战略利益。
Should Yingluck be ousted in a coup, or should the country’s democracy be hollowed out to preclude her return to power, the Shinawatras may be left with no choice but to seek support from Thailand’s giant neighbor to the north.	如果英拉被政变推翻，或泰国民主因为阻止她重新掌权而被架空，那么他信和英拉所属的西那瓦（Shinawatra）家族将别无选择，只能向中国寻求支持。
If that happens, we will all know who lost Thailand.	果真如此的话，我们所有人都将知道谁输掉了泰国。
We did.	我们。
	
Equality or Estrangement	平等还是隔阂
TOKYO – Those whom the gods would destroy, they grant their wishes.	东京—神要毁灭一个人，就会给他希望。
Will that bit of ancient wisdom now hold for the United States and Japan?	这一古老智慧对现在的美国和日本成立吗？
For a half-century, the US, which wrote Japan’s postwar “peace” constitution, has pressed the Japanese to play a greater role in maintaining Asian and global stability.	半个世纪以来，替日本制定了战后“和平”宪法的美国一直要求日本在维持亚洲和全球稳定方面扮演更重要的角色。
But now that Japan finally has a leader who agrees, the US is getting nervous, with Secretary of State John Kerry supposedly calling Japan under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe “unpredictable.”	但如今日本终于有了一位愿意这样做的领导人，而美国却开始紧张了，据说其国务卿约翰·克里称首相安倍晋三治下的日本“难以预测 ” 。
These strains in the US-Japan relationship – surely the foundation stone of Asian stability – first became noticeable in December, when Abe visited the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, which houses the “souls” of (among others) Class A war criminals from the Pacific War.	美日关系 — — 毫无疑问，这一关系是亚洲稳定的基石 — — 的这些掣肘首次进入公众视线是去年12月，当时安倍晋三访问了供奉太平洋战争甲级战犯（及其他 ） “ 灵位”的东京靖国神社。
The US has always criticized Japanese officials’ visits to the shrine, but through diplomatic channels.	美国一直对日本官员拜访靖国神社持批评态度，但都是通过外交渠道表达的。
This time, America voiced its displeasure openly.	而这一回美国公开表示了不满之情。
The US is rightly concerned about the negative impact of such pilgrimages on Japan’s relations with its neighbors, particularly China and South Korea.	美国担心惨败靖国神社会妨碍日本与邻国（特别是中国和韩国）的关系，这是正确的。
But the harsh tone publicly adopted by President Barack Obama’s administration raised serious concerns among some in Abe’s government who question Obama’s commitment to the alliance and suspect that he was using the Yasukuni issue as a pretext to signal a weakening of America’s defense commitment.	但美国总统奥巴马政府公开的强硬语调让安倍政府中的不少人产生了审慎的忧虑，质疑奥巴马关于美日同盟的承诺，并怀疑他准备把靖国神社问题作为弱化美国防务承诺的借口。
Such suspicions were sharpened after China declared its new Air Defense Identification Zone, which overlaps Japanese sovereign territory.	中国宣布其新的防空识别区的举动加深了这一质疑。 中国的防空识别区与部分日本领土重叠。
The US tried to have it both ways: though the Obama administration sent US bombers through the new ADIZ to demonstrate its refusal to recognize China’s move, it also told US commercial airliners to acknowledge the zone and report their flight plans to the Chinese authorities.	美国试图持两端：尽管奥巴马政府派遣美国轰炸机进入防空识别区以表明拒绝接受中国的举动，但它同时又通知美国商业航空公司承认防空识别区，向中国当局报告飞行计划。
Likewise, US acquiescence in China’s de facto ouster of the Philippines from the Scarborough Shoal (a disputed outcropping in the South China Sea) raised questions in Japan about the two countries’ supposed harmony of interests.	类似地，美国对中国将菲律宾人驱逐出黄岩岛（位于南海的争议岛礁）的事实举动采取了默许态度。 ，这让日本怀疑这两个国家有利益协调。
In fact, although the US extols the virtues of its partnership with Japan, successive American presidents have been vague about the details.	事实上，尽管美国大肆赞颂与日本的合作伙伴关系，但历届美国总统从来不对此做详细阐述。
Ultimately, the idea always seemed to be that Japan would pay more for defense, but the US would set the partnership’s objectives.	说到底，这一思想永远是日本为防务出钱，而美国则为其合作伙伴制定目标。
Abe’s conception of the US-Japan partnership presupposes much greater equality.	安倍晋三的美日合作伙伴关系概念以更大的平等为前提。
After all, a society like Japan, trying to escape two decades of economic malaise, cannot feel completely comfortable outsourcing its national-security strategy, even to an ally that is as respected and reliable as the US.	毕竟，对于日本这样的正在试图摆脱二十年经济低迷的社会，不可能心安理得地将其国家安全战略外包给他国，哪怕这个“他国”是最令人尊敬、最可靠的美国。
Far from being based on chest-thumping nationalism, Abe’s national-security strategy reflects, above all, a deep awareness of how a lost generation of economic growth has affected the Japanese.	安倍晋三的国家安全战略决非民族主义空头许诺，而是首先植根于深刻地理解失去的二十年对日本人的影响。
His bravura diplomatic performances sometimes give the impression that a self-confident Japan has been a normal feature of the global landscape.	他的大胆的外交举措有时会给人造成一种印象，认为自信的日本已经成为全球图景中的常规元素。
Strangely, it is all but forgotten – particularly by the Chinese – that for two decades Japan has watched China’s rise quietly from the sidelines (even supportively, to the extent that Japanese investors have poured in billions of dollars in the three decades since Deng Xiaoping opened the economy).	奇怪的是，人们 — — 特别是中国人 — — 似乎都忘了二十年来日本一直静静地旁观着中国的崛起（甚至起着支持作用，自邓小平采取改革开放政策以来，三十年里日本投资者向中国投资了数十亿美元 ） 。
Indeed, Abe has succeeded so well in returning Japan to the world stage that his US and Asian critics act as if the only problem now is to moderate Japanese self-confidence – a notion that would have been laughable just two years ago.	事实上，安倍晋三在让日本回归世界舞台方面做得十分成功，就连他的美国和亚洲批评者似乎也认为现在唯一的问题是如何抑制日本的自信心 — — 换做两年前，这样的观点还显得颇为可笑。
But the fact remains that one of Abe’s primary worries is the spiritual malaise that accompanied Japan’s long economic stagnation.	但事实依然是安倍晋三首先要担心伴随日本长期经济停滞而生的精神不振。
Those who see in his patriotic rhetoric a desire to whitewash history miss his real concern: economic revival is meaningless if it does not secure Japan’s position as a leading Asian power.	认为安倍晋三的爱国言论是为了洗白历史是错判了他的关注点：如果不能保证日本作为亚洲���先国家的地位，那么经济即使复苏了也没有意义。
The US, however, regards Abe’s worries about Japan’s spirit as peripheral to its efforts to forge a lasting relationship with China and overhaul its strategic presence in the Pacific.	但是，美国将安倍晋三对日本精神的担忧视为次要因素，而把构建它和中国的持续关系以及改观其在太平洋的战略面貌作为首要目标。
For example, the US views the Trans-Pacific Partnership – the huge trade agreement involving it, Japan, and 10 other leading Pacific Rim countries – as a technical scheme that will bring economic benefits through greater trade.	比如，美国把跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（Trans-Pacific Partnership，TPP，包括美国、日本和其他十个环太平洋国家在内的大型贸易协定）视为一项通过贸易给经济带来好处的技术安排。
But, for Abe, the TPP’s value for Japan’s sense of identity – that it is now a more outward-looking nation – is just as important.	但是，对安倍晋三来说，TPP对日本作为一个更加外向的国家的身份感的价值也同样重要。
In Abe’s view, Japan needs to regain, wherever possible, the right of independent decision-making if it is to manage successfully the challenge posed to it by China.	在安倍晋三看来，日本需要尽一切可能重新实现独立决策，这样才能成功地应对中国带来的挑战。
This does not mean that Abe’s Japan will become an ally like France under Jacques Chirac, spurning US leadership for the sake of it; instead, Abe seeks a policy of cooperation with the US that reflects the alliance's voluntary nature.	这并不意味着安倍晋三的日本会变成像希拉克治下的法国那样的盟友并敦促美国为了它而担起领导之责；相反，安倍晋三寻求反映自愿原则的与美国合作的政策。
He believes that, given the new balance of power in Asia, the alliance will be meaningful only if each partner has a real choice, and the wherewithal, to act autonomously or with regional allies.	他认为，在亚洲新实力平衡的环境下，美国和日本都必须拥有自主或与地区盟友联合行动的真正的选择权和手段，惟其如此，联盟才会有意义。
Fortunately, Japanese and American analyses of Chinese trends are not very different.	幸运的是，日本和美国对中国趋势的分析并无多少不同。
Both generally view China as having embarked on a probing strategy in search of weak spots where it can expand its geopolitical reach.	总体而言，两国都认为中国采取的是试探战略，寻找其可以扩张地缘政治影响的薄弱点。
And both believe that only when China is convinced that such probes will yield no lasting benefit can serious negotiations about a comprehensive security structure for Asia take place.	两国也都认为，只有中国相信这样的试探战略起不了持续性的效果，亚洲才有可能展开全面安全结构的严肃谈判。
But even here, there is a difference.	但即使在这方面也仍然存在一个不同点。
The US, convinced of the importance of intentions in the conduct of foreign policy, believes that once China recognizes the limits to its power, a structure of peace will follow naturally.	美国认为在外交政策中，意图是一个很重要的因素，它相信，只要中国认识到其实力的极限在哪里，就会自然而然地产生和平结构。
Abe, by contrast, believes that only a favorable balance of power can be relied upon, and he is determined that Japan play its part in constructing that balance.	相反，安倍晋三相信，只有有利的实力平衡才是可靠的，他决心要让日本在构建这一平衡上起作用。
Although Abe has lifted Japan’s sights and self-confidence, he recognizes that Japan faces real limits.	尽管安倍晋三提升了日本的视界和自信，但他也承认日本面临现实的局限。
The US, too, should recognize that there are limits to the extent of the subordination that it can ask of an ally.	美国也明白，其盟友对其的屈从是有限度的。
Some wishes really are better left unfulfilled.	一些愿望还是不要实现的好。
	
Securing Japan	保护日本
TOKYO – Shinzo Abe’s second term as Japan’s prime minister began with a laser-like focus on economic revitalization.	东京—安倍晋三的第二次日本首相生涯以激光式地聚焦于经济复兴开始。
That policy, almost instantly dubbed “Abenomics,” comprises what have been called the three “arrows”: bold monetary policy, an expansionary fiscal stance, and structural reforms to stimulate private investment.	这一几乎从一开始就被称之为“安倍经济学”的政策由所谓的三 “支箭”组成：积极的货币政策、扩张的财政立场以及刺激私人投资的结构性改革。
Hosting the Olympic Games in Tokyo in 2020 has added a fourth arrow to this quiver in the form of increased infrastructure investment and tourism revenue in the years leading up to the Games.	东京举办2020年奥运会又在其上增加了第四支箭 — — 奥运会之前的基础设施投资和旅游收入增长。
To be sure, after 15 years of deflationary recession, revitalization of the Japanese economy remains far from complete.	坦白说，在经历了15年的通缩性衰退后，日本经济的复苏仍有很长的路要走。
Nonetheless, the effects of Abe’s reforms are becoming visible in areas such as equity prices and exchange rates.	尽管如此，安倍改革的效果已经在股市和汇率等领域开始显现。
But Abe also confronts a security environment in Asia that is every bit as brittle as Japan’s economy was before his government took office last December.	但安倍还面临着亚洲安全环境问题，这一问题之棘手一点都不亚于安倍去年12月成为首相时面临的经济问题。
Indeed, he confronted many of the same issues during his first administration seven years ago.	事实上，他面临着诸多与七年前首次出任首相时相同的问题。
His efforts back then were halted by his own resignation, and he is now making a second attempt to establish a national-security governance system to meet Japan’s needs – and those of its allies – in twenty-first-century Asia.	当时，他的措施因为他自身的辞职而夭折，而如今他要第二次试图建立能满足日本（以及盟友）在21世纪亚洲所需要的国家安全治理体系。
In a speech to a plenary session of the lower house of Japan’s Diet on October 25, Abe emphasized that, given the current security situation in Asia, “It is essential to strengthen command functions for implementing the prime minister’s national security policy.”	在10月25日日本下议院全体会议讲话中，安倍晋三强调，考虑到目前亚洲安全局势 ， “ 加强指挥功能对于落实首相国家安全政策至关重要 。 ”
Now that split control of the Diet’s upper and lower houses has been resolved, with Abe’s Liberal Democrats in strong control of both chambers, a bill to modernize Japan’s national-security governance is certain to pass.	如今，对日本国会上下议院控制权分裂的情况已不复存在，安倍的自民党牢牢控制着两院，因此现代化日本国家安全治理的法案肯定将获得通过。
The bill that Abe has submitted aims to establish a Japanese National Security Council, based on lessons from the successes and failures of similar institutions in other countries, such as the NSC in the United States.	安倍晋三所提交的法案旨在成立日本国家安全委员会（Japanese National Security Council，NSC ） ， 该委员会将综合参考其他国家类似机构（如美国的国家安全委员会）的成败经验组建。
The Security Council of Japan – something of a stopgap measure created to provide advice from relevant cabinet members to the prime minister in times of crisis – will now be reorganized as a formal institution.	日本安全委员会（Security Council of Japan，在危机期间由相关内阁成员向首相提供建议的权宜性设置）将被重组为正式机构。
The new NSC’s membership will be limited to the prime minister, the cabinet secretary, and the foreign and defense ministers, with relevant ministers added on an ad hoc basis.	新的NSC成员将限制在首相、内阁官房长官、外相和防相，必要时还将纳入相关大臣。
A permanent National Security Secretariat, headed by a person with abundant diplomatic experience, will be established in the prime minister’s office, with 60 security specialists from various fields laying the policy groundwork for medium- and long-term national security strategy.	首相办公室将常设一个国家安全秘书处，由外交经验丰富的人员充当首脑，并包括60名各个领域安全专家，他们将制定中长期国家安全战略的政策框架。
This strategy will then be reflected in guidelines issued to Japan’s defense bodies and diplomats.	接着，该战略将被制作成指导原则发给日本防务和外交机构。
Japan, like other countries, has faced jurisdictional disputes among foreign-policy, defense, and police agencies that have hindered the aggregation and analysis of intelligence information.	与其他国家一样，日本也面临着外交政策、防务和政策机构之间的管辖权限范围之争，妨碍了情报的汇总和分析。
But, with the creation of the NSC, each ministry and agency will report important national-security information to the new secretariat, which will then carry out integrated analysis and issue reports to the prime minister and others.	但是，随着NSC的组建，各省和各机构将向新的秘书处报告重要国家安全情报，由后者进行综合分析，写成报告呈送首相和各部门。
Of course, as in other countries, bureaucracies are creatures of habit.	当然，与其他国家一样，官僚主义是一种痼疾。
As we can already see, it will not be easy to overcome the obstacles posed by vertically integrated ministries and agencies.	正如我们已经看到的，克服垂直整合的省和机构所带来的障碍绝非易事。
Institutionalization will take time – and the importance of its success cannot be understated.	制度化需要时间，并且决不能低估其成功的重要性。
For example, the new NSC will be responsible for sharing intelligence with other countries, including the US, Japan’s most important ally.	比如，新的NSC将负责与其他国家（包括日本最重要盟友美国）共享情报。
As a result, ensuring the protection of information will be a key issue, particularly given the old habit of leaking security information to the press.	因此，确保情报得到保护将是关键问题，特别是在考虑到有将安全情报泄漏给媒体的陋习的情况下。
That is why the Diet is also considering a bill on the protection of classified information that would impose harsher punishment on government officials who leak secrets, particularly those concerning national security.	这就是国会同时也在考虑保密情报保护法的原因。 该法将对泄漏机密、特别是事关国家安全的机密的政府官员课以更加严厉的惩罚。
The trauma of gag laws that were imposed on the press before and during World War II resulted in the elimination of all restraints afterwards, which had the effect of making Japan a spy’s paradise, with insufficient counterintelligence measures and poor secrecy.	在二战之前和之间所实施的限制言论自由的法律所造成的创伤使得战后取消了所有的言论约束，这让日本成了间谍的天堂，反间谍手段和保密性严重不足。
Moreover, the long decades of peace since 1945 have served to lower awareness among politicians of the need for confidentiality.	此外，自1945年以来，和平已经持续了好几十年，这降低了政客的保密意识。
For example, Japanese newspapers always report when, where, and with whom the Prime Minister met for dinner in the following day’s editions.	比如，日本报纸总是在第二天就报��首相在几点钟、哪里和谁共进了一次晚餐。
In contrast to the US system of presidential government, Japan has a parliamentary form of government.	与美国政府的总统制相反，日本政府是议会制。
Yet the goals of national security and crisis management are the same in both systems – indeed, one of British Prime Minister David Cameron’s first acts when he came to power was to establish an NSC to improve coordination of policymaking.	但这两套制度的国家安全和危机管理目标是一致的 — — 事实上，英国首相卡梅伦在当选后的第一批动作之一便是成立NSC以改进决策协调。
Although the establishment of the Japanese NSC is long overdue, it is not too late for Japan to benefit from the improvement in policy direction and coherence that it seems certain to bring.	尽管日本NSC长期缺位，但对日本来说，现在成立NSC、获得它几乎必将带来的政策方向和一致性改进为时未晚。
	
How to End an Insurgency	怎样结束起义
TOKYO – When the Moro Islamic Liberation Front guerrilla movement took up arms in the Philippines in the 1960’s, Ferdinand Marcos had yet to become the country's president – let alone dictator.	东京—20世纪60年代，当莫洛伊斯兰解放阵线（Moro Islamic Liberation Front，简称MILF）游击队在菲律宾揭竿而起时，费迪南德·马科斯（Ferdinand Marcos）还没有成为总统，更不用说变成独裁者了。
Despite the country’s many political transformations in the last half-century, the MILF’s campaign to achieve independence for the Bangsamoro nation – whose territory, they claim, covers the islands of Mindanao, Palawan, Sulu, and Sabah – remained constant, until President Benigno Aquino III resolved to change it.	尽管在过去五十年中，菲律宾发生了许多政治变化，但追求邦萨摩洛（Bangsamoro）国家独立的MILF运动一直在继续进行 — — 其领土主张包括苏禄、棉兰老、巴拉望和沙巴诸岛 — — 直到总统阿基诺三世决心改变这一情况。
The MILF was not deterred by the popular overthrow of Marcos’s 20-year dictatorship in 1986, following the assassination of the opposition leader Benigno Aquino, Jr.	MILF并没有因为1986年继反对派领袖小贝尼诺·阿基诺（Benigno Aquino, Jr . ） 遇刺而起的群众推翻马科斯20年独裁统治事件而有所退缩。
Nor did the establishment of democracy – now deeply entrenched – inspire the group’s leaders to reconsider their approach.	现已深入民心的民主制度的建立也没有促使MILF领导人反思其方针。
The MILF remained engaged in a brutal campaign of beheadings, assassination, kidnappings, and indiscriminate butchery.	MILF仍然保持斩首、刺杀、绑架和无差别屠杀的野蛮政策。
Then, last January, Aquino managed to achieve a landmark deal that finally ended Mindanao’s agony.	接着，在去年1月，阿基诺三世成功地实现了终结棉兰老岛痛苦局面的里程碑式的协议。
This is one of the most remarkable feats of peacemaking in Asia since World War II, and at least as worthy of international recognition as former Finnish President and 2008 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Marti Ahtissari’s role in brokering peace in Aceh, Indonesia, in 2005.	这是自第二次世界大战以来亚洲所取得的最令人瞩目的和平协议，其价值绝不亚于前芬兰总统、2008年诺贝尔和平奖获得者马提·阿赫蒂萨里（Marti Ahtissari）在2005年印尼亚齐省和平中的调停作用。
In fact, given the myriad security and political risks that Aquino ran in concluding a peace deal with the MILF, he may be an even worthier Nobel laureate.	事实上，考虑到阿基诺三世在与MILF达成和平协议中所需要面临的安全和政治风险，他更有资格获得诺贝尔奖。
Aquino’s approach to the negotiations reflected his recognition that the MILF had twice used peace talks – once brokered by Libya’s Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi – as a cynical ploy to buy time to regroup and raise funds (including from Al Qaeda). With freshly restocked arsenals, they would relaunch their campaign to seize Mindanao by force.	阿基诺三世在谈判中所采取的方针反映出他对MILF的清醒认识 — — MILF两次利用和平谈判的机会 — — 其中一次是由利比亚的卡扎菲撮合的 — — 获得喘息，重新组织人手和筹集资金（包括来自基地组织的资金 ） ， 接着再凭借重新获得的武装重新试图武力夺取棉兰老岛。
Against this background, it is no surprise that, when Aquino relaunched stalled peace talks in 2012, the Filipino people were highly skeptical.	在这样的背景下，毫不奇怪，当2012年阿基诺三世重启陷入停滞的和平谈判时，菲律宾人对此十分怀疑。
But, over time, the effort gained credibility.	但是，随着时间的推移，阿基诺三世的努力取得了信誉。
Though questions about the peace agreement’s durability remain, with full disarmament yet to take place, the political autonomy granted to the country’s Muslim areas seems to have persuaded most MILF fighters that the time has come to end the carnage.	尽管和平协议能维持多久仍然存疑，MILF也没有完全放弃武装，但授予菲律宾穆斯林地区政治自治权似乎已经让大部分MILF战士认为是时候结束杀戮了。
For the people of Mindanao, this is a life-changing development.	对棉兰老人民来说，这是一个改变生命的变局。
In the few short months since the peace deal was reached, Filipino and foreign investment has been flowing into the island.	自和平协议达成以来的几个月里，菲律宾和外国投资持续流入棉兰老岛。
With nearly half of Mindanao’s population living below the poverty line, these funds could not be more critical.	棉兰老岛人口有近一半生活在贫困线以下，因此这笔流入可谓无比重要。
But the benefits of Aquino’s leadership are not limited to Mindanao.	但获得阿基诺三世领导力好处的并不只有棉兰老岛。
His entire presidency, which began in 2010, has been characterized by the creativity and doggedness that made peace with the MILF possible.	在2010年开始的总统生涯中，他以创新和顽强使得与MILF的和平成为可能。
Whereas other Filipino leaders – including Aquino’s mother, Corazon Aquino, who was elected president after Marcos’s overthrow – spoke out against corruption, Aquino has attacked it at its roots.	其他菲律宾领导人 — — 包括阿基诺三世之母、在推翻马科斯后当选为总统的柯拉蓉·阿基诺（Corazon Aquino）在内 — — 只是口头反腐，而阿基诺三世直击腐败的根源。
He has brought to justice not only small-time wrongdoers – or “flies,” as Chinese President Xi Jinping’s calls such people – but also “tigers” like Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, who helped overthrow Marcos and bring Corazon Aquino to power two decades ago.	他不但将位卑权小的犯错者 — — 即中国国家主席习近平所谓的“苍蝇”送上法庭，也没有放过参议员胡安·旁斯·恩里莱（Juan Ponce Enrile）这样的“老虎 ” 。 二十年前，恩里莱在推翻马科斯和柯丽蓉·阿基诺问鼎权力过程中立下过汗马功劳。
As a result, the Philippines has dramatically improved its ranking in Transparency International’s annual corruption index, rising from a 134th-place tie with Nigeria in 2010, to 94th place, alongside India, last year.	而菲律宾也得以大大提高了其在透明国际（Transparency International）年度腐败排行榜上的排名，从 2010年的134名（与尼日利亚相当）上升到去年的第94名（与印度并列 ） 。
Aquino’s efforts to fight corruption and rebuild his country’s economic foundations has enabled the Philippines – at long last – to become Southeast Asia’s fastest-growing economy, with annual GDP growth of 7.2% last year.	阿基诺三世打击腐败、重建国家经济基础的努力让菲律宾在多年后终于成为东南亚增长最快的经济体，去年GDP增长率达到了7.2 % 。
While growth is expected to slow slightly this year, to 6.5%, the Philippines can now be counted among Asia’s “tiger” economies.	尽管今年增长率预计将略有放缓（6.5%左右）但仍可以名列亚洲“小龙”行列。
Of course, the country still has a long way to go.	当然，菲律宾仍有很长的路要走。
Some ten million Filipinos – one-quarter of the workforce ­– ­are compelled to seek employment overseas, owing to inadequate opportunities at home.	一千万菲律宾人 — — 相当于劳动力的四分之一 — — 被迫远赴海外寻找工作，因为国内机会太少。
If the Philippines is to attract enough investment to achieve living standards comparable to Malaysia and Thailand, Aquino must remain persistent in his efforts to open the economy and curtail corruption.	如果菲律宾想要吸引足够的投资以实现与马来西亚和泰国相当的生活水平，阿基诺三世就必须在任期内继续开放经济和打���腐败的政策。
Fortunately, he seems determined to do so.	幸运的是，他似乎也决心要这样做。
Aquino’s foreign policy has also been characterized by the same resoluteness.	阿基诺三世的外交政策也带有同样的决心。
Nowhere is this more apparent than in his willingness to stand up to China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea.	最能说明这一点的莫过于他坚定抵制中国在南海的领土助长。
Indeed, the Philippines is challenging China’s claims in the International Court of Arbitration, using provisions from the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.	事实上，菲律宾正在援引联合国海洋法公约（Convention on the Law of the Sea）向国际仲裁法院起诉中国。
Aquino’s stern criticism of China’s expansionist policies has certainly not endeared him to the Chinese.	阿基诺三世对中国扩张主义政策的严厉批评当然让中国人十分不欢迎。
But regional powers like the United States and Japan have supported his stance, with Japan promising to deliver enhanced equipment for the Philippine Coast Guard.	但美国和日本等地区大国都支持他的立场，日本还承诺为菲律宾海岸警卫队提供加强装备。
And the Filipino people undoubtedly appreciate his tenacity in protecting their interests.	菲律宾人民毫无疑问也很欣赏他在捍卫国家利益上的坚定。
Aquino’s success in bringing the decades-old MILF rebellion to a peaceful end highlights a courage and tenacity that will enable him to play a key role in reining in China’s regional ambitions.	阿基诺三世成功地将维持了几十年的MILF起义引向和平结束，这充分表现出令他能够在遏制中国地区野心中扮演关键角色的勇气和韧性。
Just as David’s ingenuity enabled him, against all odds, to defeat Goliath, Aquino’s bold and calculated leadership can succeed in bolstering stability and security throughout Asia by bringing China, perhaps against its will, into a rules-based regional order.	正如大卫（David）的巧思让他能够破除万难战胜歌利亚（Goliath ） ， 阿基诺三世有勇有谋的领导也能够对中国敲山震虎，从而促进整个亚洲的稳定与安全。
	
Japan’s Russian Dilemma	日本的俄罗斯困境
TOKYO – For Japanese leaders and citizens, President Vladimir Putin’s brutal annexation of Crimea was an unsurprising return to the normal paradigm of Russian history.	东京—对日本领导人和日本人民来说，普京总统的悍然吞并克里米亚只不过是对俄罗斯历史常规范式的正常回归。
Indeed, most Japanese regard the move as having been determined by some expansionist gene in Russia’s political DNA, rather than by Putin himself or the specifics of the Ukraine crisis.	事实上，大部分日本人这一举动是由存在于俄罗斯政治DNA中的扩张主义基因决定的，而不是由普京本人或乌克兰危机的具体环境决定的。
Japan is particularly concerned with Russian expansionism, because it is the only G-7 country that currently has a territorial dispute with Russia, which has occupied its Northern Territories since the waning days of World War II.	日本特别担心俄罗斯的扩展主义，因为日本是七国集团中唯一目前与俄罗斯存在领土纠纷的国家，自二战末期以来，北方四岛便一直由俄罗斯占领。
That occupation began between August 28 and September 5, 1945, when the Soviet Union hurriedly nullified the existing Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty and invaded not only Japanese-occupied Manchuria, but also southern Sakhalin Island and the ancient Japanese territories of Etorofu Island, Kunashiri Island, Shikotan Island, and the Habomai Islands.	其占领史始于1945年8月28日至9月5日期间，当时苏联匆忙撕毁苏日中立条约，不但入侵了日占满洲，还攻占了库页岛南部和日本固有领土择捉岛、国后岛、色丹岛和齿舞群岛。
Concerned that America’s development and use of atomic weapons against Japan would deprive the Soviet Union of any territorial gains in the east, Stalin ordered the Red Army to invade.	由于担心美国开发和对日本动用原子弹将导致苏联在东线获得领土尽失，斯大林下令红军入侵。
But Japan, having already endured the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, had accepted the Potsdam Declaration on August 14, meaning that the war was already over when the Red Army marched in.	但已在广岛和长崎经历了两次原子弹轰炸的日本在8月14日接受了波茨坦公告，这意味着在红军开进时，战争已经结束了。
Since then, these islands have been controlled by either the Soviet Union or its successor state, Russia.	至此以后，这些岛屿一直被苏联及其继承国俄罗斯控制。
And, as elsewhere in Russia, their residents have been impoverished by consistently incompetent and corrupt government, whether run by Communists or today’s crony capitalists.	和俄罗斯的其他地区一样，这些岛屿上的居民因为无能和腐败的政府而遭受着贫穷，不管统治者是以前的共产党还是今天的权贵资本家。
In a strange historical twist, given the Crimean annexation, after the Japanese citizens native to the Northern Territories were killed or expelled, many Ukrainians were brought to the islands during the Soviet years, and still live there.	这是一个奇怪的历史扭曲。 在日本北方四岛被占领后，岛上的日本原住民或者被杀，或者被逐，而许多乌克兰人在苏联时代移民到这些岛上，至今仍生活在那里。
If an independence referendum were to be held on Etorofu Island, where some 60% of the inhabitants have roots in Ukraine, I wonder whether Putin would accept the result as readily as he did the ballot in Crimea, undertaken at the barrel of a gun?	而现在，克里米亚也被吞并了。 如果在乌克兰裔居民占60%的择捉岛举行独立公投，我怀疑普京还能不能像接受拿枪顶着的克里米亚公投结果那样踌躇满志。
After coming to power at the end of 2012, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had sought to improve relations with Putin in the hope of beginning serious talks on the Northern Territories.	自2012年底执政以来，日本首相安倍晋三一直在寻求改善与普京的关系，希望开启关于北方四岛的严肃谈判。
But now that Putin has made his project of imperial restoration crystal clear, those hopes are stillborn.	但如今普京的重建帝国工程已是人所共知，安倍的希望也已胎死腹中。
Recognizing this, Abe condemned the annexation of Crimea, calling it “a violation of Ukraine’s integrity and the integrity of its sovereignty and territory.”	认识到这一点，安倍谴责了对克里米亚的吞并，称之“破坏了乌克兰统一和主权和领土完整 ” 。
Abe added that “attempts to change the status quo by force cannot be overlooked,” and that Japan would consider further economic sanctions against Russia in cooperation with the G-7.	安倍还说 ， “ 用武力改变现状的企图决不可忽视 ” ， 日本将考虑与七国集团合作进一步对俄罗斯实施经济制裁。
Needless to say, these remarks underscored the fact that Japanese territory and territorial waters are being threatened “by force” in the East China Sea by China.	不消说，这一评论遥相呼应了一个事实：日本在东海的领土和领海正在被中国“武力”威胁。
The lesson now being drawn is that, where territorial disputes are concerned, Japan must not kowtow to “attempts to change the status quo backed by force.”	现在的教训是，在领土纠纷问题上，日本决不可屈服于“用武力改变现状的企图 ” 。
China’s response to the crisis in Ukraine was particularly revealing.	中国对乌克兰危机的反应很能说明问题。
For three decades, China has proclaimed “non-interference” in the internal affairs of sovereign states as the most important rule governing international relations.	三十年来，中国一直强调“不干预”主权国家内部事务是最重要的国际关系准则。
But when Putin invaded Ukraine, China showed the hollowness of its adherence to this principle. Instead of condemning Russia for invading and annexing Crimea, it abstained at the United Nations Security Council, and has offered more criticism of Ukraine’s new popular government than it has of Putin’s thuggish behavior.	但中国并没有谴责俄罗斯入侵并吞并克里米亚，而是在联合国安理会投了弃权票，更多地批评乌克兰新选出的政府而不是普京的暴行。
Every country in Asia is bound to draw only one conclusion from China’s tacit approval of Putin’s Crimean land grab: China, too, thinks that might makes right, and if it believes that it can get away with invading disputed territories, whether in the South China Sea or in the Indian Himalayas, it will do so.	每一个亚洲国家从中国对普京吞并克里米亚领土的默认中只能得出一个结论：中国也认为这是正确的，并且如果它认为可以侥幸成功地入侵纠纷领土时 — — 不管是南海还是印度喜马拉雅地区 — — 它也会这么做。
As a result, effective deterrence will require Asian countries to strengthen their defenses and unite to demand adherence to international law, so that China understands that any Putin-style land grabs will cost its economy dearly.	因此，有效的威慑要求亚洲国家加强防务，并团结起来要求遵守国际法，从而让中国明白，普京使的领土掠夺将付出沉重的经济代价。
In the immediate future, Japan will work with the G-7 to ensure that Putin’s reckless ambitions do not endanger other parts of Ukraine.	眼下，日本将继续与七国集团合作，确保普京的野蛮野心不会威胁到乌克兰的其他部分。
Already, Japan has decided to provide ¥150 billion ($1.5 billion) in economic aid for Ukraine, the largest pledge by any individual country, including the US, thus far.	日本已经决定向乌克兰提供1,500亿日元的经济援助，这是到目前为止包括美国在内的最大一笔单国援助承诺。
Before the Crimea invasion, territorial negotiations between Japan and Russia showed signs of progress.	在入侵克里米亚前，日本和俄罗斯的领土谈判表现出进展信号。
Moreover, several bilateral economic cooperation efforts, such as projects involving liquefied natural gas, were moving forward.	此外，一些双边经济合作计划，如与��化天然气有关的项目也在推进。
But it is now clear not only that Putin is returning Russia to the stagnation of the late-Soviet era, but also that he subscribes to former Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev’s dictum that “what we have, we hold.”	但如今，显然不仅普京让俄罗斯回到了苏联末期的停滞时期，并且他还在按照前苏联领导人勃列日涅夫的“我们有的就要捍卫”的格言行事。
So Putin’s talk about reaching an agreement with Japan on the Northern Territories was likely as mendacious as his claims that Russians in Crimea were in peril, and thus in need of protection by Russian troops.	因此，普金所谓的与日本就北方四岛达成协议完全是个谎言，一如他宣称克里米亚的俄罗斯族面临着危险因此需要派遣俄罗斯军队予以保护。
More important, Japan understands that business as usual with an aggressive Russia that undermines the international order could embolden others closer to home to embrace Putin’s lawless tactics.	更重要的是，日本明白，像什么都没发生过一样继续正常与破坏了国际秩序的俄罗斯打交道将让更近的近邻效仿普京目无法律的做法。
The days of an inward looking Japan are over.	对日本来说，向内看的时期已经结束了。
Japan now sees threats elsewhere in the world in the context of its own security, and will react appropriately.	现在，日本在其自身安全环境中看到了来自世界其他地方的威胁，并将采取相应行动。
	
Abenomics’ Women Problem	安倍经济学的妇女问题
TOKYO – When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe addressed the United Nations General Assembly last week, he emphasized his determination to build a society in which women shine.	东京—在上周的联合国大会演讲中，日本首相安倍晋三强调了建设让妇女放出光芒的社会的决心。
Indeed, creating opportunities for women in the workforce is an essential pillar of the government’s reform program, so-called “Abenomics.”	事实上，为参与劳动力大军的妇女创造机会是日本政府的改革方案，即所谓的“安倍经济学 ” （ Abenomics）的重要支柱。
Abe is clearly on the right track.	显然，安倍的方向是正确的。
According to an analysis by researchers at Goldman Sachs, closing the gender gap could boost GDP by 9% in the United States and nearly 13% in Japan.	根据高盛（Goldman Sacks）研究人员的分析，缩小性别差异将给美国带来9%的GDP提振，给日本则能带来13 % 。
During his stay in New York, Abe also discussed “womenomics” with Hillary Clinton, who had made empowering women in the economy a key policy goal during her tenure as US Secretary of State.	在纽约之行期间，安倍也与希拉里·克林顿讨论了“妇女经济学 ” 。 在担任美国国务卿期间，希拉里·克林顿将加强妇女在经济中的地位作为一项重要政策目标。
Abe, strange to say, is the first Japanese leader to grasp that the underutilization of women’s skills has been holding back Japan’s economy.	说来令人奇怪，安倍是第一个认识到妇女技能利用不足一直在拖累日本经济的日本领导人。
Japan ranked 105th out of 136 countries in the World Economic Forum’s “Global Gender Gap Report 2013,” down from 101st place in 2012.	在世界经济论坛（World Economic Forum）的《2013年全球性别差异报告 》 （ Global Gender Gap Report 2013）中，日本名列136个国家的第150位，较2012年的第101位有所下降。
The problem begins in Abe’s own domain – politics.	问题起始于安倍自己的领域 — — 政治。
In his cabinet reshuffle earlier this month, five female ministers were appointed, but in the face of strong opposition from male MPs.	在其本月重新改组的内阁中，有五名女性大臣被任命，但这一决定受到了男性国会议员的强烈反对。
More important, the appointments amounted to painting over the cracks: Only 39 of the 480 members of the Japanese Diet’s lower house, or 7.9%, are women.	更重要的是，此次任命有欲盖弥彰的嫌疑：在日本众议院的480个议席中，只有39个（或7.9 % ） 为妇女。
The Inter-Parliamentary Union ranks Japan 158th out of 189 countries in terms of its ratio of female MPs.	从妇女占议员总数比例看，日本名列国际议会联盟（Inter-Parliamentary Union）189个国家的第158位。
Things are just as bad at lower levels of government, where women account for a mere 13.1% of representatives in local parliaments, more than 40% of which have no female members at all.	低级别政府的情况也一样糟糕，妇女只占地方议会代表的13.1 % ， 有40%的选区一名妇女议员都没有。
As the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, Abe should instruct local party branches to choose more female candidates to run in next April’s local elections.	作为自民党领袖，安倍应该要求地方党分支选择更多妇女候选人参加明年4月的地方选举。
But, at least so far, Abe seems to lack the will to do so (though he may choose to work with local party bosses behind the scenes to bring in more women).	但是，至少到目前为止，安倍似乎没有这样做的意愿（尽管他可能与地方党组织领导人达成幕后交易，提拔更多女性 ） 。
It is also worrying that some of the women Abe has selected for his cabinet and for key party posts are arch-conservatives who advocate that women stay at home and take care of children.	另一个令人担心之处是一些被安倍选为内阁成员和党内重要职务人选的妇女是极端保守派，认为妇女应该呆在家里带孩子。
Given this, one cannot help feeling uncertain about the credibility of his womenomics initiatives.	基于此，我们无法不对其妇女经济学计划的可信性产生疑问。
That is especially true when one considers the lack of women in corporate management positions.	考虑到妇女在公司管理职位上的劣势，这一点更加明显了。
Everyone at the meeting of the Keidanren, the Federation of Economic Organizations, to welcome US Ambassador Caroline Kennedy were men in dark suits.	出席经团联会议欢迎美国大使卡洛琳·肯尼迪（Caroline Kennedy）的清一色都是男性。
In 2003, Norway revised its corporation law to state that companies that failed to place women in 40% of management positions could face delisting.	2003年，挪威修改了其公司法，管理岗位妇女比例不到40%的公司将可能面临摘牌下市的风险。
If the same law were applied to Japan today, every company would be delisted.	如果今天日本也采取相同的法律，那么所有公司都得摘牌下市。
Women currently hold an estimated 9% of senior management positions in Japan, compared to 40% in the Philippines, 24% in France, and 22% in the United States.	据估计，目前妇女只占日本高级管理职位的9 % ， 而菲律宾为40 % ， 法国为24 % ， 美国为22 % 。
One reason that Japan’s consumer electronics manufacturers are no longer world-beaters is that they have not fully used their female employees in managerial positions, despite their varied experiences.	日本消费电子产品制造商不再能够执世界之牛耳的一个原因就在于它们没有充分利用管理岗位上的妇女员工，尽管她们拥有丰富的经验。
The exceptions are instructive.	例外最具有说明性。
When Akira Matsumoto became CEO of the Japanese snack manufacturer Calbee, he began appointing both female executives and foreigners to the company’s leadership.	松本彰（Akira Matsumoto）成为日本快餐公司卡鲁比（Calbee）CEO后，任命女性高管和外国人担任公司领导层。
Revenues and earnings have increased, and net sales have grown threefold.	此后，收入和利润都有所上升，净销售额翻了三倍。
Though there is no proof that the former caused the latter, Matsumoto’s commitment to lead in this area suggests that corporate dynamism may well increase with a more prominent role for women.	尽管不能证明是前者带来了后者，但松本在这方面的敢为天下先先表明，让女性扮演更加主要角色可能让公司活力大增。
Likewise, Daiwa Securities CEO Shigeharu Suzuki has appointed women as executive officers to improve sales capabilities, with promising results.	类似地，大和证券（Akira Matsumoto）CEO铃木茂晴（Shigeharu Suzuki）任命女性为公私高管以改善销售能力，结果令人欣喜。
Although the employment rate of women in Japan reached 69.5% in 2013, more than 60% of women leave the workplace prematurely, mostly owing to childbirth.	尽管2013年日本妇女就业率达到了69.5 % ， 但60%多的妇女过早退出了劳动力大军，主要原因是为了照顾孩子。
This pattern results from institutional impediments to achieving a viable work-family balance – impediments that embody the harsh view of male superiors and colleagues toward working mothers.	这一模式的根源在于阻碍视线工作-家庭平衡的制度障碍 — — 男性上司和同事对生了孩子还上班的母亲十分反感。
Changing this view is not easy, because the Confucian belief that women belong in the home remains embedded in Japanese and some other Asian societies.	改变这一观念绝不容易，因为妇女应该持家的儒家思想仍深深地植根于日本也其他一下亚洲国家。
Moreover, most of the people participating in forums or workshops focused on womenomics are women; too often, these events simply turn into platforms for women to complain among themselves.	此外，大部分参加妇女经济学论坛和讨论组的人都是妇女；这些最后往往沦为妇女之间彼此抱怨的平台。
Abe’s womenomics will not work unless and until Japanese men change their thinking.	在日本男性改变思想之前，安倍的妇女经济学不会奏效。
If Abenomics is now stalling, as many fear, the reason may be found in a lack of capacity to implement the policies put forward, particularly with respect to women.	如果现在安倍经济学如同很多人所担心的那样停滞下来，其原因或许可以从缺乏推行政策特别是妇女政策的能力。
Indeed, the key to Abenomics’ success or failure may turn out to be whether the Japanese people are convinced that women are essential to their country’s economic revival, and are willing to support an earnest effort to establish institutions that support working women.	事实上，安倍经济学成败的关键也许是日本民族是否相信妇女对这个国家的经济复兴至关重要，并愿意支持建设支持职业妇女的制度的努力。
	
Tipping Points to Asia’s Future	亚洲未来的关键点
TOKYO – A week, it is said, is a long time in politics.	东京—据说一周的时间在政治界已经算得上长期了。
But events in Asia over the past week may define the region for decades to come.	但过去一周在亚洲发生的事件可能决定着该地区的未来几十年。
Thailand, one of Asia’s most prosperous countries, seems determined to render itself a basket case.	亚洲最繁荣的国家之一泰国似乎铁了心要自断手脚。
A military coup, imposed following the Thai constitutional court’s ouster of an elected government on spurious legal grounds, can lead only to an artificial peace.	在泰国宪法法院以可疑法律依据驱逐民选政府后，军事政变只能带来人为的平衡。
Unless Thailand’s military is prepared to serve as a truly honest broker between deposed Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra (and her supporters) and the anti-democratic Bangkok elite, which has sought a right to permanent minority rule, today’s calm may give way to a new and more dangerous storm.	除非泰国军方准备充当被推翻的总理英拉（及其支持者）和反民主的曼谷精英（正在追求永久的少数派统治）之间的真诚的牵线人，否则今天的平静将让位给新的危险风暴。
To Thailand’s east, Vietnam is the latest Asian country to feel pinched by China’s policy of creating facts on the ground, or in this case at sea, to enhance its sovereignty claims on disputed territory.	泰国以东，越南是中国捏造土地事实 — — 对越南来说是海洋事实 — — 推行其在争议领土主权主张的最新的不堪忍受者。
Vietnam’s government reacted vigorously to China’s placement of a huge, exploratory oilrig near the disputed Paracel Islands in the South China Sea. Ordinary Vietnamese, taking matters into their own hands, reacted even more vigorously, by rioting and targeting Chinese industrial investments for attack.	越南政府对中国在存在争议的南海西沙群岛设置巨型钻井平台的反应非常强烈，而自力更生的普通越南人民的反应甚至更加强烈，掀起了针对中国产业投资的暴乱。
China’s unilateral behavior has exposed a strain of virulent anti-Chinese sentiment bubbling beneath the surface in many Asian countries.	中国的单方面行为将掩盖在许多亚洲国家平静表面下的汹涌的反中情绪揭开了一丝。
Renewed protests over China’s mining investments in Myanmar this week confirmed this trend, one that China’s leaders seem either to dismiss as trivial, or to regard as somehow unrelated to their bullying.	本周在缅甸发生的新一轮针对中国矿业投资的示威确认了这一趋势，而中国领导要么认为这一无关紧要，要么认为这与其恃强凌弱的行为没有什么关系。
Indeed, like Russian President Vladimir Putin, who faces widespread public antipathy in Ukraine, China’s leaders appear to believe that popular protests against them can only be the product of an American plot.	事实上，与在乌克兰饱受千夫所指的俄罗斯总统普京一样，中国领导人似乎认为针对他们的群众示威只不过是美国人煽动的产物。
Yet, despite their shared contempt for expressions of the popular will, China’s President Xi Jinping and Putin struggled, during Putin’s two-day visit to Shanghai, to agree on a new gas deal that the Kremlin desperately needs.	但是，尽管都对汹涌的群情嗤之以鼻，但中国国家主席习近平和普京仍在普京的两日上海之行中就克里姆林宫所急需的天然气合同展开了一番明争暗斗。
Putin had viewed China as his backup option should the West seek to isolate Russia following its annexation of Crimea.	普京将中国视为西方在其吞并克里米亚后寻求孤立俄罗斯时的备选项。
Putin’s idea was that he could pivot Russia’s economy into a partnership with China.	普京的算盘是他可以将俄罗斯经济的支点放在与中国的伙伴关系上。
But Xi balked, signing the gas agreement only after Putin offered a steep, long-term discount.	但习近平并不买账，在普京给出了很大的长期折扣后才签署了天然气协议。
Xi’s self-confidence reflected not only the Chinese leadership’s contempt for Putin’s mismanagement of the Russian economy, but also the fact that China’s energy worries have lessened considerably of late.	习近平的自信不但反映出中国领导层对普京治理俄罗斯经济不力的不屑，也体现了中国能源顾虑最近已大为缓解的事实。
Successful deployment of hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) technology in Xinjiang suggests that China, like America, will soon be able to draw on its own reserves of shale energy.	液压致裂法在新疆的成功应用意味着中国与美国一样，很快就将能够利用其自身的页岩能源储备。
Moreover, plentiful gas supplies from Myanmar and Central Asia will provide China with sufficient supplies of energy for at least a decade.	此外，来自缅甸和中亚的充足的天然气供应至少在十年内可以让中国没有供应短缺之忧。
China’s hard bargaining with Russia has exposed the limits of the two countries’ bilateral cooperation, which has important geo-strategic consequences for Asia and the world.	中国的强势还价暴露出两国双边合作的局限性，而这对亚洲和世界具有重要的地缘战略影响。
China, it now seems, is happy to see Putin poke his finger in the West’s eye and challenge America’s global leadership.	中国似乎乐于见到普京与西方顶牛、挑战美国的全球领导。
But it is not willing to underwrite with hard cash Russian pretensions to world power status.	但它不愿拿出真金白银支持俄罗斯的全球霸权之争。
Instead, China appears interested in turning Russia into the sort of vassal state that Putin is seeking to create in Ukraine.	相反，中国似乎更愿意让俄罗斯成为附庸国，一如普京对乌克兰的算盘。
But the most epochal events of the last week took place in two of Asia’s great democracies: India and Japan.	但上周最具划时代意义的事件发生在亚洲的两个民主大国：印度和日本。
Narendra Modi’s landslide victory in India’s general election was not only a huge personal triumph for the son of a tea seller, but may well mark a decisive break with India’s traditional inward-looking policies.	纳兰德拉·莫迪在印度大选中获得压倒性胜利，这不仅是这位茶商之子个人的辉煌胜利，也标志着印度传统内向政策的决定性突破。
Modi is determined to reform India’s economy and lead the country into the front rank of world powers.	莫迪决心改革印度经济，让印度走向世界强国前列。
Here, Modi will find no stauncher ally than Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who was among the first Asian leaders to embrace him in his bid to lead India.	在这方面，莫迪最坚定的盟友莫过于日本首相安倍晋三。 安倍晋三是最早支持莫迪领导印度的亚洲领导人之一。
Given that both countries have almost perfectly aligned regional security interests, there should be plenty of scope for the two to act in tandem to improve regional security and mutual prosperity.	两国拥有几乎完美一致的安全利益，因此有充分的空间携手并进改善地区安全、增进共同繁荣。
Thailand’s crisis might well mark a good early test of their ability to work together, because both countries have strong interests in Thailand’s rapid return to democracy and the credibility needed to act as an honest broker in ending the country’s crisis.	泰国危机或许是很好的共事能力早期测试，因为泰国迅速回归民主十分符合两国的利益，并且两国也拥有作为终结泰国危机的真诚牵线人所必须具备的信誉。
In the past week, Abe created for himself considerably more political space to act as a strategic partner, not only to India, but also to Japan’s other allies, particularly the United States.	在过去一周里，安倍为自己创造很大的以战略合作伙伴身份施展的政治空间 — — 不仅是对印度，也包括日本的其他盟国，特别是美国。
Quietly, a panel appointed by Abe’s government this week offered a reinterpretation of a key element of Article 9 of Japan’s constitution.	本周，安倍政府悄然任命的小组对日本宪法第九条的一项关键要素做出了重新解释。
For the first time since the Pacific War’s end in 1945, Japan’s Self-Defense Forces would be able to participate in “collective self-defense” – meaning that Japan could come to the aid of its allies should they come under attack.	自1945年太平洋战争以来，日本自卫队将首次能够参与“集体自卫 ” — —这意味着日本可以在盟国受到袭击是给予支援。
Of course, China and others in Asia have tried to muddy this change with the alarmist charge of a return to Japanese militarism.	当然，中国和其他亚洲国家试图阻止这一变化，它们认��这是日本回归军国主义的危险信号。
But the new interpretation of Article 9 augurs just the opposite: it embeds Japan’s military within an alliance system that has been, and will remain, the backbone of Asia’s prevailing structure of peace.	但对宪法第九条的新解释的意义与此正好相反：它将日本的军力嵌入了一个联盟体系，这一体系一直是、将来也会是亚洲和平结构的基石。
Abe will make this clear when he delivers the keynote address in Singapore at this year’s Shangri La Dialogue, the annual meeting of Asian military and civilian military leaders.	安倍将在今年新加坡香格里拉对话（Shangri La Dialogue）的政策演说中阐释这一点。 香格里拉对话是亚洲军事和文职领导人年会。
Modi’s victory and Abe’s increased ability to stand by Japan’s allies can help to forge deeper bilateral ties and, if properly understood by China, foster a greater strategic equilibrium in the region.	莫迪的胜利以及安倍与日本盟友携手能力的日增有助于深化双边关系，如果中国能够恰当地理解这一点，更有助于形成更大的地区战略均衡。
It is now possible for Asia’s greatest powers – China, India, Japan, and the US – to form something akin to the concert system that gave Europe a century of almost complete peace in the nineteenth century.	如今，亚洲地区最大的国家 — — 中国、印度、日本和美国 — — 有望形成堪与给十九世纪给欧洲带来近一百年和平的体系相媲美的合作体系。
Of course, such a system would require China to set aside its goal of regional hegemony.	当然，这样一套体系需要中国放下其地区霸权目标。
Clear-sighted Chinese must already see that, short of a victorious war, such dominance is impossible.	头脑清醒的中国人必须看到，不通过大胜仗获得这一主导权是不可能的。
Now is the moment for China to anchor its rise within a stable and mutually acceptable Asian regional order.	如今，中国应该将其崛起的基础定在稳定的、可互相接受的亚洲地区秩序上。
Indeed, for China, this may be the ultimate tipping point in its modernization.	事实上，对中国来说，这将是其现代化进程中的终极关键点。
	
The Road to Slovyansk	通往斯洛夫扬斯克之路
TOKYO – The Ukraine crisis has demonstrated that one person alone can endanger world peace.	东京—乌克兰危机表明，一个人就可以威胁到世界和平。
But that one person might not be Russian President Vladimir Putin, who in reality only leads a large regional power that, owing to his authoritarian rule and muddled economics, is a long-term threat more to itself than to the world.	但这个人或许不是俄罗斯总统普京，他其实只不过是一个地区大国的领导人，由于独裁和混乱的经济政策，对他自己的国家的威胁比世界更大。
No, the lone actor most responsible for threatening world peace might unwittingly be US President Barack Obama, with his scholarly inertia and apparent disregard for the fate of smaller, faraway countries.	不，你或许没有感觉到，最能威胁世界和平的个人乃是美国总统奥巴马，以及他的智识保守（scholarly inertia）和对遥远的小国命运的冷漠。
Of course, Obama is not responsible for Russia’s invasion and annexation of Crimea, or for Putin’s massing of Russian troops on Ukraine’s eastern border in an effort to intimidate the government in Kyiv.	当然，奥巴马不必为俄罗斯入侵和吞并克里米亚负责，也不必为普京在乌克兰东境集结俄军以恐吓基辅政府负责。
Nor is Obama alone in crafting a Western policy of appeasement by default.	奥巴马也无法单枪匹马地决定西方默认的绥靖政策。
German Chancellor Angela Merkel also bears considerable responsibility: Her tough rhetoric masks a largely business-as-usual approach that reflects her country’s dependence on Russian gas supplies.	德国总理默克尔也需要承担大量责任：她嘴上厉害，实际上实施的却是老方一帖，这体现出德国对俄罗斯天然气供应的依赖。
But Obama is responsible for his administration’s apparent indifference to the fate of the American-built order that has governed world affairs since the end of World War II.	但奥巴马需要负责的是其政府对美国所建立的秩序的冷漠。 自二战以来，这一秩序便一直决定着国际事务。
Unless he toughens his policies, the rules and norms that have guaranteed peace for so many for so long could lose their force.	除非他收紧政策，否则保障了多年和平的规则和规范可能失去约束力。
The utter disconnect between America’s diplomatic principles and practice has become so great that it is emboldening the country’s adversaries.	美国外交原则与实践之间的严重脱节已经导致美国对手胆子越来越大。
That is why, following Russia’s illegal seizure and annexation of Crimea, Putin is now trying to mold Ukraine’s eastern provinces into vassal regions, if not foment irredentism, in order to realize his dream of reconstituting the Russian empire.	正因如此，在俄罗斯非法掠夺和吞并了克里米亚后，如今普京又在觊觎将乌克兰东部省份揽为俄罗斯的附庸，甚至想煽动民族统一主义，以实现他的重铸俄罗斯帝国之梦。
But it is not only America’s rivals who are taking note of Obama’s passivity.	但并非只有美国的对手在注意奥巴马的消极。
The United States’ closest allies are also watching nervously, and the conclusions they appear to be drawing could harm its national security interests severely in the years and decades to come.	美国最紧密的盟友也在严重关注，而它们可能得到的结论将严重威胁到未来几年到几十年美国的国家安全利益。
Consider the Middle East, where Saudi Arabia is already openly questioning the reliability of the Kingdom’s historic US defense guarantee.	以中东为例。 对沙特阿拉伯已经公开质疑长期以来美国对其安全保证的可靠性。
And US Secretary of State John Kerry’s “guidance” for a settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which should have been unveiled this month, will now remain under wraps.	而本应在本月披露的美国国务卿约翰·克里对以色列-巴勒斯坦冲突和解的“指导方针”迟迟无法露面。
Speculation abounded that Kerry’s proposal would contain a specific US guarantee of Israel’s borders.	人们纷纷猜测克里的方案将包括美国对以色列边界的具体保证。
But can anyone imagine Israelis taking America at its word after watching the US dither while Russia redrew the map of Ukraine?	但以色列人在目睹了美国对俄罗斯吞并乌克兰领土默不作声后还会相信美国的保证吗？
In the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, the US, together with the United Kingdom and Russia, guaranteed Ukraine’s territorial integrity in exchange for its surrender of the large nuclear arsenal it inherited from the Soviet Union.	在1994年的布达佩斯备忘录（Budapest Memorandum）中，美国与英国和俄罗斯一起承诺保证乌克兰的领土完整，以换取后者交出其继承自苏联的庞大核武库。
Now that the US has disregarded its obligation to Ukraine – reportedly unwilling even to share intelligence with its government on Russian troop movements, much less supply the country with the means to defend itself – all bets are off concerning an American guarantee of Israel’s security and territorial integrity.	如今，美国食言了其对乌克兰的义务 — — 据说连与乌克兰政府分享关于俄军动向的情报都不愿意，更不用说为乌克兰提供自我防卫的帮助了 — — 人们为何还要相信美国对以色列安全和领土完整的保证呢。
For that matter, why should Iran discontinue its nuclear program when it sees the ease with which Ukraine was dismembered?	既然如此，在目睹了乌克兰被轻易肢解后，伊朗为何还要暂停其核计划呢？
After all, the Iranians have borne far harsher sanctions than those imposed on Russia so far.	毕竟，伊朗人所承受的制裁比目前的俄罗斯大得多。
By acquiescing in Russia’s seizure of Crimea, the US may also see core alliances begin to unravel.	默许俄罗斯侵占克里米亚的美国可能还将看到盟友开始与它渐行渐远。
For example, the US has openly stated that it will defend Japan should China forcibly seize the disputed Senkaku Islands.	比如，美国公开声明如果中国使用武力侵占争议的钓鱼岛，它将捍卫日本。
But if America can evade its guarantee of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, why should Japan’s leaders believe that it will do otherwise in the case of a far-flung cluster of uninhabited islands that are scarcely more than rocks inhabited by sheep?	但既然美国可以回避保证乌克兰领土完整的义务，日本领导人又为何要相信它会在荒无人烟、只有礁石和绵羊的的边远群岛钓鱼岛问题上区别对待呢？
US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel heard an earful of official doubt about the credibility of America’s defense commitment during his recent visit to Japan.	在最近的访日之旅中，美国国防部长查克·哈格尔已经听到了对美国防务承诺信誉的严重官方质疑。
Obama is certain to hear more of the same in Tokyo this week.	本周访问东京的奥巴马必然会听到更多相同的质疑。
Of course, the US is no longer in a position to “pay any price…to secure the survival and the success of liberty,” as John F. Kennedy put it in his inaugural address – not in Ukraine, and not anywhere else.	当然，美国已不再会如约翰·F·肯尼迪在其就职演说中所说的“不惜一切代价 … … 确保自由的生存和成功 ” — —不管是在乌克兰还是在别的地区。
The huge price of its wars in Afghanistan and Iraq has understandably made the US war-weary.	不难理解，阿富汗和伊拉克战争的巨大代价让美国有了厌战情绪。
Moreover, no country has the right to expect Americans to fight and die on its territory for its freedom.	此外，没有哪个国家有权利要求美国人在它的领土上为它的自由战斗和牺牲。
But has the US become so withdrawn from the world that it is willing to pay only a symbolic price, such as that implied by Russia’s tit-for-tat sanctions, to stop aggression that threatens the international order?	但如若美国变得不再热心于世界事务，只愿意付出象��性的代价 — — 俄罗斯的以牙还牙式的制裁就是明证 — — 来阻止威胁到国际社会的入侵会怎样？
Have America’s recent foreign wars so scarred its leaders that they are unable to defend the world order that their predecessors created and for which many Americans have died?	美国最近的对外战争让其领导人如此恐慌，以至于他们无法捍卫前辈所创造的、无数美国人为之献身的世界秩序了吗？
The time is growing short for the US to demonstrate anew – to friend and foe alike – that its word remains its bond.	留给美国重新向它的盟友和敌人证明它言出必行的时间越来越少了。
Unless Russia honors the accord recently reached in Geneva to defuse the Ukraine crisis, the US must use – and soon – its full arsenal of non-military means to demonstrate to Putin the costs, and folly, of his 1930’s-style revanchism.	除非俄罗斯尊重最近在日内瓦达成的乌克兰危机解决方案，否则美国必须使用 — — 并且立刻使用 — — 全面的非军事手段向普京证明他的20世纪30年代式的复仇主义是多么愚蠢、代价多么高昂。
The soft underbelly of Putin’s imperial ambitions is Russia’s brittle and undiversified economy, and the expectations of ordinary Russians for improved living standards.	普京的帝国野心的弱点在于俄罗斯经济的脆弱性和单一性，以及普通俄罗斯人改善生活水平的期望。
The US and the European Union need to demonstrate clearly to the Russian people that their president’s policies will mean a likely return to the poverty and tyranny of the Soviet era.	美国和欧盟需要让俄罗斯人民清楚地证明，他们的总统的政策意味着可能回到苏联时代的贫困和暴政。
Any lesser display of resolve may fatally weaken the bedrock of Western security – and that of the world.	如果不表现出坚定的决心，就有可能削弱西方 — — 以及世界 — — 安全的基础。
	
The Pyongyang Purge	平壤清洗
TOKYO – During the Cold War, the term “Kremlinology” referred to efforts to understand what was taking place at the commanding heights of the Soviet Union – indeed, behind the entire Iron Curtain.	东京—在冷战期间 ， “ 克里姆林学 ” （ Kremlinology）一词用来描述对苏联制高点内部所发生的事情的研究 — — 事实上，这需要穿透整个“铁幕 ” （ Iron Curtain ） 。
Kremlinologists monitored (in whatever way possible) who was up and who was down among the core Soviet leadership.	克里姆林学家（无所不用其极地）监控苏联核心领导层的人事升降境况。
Great significance was read into who signed an official document, or who stood where atop Lenin’s Tomb in Red Square when reviewing military parades.	谁签署了一份官方文件，谁在阅兵时站在红场列宁墓上方，这些东西的微言大义都会被深入解读。
All of that was grammar-school stuff compared to efforts to decipher the regime in North Korea, where the truth is far more opaque.	所有这些与解密朝鲜政权比起来都是小儿科。 朝鲜政坛的真相远比苏联更加波诡云谲。
Consider what happened on December 17.	以12月17日发生的事件为例。
Choe Ryong-hae, Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Korean Workers’ Party, was conspicuously present on stage at the commemoration of the second anniversary of “Dear Leader” Kim Jong-il’s death – the first major ceremony following the purge and execution of Jang Song-thaek, the former vice chairman of the National Defense Commission.	朝鲜劳动党中央军事委员会副主席崔龙海在“敬爱的领袖”金正日逝世两周年的纪念仪式上站在了显要位置。 该仪式也是前朝鲜国防委员会副主席张成泽被处决后的首次重大仪式。
Choe’s speech, with its threats against the United States and South Korea, seemed to set the stage for his political elevation.	崔龙海的演讲，以及他对美国和韩国的威胁，似乎在宣告他政治地位的抬升。
Jang Song-thaek had been seen as a kind of regent to Kim Jong-un, the young successor to the Kim family dynasty, and was thought to be number two in the regime.	张成泽被视为金氏王朝年轻继承人金正恩的摄政王，朝鲜政权的二号人物。
But he owed his position to his wife, Kim Kyong-hui, the only sister of Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-un’s deceased father.	但他的地位是由其妻、金正恩之父金正日唯一的妹妹金敬姬带来的。
Jang’s tact, as well as his usefulness as an interlocutor with China, enabled him to keep his position, despite his long-term separation from his wife.	张成泽老谋深算，并且在与中国的交往中作用显著，这让他得以保持自己的地位，尽管他与金敬姬早已分居。
But in North Korea, blood is paramount: everything, including ideology and the national interest, is subservient to the maintenance of the Kim dynasty.	但是，在朝鲜，血缘关系才压倒一切：包括意识形态和国家利益在内的所有东西都没有维持金氏王朝重要。
The “legacy” of the “Great Leader” Kim Il-sung and his son, “Dear Leader” Kim Jong-il, determines all major decisions.	“伟大领袖”金日成和“敬爱的领袖”金正日的“遗志”决定了所有重要决策。
I have long believed that the true holder of power since Kim Jong-il’s death has been his sister, Kim Kyong-hui, and no one else.	长期以来，我一直认为金正恩死后的真正掌权者没有其他人，只有他的妹妹金敬姬一人。
North Korean culture would suggest that women do not take positions of leadership, but it appears that she was the only family member whom Kim Jong-il could trust.	朝鲜文化决定了女性不能占据领袖位置，但金敬姬似乎是金正日能够信任的唯一家人。
When he was incapacitated by illness, it was she who called the shots.	金正日因病丧失行动能力时，是金敬姬招来了枪手。
Her blood tie to the Kim dynasty is the reason why, even after her husband was purged and executed (and the rest of his family rounded up), she maintained her political position.	血缘关系决定了即便丈夫遭到清洗和处决（其家人也遭到禁锢 ） ， 金敬姬仍能保持政治地位。
It has even been suggested that she made the decision to purge her husband.	甚至有消息说是她决定清洗丈夫。
Though it cannot be known whether she also proposed killing him, it is not surprising that she believed that, with her own health failing, she could not leave the family dynasty to her husband’s care.	尽管无法得知她是否还建议除掉张成泽，但健康状况日益恶化的她认为不能让金氏王朝落入其夫之手并不令人奇怪。
Perhaps the most chilling aspect of Jang’s execution is that it appears to be part of a feeding frenzy that has claimed the lives of a number of senior officials and generals.	或许处决张成泽最令人惊悚之处是这是让众多高官和将军丧命的大清洗的一部分。
And the bloodletting has been extremely personal: In August, Kim Jong-un reportedly ordered the execution by firing squad of an ex-girlfriend and other members of her musical ensemble; the killings are said to have been carried out in front of their families.	这场流血完全是个人主义的：据报道，8月份金正恩下令枪决他的一位前女友和她的乐队；据说处决是当着他们家人的面进行的。
Elsewhere in the communist world, such murderous purges were renounced long ago, first in the Soviet Union by Khrushchev, following his denunciation of Stalin, and then in China by Deng Xiaoping, following his rehabilitation and return to power in the late 1970’s.	在其他共产主义国家，如此大清洗也早已是遥远的回忆了。 首先是苏联的赫鲁晓夫在批判斯大林进行过清洗，随后，邓小平在20世纪70年代末回到权力中心后写进行了清洗。
This “reform” did not make these regimes any more beneficent or efficient, but it did bring a degree of stability and predictability to their behavior.	这一“改革”并未让这些政权更仁慈、更有效率，但确实给政权行为带来了一定程度和稳定性和可预测性。
North Korea, always the least predictable of totalitarian communist states, remains in a twilight world.	而朝鲜依然是哪个隐密王朝，是所有集权主义国家中最难预测的那个。
More disturbing is the question of whether China is going down a parallel path under President Xi Jinping.	最令人不安的问题是中国是否会在习近平治下也走上这条路。
Ever since Deng’s rule, there has been an understanding that members of the Chinese Communist Party’s Politburo are not to be touched, even in retirement.	自邓小平执政以来，一条不成文的规矩是中共政治局常委不能动，即使是退休常委也是如此。
But Xi, under the pretext of his anti-corruption battle, has targeted retired Politburo member Zhou Yongkang, who is now reportedly under house arrest, facing graft charges – and lurid allegations not only that he murdered his first wife but that he tried to assassinate Xi.	但习近平以反腐斗争为托辞将目标指向了退休政治局常委周永康。 据报道，目前周永康已被软禁，并将面临贪污指控 — — 甚至谋杀发妻甚至试图刺杀习近平这样骇人听闻的罪行。
China’s emphasis since Deng on rule by consensus may not have made the country any more democratic, but it at least prevented the re-emergence of a new cult of personality à la Mao Zedong.	自邓小平以来，中国就强调根据共识治国，这或许并没有让中国变得更加民主，但至少防止了毛泽东式个人崇拜的卷土重来。
The question today is whether Xi’s flouting of this internal party convention is another step in re-creating one-man – and thus completely arbitrary – rule in China.	现在的问题是，习近平打破党内常规的做法是否是在中国重建独夫治国 — — 从而实现彻底独裁的又一步骤。
In North Korea, of course, arbitrary rule – no matter how bizarre and inept – is always the norm.	当然，在朝鲜，独裁统治 — — 不管多么奇怪和拙劣 — — 永远是常规。
And now, with Jang purged, responsibility for economic failure in North Korea has been shifted to Choe.	现如今，随着张成泽的垮台，朝鲜经济失败的责任落在了崔龙海身上。
All officials and people related to him now live under the shadow of the executioner, for he is certain to bear the blame when the dynasty needs a scapegoat for its mounting problems.	与崔龙海有关的官员和人物无不生活在刽子手的阴影下，当金氏王朝需要给日益深重的问题寻找替罪羊时，崔龙海毫无疑问将是不二之选。
And Jang’s purge may make those problems worse.	张成泽的清洗让这些问题更加糟糕了。
While China lost a convenient point of contact with the Kim regime, North Korea may have lost the only channel by which to sustain itself.	中国失去了与金氏政权联系的方便点，但朝鲜失去的可能是维持生命的仅有渠道。
The economy cannot be revived so long as international sanctions are maintained, and the sanctions seem certain to remain in place so long as the regime continues with its nuclear brinkmanship.	如果国际制裁维持下去，朝鲜经济就无法维持，而只要金氏政权继续其核边缘政策，国际制裁肯定会维持下去。
China, which has been the Kim dynasty’s lifeline, no longer appears willing to offer it a blank check.	而作为金氏王朝生命线的中国也不再愿意向它提供空头支票了。
So the day is fast approaching when Kim Jong-un and his clan will have to take responsibility for the country’s dire condition, and it may come soon after Kim Kyong-hui dies.	因此，金正恩及其集团马上就要为朝鲜的惨状付出代价了，这可能会在金敬姬死后不久发生。
If so, the Kim dynasty’s last chapter may have begun with the current spasm of executions, though the ending – for the Korean Peninsula and East Asia alike – remains very much in doubt.	果真如此的话，金氏王朝的终章的开始就是最近的一系列处决，尽管其结局 — — 对朝鲜半岛和东亚来说 — — 仍有诸多疑点。
	
The New Neutrality	新中立
TOKYO – Throughout the Cold War, the Soviet Union used every imaginable threat and inducement – including the ultimate prize of reunification – to bring about a neutral Germany.	东京—在整个冷战期间，苏联用一切可以想象的手段 — — 包括重新统一这一终极诱惑 — — 威逼利诱中立的德国。
But German leaders of both the left and the right, from Konrad Adenauer to Willy Brandt, spurned every Soviet offer.	但不论是东德还是西德领导人，从阿登纳到勃兰特，都不为所动。
Will authoritarian mercantilism now succeed where communism failed?	在共产主义已经失败的地方，今天的极权重商主义能成功吗？
Countries join alliances, or entities such as the European Union, because these groups make the benefits and obligations of membership as unambiguous as anything in international relations can be.	国家加入联盟或欧盟这样的实体，因为组成这样的集团能让成员获得明确的好处和义务，这是任何国际关系都无法与之媲美的。
For Germany and South Korea, however, relationships with historic allies – NATO and the United States, respectively – appear to be changing before our eyes.	但是，对德国和韩国来说，与其历史盟友 — — 分别是北约和美国 — — 的关系似乎正在我们眼皮底下发生改变。
Through their huge purchases of goods, with promises of even more to come, today’s authoritarian/mercantilist regimes in Russia and China may be about to achieve by commerce what the Soviets could not achieve by bribery and threats.	今天的俄罗斯和中国极权/重商主义政权大量购买商品，并承诺在未来还会继续加码，大有以商业手段完成苏联靠贿赂和威胁无法完成的任务。
And the scale of that commerce is breathtaking, with German exports to China growing from $25.9 billion a decade ago to $87.6 billion in 2011, while South Korea’s exports have increased from $53 billion to $133 billion during the same period of time.	通商的规模令人咋舌，德国对华出口从十年前的259亿美元增长到2011年的876亿美元，而同期韩国出口从530亿美元增至1,330亿美元。
A form of stealth neutralism, indeed, appears to be entering both countries’ diplomacy.	事实上，一种隐中立形式正在进入两国外交。
Witness Chinese President Xi Jinping’s recent trip to South Korea, German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s unwillingness to impose effective sanctions on Russia for its intervention in Ukraine, and the business-only focus of her just-concluded visit to China.	如国国家主席习近平最近的韩国之行、德国总理默克尔不愿就俄罗斯干预乌克兰对后者实施有效制裁以及她在最近的访华过程中只侧重商业。
In both Germany and South Korea, the idea that historic alliances may offer fewer tangible benefits than tacit neutrality – particularly in terms of exports – appears to be taking root, especially among business elites.	在德国和韩国，历史盟友比沉默中立带来的有形好处更少（特别是用出口衡量 ） ， 这一思想已经站稳了脚跟，特别是在商业精英中间。
Xi’s visit to Seoul was another bold step in China’s systematic efforts to wean South Korea from its commitment to the US-led international economic order.	习近平对首尔的访问是中国系统性诱导韩国抛弃美国领导的国际经济秩序的新的重大举措。
By offering to permit South Korea to settle its bilateral trade accounts in renminbi, and to launch the first-ever Sino-South Korean initiative toward North Korea, Xi is seeking to convince South Korea’s leaders that the country’s future, including reunification, will be determined in Beijing.	习近平开出的条件包括允许韩国用人民币结算双边贸易账户以及开战史上首次中韩联合对朝行动，目的是让韩国领导人相信韩国的未来（包括重新统一）取决于北京。
China’s invitation to South Korea to participate in a new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (alongside other countries in Asia and the Arab world, but excluding Japan and India) furthers Xi’s efforts to create an alternative financial system, with the AIIB mimicking the Asia Development Bank’s work.	中国邀请韩国参与新的亚洲基础设施投资银行（Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank，简称AIIB其他参与方包括亚洲和阿拉伯世界，但不包括日本和印度 ） ， 这是习近平建立替代金融体系的新步骤 — — AIIB功能与亚洲开发银行相仿。
China’s embrace of South Korea is part of a long-term strategy to turn it into a subordinate state in terms of foreign and national security policy (much as Finland kowtowed to the Soviet Union throughout the Cold War).	中国拉拢韩国是其长期战略的一部分 — — 让韩国沦为外交和国家安全政策的附庸国（正如冷战期间芬兰对苏联的俯首帖耳 ） 。
And yet, though courted by all sides in the struggle to maintain stability in Northeast Asia, South Korea now runs the risk of becoming isolated.	但是，尽管在保持东北亚稳定的斗争中，韩国是各方争取的对象，但如今它却面临被孤立的危险。
Every gesture by the South toward one of the protagonists – China, the US, Japan, and North Korea – elicits so much pressure by the others that its government must then somehow devise a compensatory policy.	只要韩国向相关国家 — — 中国、美国、日本和朝鲜 — — 做出姿态，都会引起其他国家的施压，迫使韩国政府随后做出补偿性政策。
For example, following President Park Geun-hye’s request that Xi honor the Korean assassin of a Japanese prime minister, to which Xi readily agreed, she began to discuss joining the US-led Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade negotiations, in order to assuage the US.	比如，韩国总统朴槿惠要求习近平颂扬刺杀日本首相的韩国人（习近平早已准备好欣然接受 ） ， 随后又开始准备讨论加入美国领导的跨太平洋合作伙伴（Trans-Pacific Partnership）自由贸易谈判，以此讨好美国。
As China continued to pursue an anti-Japanese propaganda campaign throughout 2013, Park felt obliged to make some effort to revive ties with Japan by sending a private envoy to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to seek talks on reconciling their disputes.	2013年，中国一直在进行反日宣传，与此同时，朴槿惠感到有必要采取行动修复与日本的关系，派遣个人特使与首相安倍晋三会晤，寻求谈判调和两国争端。
Given its insecurity, a by-product of the Korean Peninsula’s long division, South Korea requires, above all, calm and steady partners.	朝鲜半岛的长期分裂让韩国得不到安全，因此对韩国来说，最重要的莫过于时刻准备着的冷静伙伴。
But frequent changes in US policy toward Northeast Asia in recent years have disoriented South Korean policymakers, while Chinese policy, though consistent, confronts South Korea’s leaders with choices that they appear unprepared to make.	但近几年来，美国东北亚政策变化频繁，这令韩国决策者无所适从；而中国政策尽管具有一致性，却让韩国领导人不得不面对尚未做好准备的选择。
As a result, South Korea’s elite appears to be splitting into pro-Chinese and pro-American factions that transcend party lines.	结果，韩国精英在亲中和亲美之间分裂为两个跨越党派的阵营。
Over a period of time, the only beneficiaries are likely to be those who call for “Finlandization” of the Korean peninsula.	在相当长的一段时间里，唯一的受益者或许只有呼吁朝鲜半岛“芬兰化”的人。
Meanwhile, the impact on German foreign policy of the country’s deepening economic ties with Russia has been evident throughout the Ukraine crisis.	与此同时，德国外交政策令该国经济与俄罗斯结成深刻关系的影响在乌克兰危机中尽显无疑。
Though Merkel frequently admonished the Kremlin about its intervention in Ukraine, German public opinion – particularly that of the country’s business leaders – tied her hands.	尽管默克尔频繁劝诫克里姆林宫不要干预乌克兰，但德国公众观点 — — 特别是其商业领袖 — — 令默克尔大受掣肘。
Indeed, German big businesses have been the main obstacle to imposing the type of systemic sanctions that might have dissuaded Russian President Vladimir Putin from annexing Crimea and continuing to back the insurgency (which Russia itself incited) in eastern Ukraine.	事实上，德国大企业正是对俄罗斯实施系统性制裁的主要阻挠力量。 系统性制裁本或许可以让俄罗斯总统普京三思其吞并克里米亚并继续支持俄罗斯自身也牵涉其中的东乌克兰叛乱。
This is not the only recent case in which Germany has distanced itself from its allies and partners.	这并非最近得多与其盟友和伙伴拉开距离的唯一例子。
In Libya in 2011, Germany refused to offer even rudimentary material support to the military intervention staged by its British and French allies.	在2011年的利比亚事件中，德国甚至拒绝为其英国和法国盟友所实施的军事干预提供基本物质支持。
Germany has also continuously failed to meet its commitment to spend 2% of its GDP on defense, at the same time that it has insisted that troubled EU economies stick to austerity budgets that limit their deficits to a fixed proportion of their economic output.	德国也一直没有满足其将GDP的2%用于防务的承诺，与此同时，德国坚持要求受困欧盟经济体采取将斥资限制在经济产出一定比例之内的紧缩性预算。
Indeed, throughout the eurozone crisis, Germany did the absolute minimum – and always at the last possible moment – to assist its EU partners.	事实上，在整个欧元区危机中，德国在援助欧盟伙伴国方面付出的是绝对最小值 — — 并且总是在最后关头才付出。
And German leaders’ obsession with maintaining their country’s “golden decade” of exports appears to have gagged them on topics like China’s human rights abuses and its aggressive behavior toward its Asian neighbors.	德国李刚电脑人沉溺于保持德国出口的“黄金十年 ” ， 这令他们在中国侵犯人权以及冒犯亚洲邻国等问题上无从开口。
That silence is being rewarded with the first-ever joint cabinet sessions between a democracy and a communist dictatorship, which will take place in Berlin this autumn.	他们的缄默带来的好处是历史上首个民主国家与共产主义独裁政府间的联合内阁会议 — — 将于今年秋天在柏林举行。
In both Germany and South Korea, economic strength seems to have produced an illusion of policy independence that is opening a chasm between the two countries and their allies – a chasm that revelations of US spying, on Merkel in particular, have deepened.	在德国和韩国，经济优势似乎营造出一个政策独立的幻觉，而这一幻觉正在两国与其盟友之间形成裂痕 — — 并因为美国的间谍行为（特别是针对默克尔的行为）而深化。
Germany and South Korea, however, will gain little, and risk much, if they downgrade their alliance ties in favor of commercially motivated, if unofficial, neutrality.	但是，德国和韩国如果因为采取出于商业动机的中立（尽管不是正式中立）而弱化它们与盟友的关系的话，其风险将远大于利益。
Whatever short-term benefits they receive will be more than offset by their strategic vulnerabilities vis-à-vis Russia and China.	不论它们收获什么短期利益，都无法弥补它们在俄罗斯和中国面前的战略弱势。
	
Ending East Asia’s History Wars	结束东亚的历史战争
TOKYO – Georges Clemenceau, who, as France’s prime minister, led his country to victory in World War I, famously said that “war is too important to be left to the generals.”	东京—担任总理带领法国打赢第一次世界大战的克莱蒙梭有一句名言 ： “ 兵者事大，不可付诸将 。 ”
Japan is now discovering that history is too important to be left to newspaper editors.	日本现在发现，史者事大，不可付诸新闻编辑。
In the 1990s, the newspaper Asahi Shimbun caused a firestorm at home and in South Korea by publishing a series of articles, based upon testimony by the former Japanese soldier Seiji Yoshida, on “comfort women” – Koreans forced to provide sexual services to the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II.	20世纪90年代 ， 《 朝日新闻》发表了一系列基于前日军士兵吉田清治（Seiji Yoshida）回忆的关于“慰安妇”的文章。 二战期间，许多韩国妇女被迫为大日本帝国皇军提供性服务，被称为慰安妇。
Asahi has now admitted that the soldier’s confessions were unfounded, and has disavowed the core supporting evidence for the articles.	《朝日新闻》现在承认，吉田清治的自白根本是子虚乌有，该系列文章的核心支持证据也是假的。
That retraction appears to be causing as much embarrassment – and diplomatic vitriol – in Japan and South Korea today as the original series did.	如此翻供引起了轩然大波，其在今天的日本和韩国的影响不亚于文章发表之时。
But, at a time when both countries cannot afford to permit partisan or sloppy abuses of history to roil their bilateral relations, Asahi’s careless work has turned out to be more than abysmal journalism; it has introduced a dangerous element into regional diplomacy.	但是，如今两国都不能允许狭隘或草率的历史指责破坏双边关系 ， 《 朝日新闻》的鲁莽举动不仅是新闻业的污点；还给地区外交带来了危险元素。
Some say that Japan and South Korea should follow the example set by France and Germany.	有人说，日本和韩国应该效仿法国和德国的例子。
Reconciling in the first two decades following the Nazi Occupation of France, these countries’ leaders understood that their security and economic ties were far too important to their citizens’ wellbeing to allow the old hatreds to fester.	在纳粹占领法国后的第一个二十年里，两国领导人互相妥协，他们明白，对于公民福祉来说，安全和经济合作远比放任旧恨发酵更重要。
They knew that the unimaginable violence of WWII was a direct result of the antagonisms that had festered since the Napoleonic Wars and that were allowed to persist after 1918.	他们知道，二战的难以想象的暴力乃是对抗的直接后果，而对抗的源头是拿破仑战争，并且在1918年后放任其不断壮大。
In Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer, France and Germany had two of the twentieth century’s greatest statesmen, leaders who were able to discern the broad sweep of history through the fog of quotidian politics.	法国和德国拥有可跻身二十世纪最伟大政治家行列的戴高乐和阿登纳，他们能够拨开琐碎政治的迷雾，认清历史大势。
Their loyalty was not only to the citizens who elected them, but also to the generations of the past that had endured the consequences of Franco-German enmity, and to generations yet to come, which would benefit from reconciliation.	他们不仅忠诚于选他们做领导人的公民，也忠诚于经受了法德仇恨后果的先人和将从妥协中获益的尚未来到世上的后代。
Of course, given that Japan and Korea have not fought a series of wars against each other, their relationship is not the same as that between Germany and France.	当然，日本和韩国（朝鲜）之间交战频仍，其关系不同于德法关系。
But it is clear that no one will benefit from a new round of heated historical debate.	但显然，掀起新一轮激烈的历史争论不能让任何人受益。
To avoid this, political leaders like de Gaulle and Adenauer are needed.	为了避免这一点，日本和韩国需要戴高乐和阿登纳这样的政治领袖。
Only when we can discuss the past without endangering the future will the countries of Northeast Asia be able to establish a truly durable structure of peace.	我们什么时候能够平和地讨论过去、不给未来造成威胁，东北亚各国才能构建真正的持久和平框架。
As Admiral Dennis C. Blair, a former commander of the US Pacific Fleet, stated at a recent conference, “The history of Asia from the 1930s to about 1955 or so was not pretty in any way….I don’t think any country can have a monopoly on righteousness, or on guilt and shame” for that time.	前美国太平洋舰队司令布莱尔上将（Dennis C. Blair）在最近的会议上指出 ， “ 20世纪30年代到1955年左右的亚洲历史绝对算不上光彩 ， … …我认为没有一个国家占据着全部的正确性，也没有一个国家需要承担所有罪恶和羞耻 。 ”
Blair added that “the attempt to hold a ‘we were right’ and ‘you were wrong’ sweepstakes is not going to help our children and grandchildren understand what happened there.”	布莱尔还说 ， “ 一定要争出个对错对于让我们的子孙理解当时发生过什么毫无帮助 。 ”
Japan and South Korea need to take responsibility for the future, not obsess about the past.	日本和韩国需要为未来负责，而不能被过去羁绊。
A recent Japanese government white paper called South Korea the country “that shares the closest relationship with Japan historically and in areas such as economy and culture.”	最新的日本政府白皮书称韩国“与日本有着最为紧密的历史关系和经济和文化等领域的联系 。 ”
No doubt, many, if not most, South Korean foreign-policy experts and strategists share that sentiment.	毫无疑问，许多（甚至绝大部分）韩国外交政策专家和战略家都同意这一论断。
But it will take committed leadership to transcend the history wars and tap the full potential of Japanese-Korean cooperation, something that both countries’ key ally, the United States, strongly desires, as it seeks to draw China into a lasting and peaceful Asian order.	但只有有决心的领导层才能超越历史战争，充分激发日韩合作潜力，两国的关键盟友美国强烈支持日韩合作，以便让中国也加入持续的和平亚洲秩序。
For too long, intemperate historical debates – often driven by biased newspaper accounts – have poisoned bilateral relations.	历史争论 — — 往往受有偏见的报纸文章煽动 — — 毒害双边关系已有很长的时间。
Now, as another war of words heats up, Japanese and South Korean leaders need to step back, recognize where the real interests of their people lie, both today and in the future, and calmly begin to take the measures required to ensure durable reconciliation.	如今，又一场口水仗眼看着就要打响，日本和韩国灵动人应该后退一步，认清今天和未来人民的真正利益在哪里，冷静地开始采取必要措施确保持久妥协。
	
Taming the China Bears	驳中国崩溃论
BEIJING – The market is always in search of a story, and investors, it seems, think they have found a new one this year in China.	北京—市场总是在寻找故事，而投资者似乎认为今年在中国找到了一个新故事。
The country’s growth slowdown and mounting financial risks have spurred a growing wave of pessimism, with economists worldwide warning of an impending crash.	中国增长减速和金融风险积累让越来越多的人感到悲观，全球经济学家警告可能马上发生崩溃。
But dire predictions for China have abounded for the last 30 years, and not one has materialized.	但对中国的悲观预测在过去30年来早已见怪不怪，没有一个成为现实。
Are today’s really so different?	今天的预测真的会不同吗？
The short answer is no.	简单的答案是否定的。
Like the predictions of the past, today’s warnings are based on historical precedents and universal indicators against which China, with its unique economic features, simply cannot be judged accurately.	和过去的预测一样，今天的警告基于不利于中国的历史先例和普通指标，而中国的经济特征是独一无二的，因此这样的预测不可能准确。
The bottom line is that the complexity and distinctiveness of China’s economy mean that assessing its current state and performance requires a detail-oriented analysis that accounts for as many offsetting factors as possible.	说到底，中国经济的复杂性和特殊性意味着评估当前状况和表现需要以细节为导向的分析，尽可能多地考虑抵消性因素。
Predictions are largely pointless, given that the assumptions underpinning them will invariably change.	预测大部分毫无意义，因为基本假设总是在变化。
Consider China’s high leverage ratio, which many argue will be a key factor in causing a crisis.	以中国的高杠杆率为例，许多人认为，这将成为引发危机的重大因素。
After all, they contend, developing countries that have experienced a large-scale credit boom have all ended up facing a credit crisis and a hard economic landing.	他们指出，毕竟曾经经历过大规模信用繁荣的发展中国家最终都出现了信用危机和经济硬着陆。
But several specific factors must be accounted for in assessing whether this is China’s fate.	但在评估中国是否会蹈此覆辙时，必须考虑一些具体因素。
While China’s debt/GDP ratio is very high, the same is true in many successful East Asian economies, such as Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, and Malaysia.	中国债务/GDP之比固然很高，但其他许多成功的东亚经济体也是如此，比如中国台湾、新加坡、韩国、泰国和马来西亚。
And China’s saving rate is much higher.	并且中国的储蓄率要高得多。
Ceteris paribus, the higher the saving rate, the less likely it is that a high debt/GDP ratio will trigger a financial crisis.	给定其他条件不变，储蓄率越高，高债务/GDP比触发金融危机的可能性越小。
In fact, China’s high debt/GDP ratio is, to a large extent, a result of its simultaneously high saving and investment rates.	事实上，中国的高债务/GDP比在很大程度上是储蓄率和投资率同时高企的结果。
And, while the inability to repay loans can contribute to a high debt burden, the nonperforming-loan (NPL) ratio for China’s major banks stands at less than 1%.	此外，尽管无法偿还贷款让债务负担加重，但中国主要银行的不良贷款率仍低于1 % 。
If, based on these considerations, one concludes that China’s debt/GDP ratio does constitute a substantial threat to its financial stability, there remains the question of whether a crisis is likely to occur.	基于这些考虑，如果你认为中国的债务/GDP比确实构成了金融稳定的巨大威胁，那么还有一个问题：危机是否可能发生。
Only when all of the specific linkages between a high debt burden and the onset of a financial crisis have been identified can one draw even a tentative conclusion about that.	只有所有高债务负担和金融危机爆发之间的具体联系都存在，你才可以做出假设性的论断。
China’s real-estate price bubble is often named as a likely catalyst for a crisis.	中国的房地产泡沫经常被认为是危机的一大可能催化因素。
But how such a downturn would unfold is far from certain.	但危机会如何展开谁也说不清。
Let us assume that the real-estate bubble has burst.	不妨假设房地产泡沫已经破裂。
In China, there are no subprime mortgages, and the down payment on the purchase price required to qualify for financing can exceed 50%.	中国不存在次贷，要获得按揭，首付比例可能超过50 % 。
Given that property prices are unlikely to fall by such a large margin, the bubble’s collapse would not bring down China’s banks.	给定房地产价格难以出现如此大幅的下跌，则泡沫的破裂拖不垮中资银行。
Even if real-estate prices fell by more than 50%, commercial banks could survive – not least because mortgages account for only about 20% of banks’ total assets.	即使房地产价格下跌超过50 % ， 商业银行也可以存活下来 — — 次贷仅占银行总资产的20%左右。
At the same time, plummeting prices would attract new homebuyers in major cities, causing the market to stabilize.	与此同时，价格剧降会吸引大城市的新买家，让市场企稳。
And China’s recently announced urbanization strategy should ensure that cities’ demographic structure supports intrinsic demand.	中国最近宣布的城市化战略应能确保城市人口结构支持内在需求。
If that were not enough to ward off disaster, the government could purchase unsold properties and use them for social housing.	如果这还不足以防止灾难，那么政府还可以收购未出售住房用于社会保障房。
Moreover, if necessary, banks could recover funds by selling collateral.	此外，如有必要，银行可以拍卖抵押品回收资金。
As a last resort, the government could step in, as it did in the late 1990’s and early 2000’s, to remove NPLs from banks’ balance sheets.	最后，政府也可以介入，如20世纪90年代末、21世纪初那样将不良贷款从银行帐上剥离。
Indeed, China has a massive war chest of foreign-exchange reserves that it would not hesitate to use to inject capital into commercial banks.	事实上，中国有巨大的外汇储备，向商业银行注入资本根本不需要犹豫。
That remains a highly unlikely scenario.	这样的情景可能性很低。
China’s banking system does face risks stemming from a maturity mismatch between loans and deposits.	中国银行系统确实面临存贷款期限不匹配问题所产生的风险。
But the mismatch is less severe than some observers believe.	但这一不匹配的程度比一些观察者认为的轻。
In fact, the average term of deposits in China’s banks is about nine months, while medium- and long-term loans account for just over half of total outstanding credit.	事实上，中资银行平均存款期限是九个月左右，中长期贷款只是刚刚超出总未偿还信用的一半。
A more salient threat would arise if the government pursued too much capital-account liberalization too fast.	如果政府的资本账户自由化步子迈得太大太快，就会产生更大的风险。
If China eases restrictions on cross-border capital flows, an unexpected shock could trigger large-scale capital flight, bringing down the entire financial system.	如果中国放松跨境资本流限制，那么意外冲击就可能引发大规模资本外逃，拖垮整个金融体系。
Given this, it is vital that China maintains controls over short-term cross-border capital flows in the foreseeable future.	因此，中国，在可预见的未来，中国应该保持对短期跨净资本流的管制。
Likewise, the Chinese government must address a fundamental contradiction.	类似地，中国政府必须纠正一个基本矛盾。
Monetary interest rates have increased steadily, owing to rampant regulatory arbitrage (whereby banks find loopholes that enable them to avoid unfavorable rules) and the fragmentation of the credit market, while return on capital has fallen rapidly because of overcapacity.	由于监管套利肆虐（银行借此寻找漏洞规避不利规则）和信用市场分裂，货币利率稳步上升，与此同时，产能过剩却让资本回报快速下降。
If the Chinese government fails to reverse this trend, a financial crisis – in one form or another – will become inevitable.	如果中国政府不能扭转这一趋势，金融危机 — — 不管以何种形式 — — 就将难以避免。
But, given the authorities’ broad scope for policy intervention, the crash will not come anytime soon – if it comes at all.	但是，考虑到当局有很大的政策干预余地，即使不能完全排除崩溃的可能，短期也不太可能发生崩溃。
	
The Long March from the Third Plenum	三中全会，长征的起点
BEIJING – Though China’s leadership succession was completed earlier this year, the policy agenda for the coming decade has only just been revealed.	北京—尽管中国领导层交接已在今年早些时候完成，但未来十年的政策日程才刚刚揭开。
Following Chinese political tradition, the country’s new leadership had to wait for the Third Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party’s 18th Central Committee – held 3-4 quarters after the First Plenum, where the succession was sealed – to unveil its economic-policy priorities.	根据中国政治传统，新领导层必须等到中共十八届三中全会 — — 大约要在交接尘埃落定后3—4个季度召开 — — 才能公布其经济政策顺序。
Third Plenums – and perhaps only Third Plenums – can bring about radical transformation.	三中全会 — — 可能也只有三中全会 — — 能够带来彻底的改变。
Indeed, it was at the Third Plenum of the CCP’s 11th Central Committee that Deng Xiaoping launched the reforms that opened up the Chinese economy and triggered more than three decades of rapid economic growth.	事实上，邓小平正是在中共十一届三中全会上拉开了改革开放的序幕，开启了三十年的快速经济增长时期。
The Third Plenums of the CCP’s 14th and 16th Central Committees – held in 1993 and 2003, respectively – also stand out.	中共十四届和十六届三中全会（分别于1993年和2003年召开）也相当突出。
At both meetings, CCP leaders put forward comprehensive plans for the creation and perfection of the so-called “socialist market economy” in China.	在这两次会议上，中共领导人推出了建立和完善“社会主义市场经济”的全面计划。
The 60-point “resolution” produced at the most recent Third Plenum covers six areas: the economy, the political system, the environment, culture, society, and Party capacity-building.	最近的十八届三中全会所公布的60点《决定》覆盖了六大领域：经济、政治制度、环境、文化、社会和党的能力建设。
This represents a significant departure from the agendas produced at previous Third Plenums, which focused exclusively on economic reform.	这与焦点全部集中在经济改革的前几次三中全会大不相同。
But, when it comes to economic-reform objectives, the resolution is not overwhelmingly innovative.	但是，对于经济改革目标，十八届三中全会的《决定》算不上十足的创新。
Indeed, most of the goals that it includes – like reform of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), development of private enterprise, reduction of government intervention, protection of property rights, and creation of a modern market system – can be found in the resolution of the Third Plenum of the CCP’s 16th Central Committee.	事实上 ， 《 决定》所包括的大部分目标 — — 如国有企业改革、民营企业发展、减少政府干预、保护产权和建立现代市场制度 — — 都可以在中共十六届三中全会《决定》中找到。
Even the decision to redefine the market’s role in resource allocation as “decisive” was not the breakthrough that many observers have claimed.	即使是重新定义市场在资源配置中起“决定性”作用的决定，也不像许多观察者所说的那样算得上突破。
After all, the 2003 resolution had already defined the market as “fundamental” to resource allocation.	毕竟，2003年的《决定》便已定义市场在资源配置中起“基础性”作用。
Given this, the latest resolution’s most important implication is that it has dispelled any doubt about the new leadership’s commitment to the market-oriented reform that Deng initiated in 1978.	基于此，最新的《决定》的最大影响在于打消了任何关于新领导层是否会遵循邓小平在1978年开始实施的市场改革的疑虑。
In line with tradition, the Third Plenum’s resolution did not discuss problems concerning growth and development, which one hopes the government will address in greater detail in the near future.	根据传统，此次三中全会《决定》没有讨论关于增长和发展的问题，而人们希望政府尽快给出这方面问题的详细方案。
That said, some of the resolution’s specific provisions for economic reform represent much-needed progress.	尽管如此 ， 《 决定》的一些具体经济改革措施直指急需的方向。
· SOEs will be required to deliver 30% of their profits to the state, instead of keeping most – or even all – of their profits, as they have done for the last two decades.	· 国有企业将被要求把30%的利润上缴国家，而不是像在过去二十年中那样留存大部分甚至所有利润。
· Farmers will be granted more property rights, allowing them, for example, to transfer and mortgage land-use rights, though the government understandably continues to exercise caution about rural-land privatization.	· 农民将获得更多的产权，允许转移和抵押土地使用权，尽管不难理解，政府对于农地私有化仍十分谨慎。
· A real-estate property tax will be introduced, in order to suppress skyrocketing housing prices and reduce the vacancy rate – a controversial but perhaps necessary move.	· 将实施房地产税，以抑制高企的房价和降低空置率 — — 这一措施会引起争议，但可能必须实施。
· The one-child policy will be eased, allowing a couple to have two children if one parent is an only child.	· 独生子女政策将放松，允许一方为独生子女的夫妻生育二孩。
(Whether this change will be enough to reverse problematic demographic trends remains a topic of heated debate.)	（这一改变是否足以扭转不利的人口趋势仍是个争论激烈的话题。 ）
· The government will “accelerate the reform of the household registration system,” in an effort to facilitate urbanization.	· 政府将“加快户籍制度改革 ” ， 以促进城镇化。
But emphasis seems to have shifted to encourage coordinated development between urban and rural areas.	但重点似乎转移到了鼓励城镇和农村地区的协调发展上。
While rural migrant workers will be encouraged to settle in small and medium-size cities, migration to metropolises will remain tightly controlled – or even be more strictly regulated.	尽管农民工将被鼓励在中小城市定居，但向大城市的转移仍将被高度控制 — — 甚至管理更加严格了。
But the resolution’s genuinely groundbreaking objectives lie in other areas.	但《决定》真正的突破性目标在其他领域。
For starters, the resolution includes two potentially game-changing legal reforms.	首先 ， 《 决定》包含了两项具有改变局面效果的法律改革。
First, it emphasizes the government’s commitment to “respect and protect human rights,” prohibiting law-enforcement authorities from extracting confessions “by torture, corporal punishment, or abuse” and abolishing widely criticized programs for “re-education through the labor system.”	一是《决定》强调政府要“尊重和保护人权 ” ， 禁止执法当局“刑讯逼供，体罚虐待 ” ， 并废除了饱受批评的“劳动教养”制度。
Second, in order to strengthen judicial independence, the resolution includes a call “to explore the establishment of judicial jurisdiction systems that are suitably separated from administrative areas.”	第二，为了加强司法独立性 ， 《 决定》要求“探索建立与行政区划适当分��的司法管辖制度 ” 。
In other words, the courts should be able to make decisions independently of the local governments that finance them.	换句话说，法院应该能够独立于向它们提供资金的地方政府做出决定。
In the political realm, the resolution includes measures to strengthen China’s so-called “consultative democracy.”	在政治领域 ， 《 决定》中包括了强化中国所谓的“协商民主”的措施。
While the concept of enhancing the role of non-CCP forces in Chinese politics is not new, its prominence in the resolution reflects the Party’s willingness to adopt a more democratic political system – as long as it retains its dominant position, of course.	尽管加强非共产党人士在中国政治中的作用并非新的概念，但期在《决定》中的显赫地位反映出中共准备采取更加民主的政治制度 — — 当然，只要它能继续保持主宰地位。
In a one-party system, meritocracy is a prerequisite for good governance, which in turn plays a central role in maintaining social stability.	在一党制度下，精英治国是好治理的前提，而好治理又是维持社会稳定的关键。
Unfortunately, meritocracy has been eroded by a political culture of sycophancy and cynicism.	不幸的是，精英治国受到了谄媚和犬儒政治文化的侵蚀。
Designing a screening mechanism to minimize adverse selection in choosing bureaucrats and party officials has become one of the biggest challenges that China’s ruling elites confront.	设计监督机制以实现党政官员选拔中的逆向选择的最小化已成为中国执政精英所面临的最大挑战之一。
Although the resolution’s general message is encouraging, a shopping list of reform objectives is not a strategic analysis of the contradictions that are undermining China’s development, let alone an action plan for responding to these contradictions.	尽管《决定》的基本信息令人振奋，但改革目标清单算不上对破坏中国发展的矛盾的战略分析，更不用说应对这些矛盾的行动计划了。
Indeed, for China’s new leadership, the successful completion of the Third Plenum is only the first step in a new long march toward a more stable, prosperous future.	事实上，对中国的新领导层来说，成功完成三中全会只是通往更稳定繁荣的未来的长征的第一步。
	
China’s Trilemma	中国的三角困境
BEIJING – The Nobel laureate economist Robert Mundell showed that an economy can maintain two – but only two – of three key features: monetary-policy independence, a fixed exchange rate, and free cross-border capital flows.	发自北京 — — 诺贝尔经济学奖得主罗伯特·蒙代尔指出一个经济体能且只能维持三个关键特性（货币政策独立性，固定汇率和跨境自由流动）中的两个。
But China is currently juggling all three – an act that is becoming increasingly difficult to sustain.	而中国当前正奋力同时实现这三者 — — 但这种做法越来越难以掌控。
At first glance, this may not seem to be the case.	粗看之下，这种说法似乎不太正确。
Given that the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has largely maintained its monetary-policy independence over the last three decades, and actively manages the renminbi’s exchange rate, it is natural to conclude that China imposes strict controls on capital flows.	考虑到中国人民银行在过去三十年间绝大多数时间都能维持其货币政策独立性，并对人民币的汇率实施积极管理，人们也会自然而然地推断中国队资本流动给予了严格管制。
In fact, China liberalized inward foreign direct investment more than 20 years ago, and eased controls for much of the capital account thereafter.	但事实上，中国早在20多年前已经放开了面向本国的外国直接投资，自那以后也已对大部分资本账户松了绑。
China’s efforts to regulate cross-border capital flows have never been very effective.	中国试图控制跨境资本流动的努力从来都收效甚微。
During the Asian financial crisis of the 1990s, China had to implement draconian measures to prevent capital flight.	在1990年代的亚洲金融危机期间，中国只得采取极为严苛的手段防止资本外流。
In the early 2000s, short-term capital began to flow into China, with investors betting on the renminbi’s appreciation and, from 2004-2006, on rising asset prices.	在本世纪初那几年，投资者们赌人民币升值，在2004~2006年间又押注资产价格升值，导致短期资本开始流入中国。
Since renminbi internationalization was launched in 2009, exchange-rate arbitrage and the carry trade have surged.	自从人民币国际化在2009年启动之后，汇率投机和套利交易也因此大幅增加。
Certainly, China’s capital controls, though porous, increase the transaction costs of moving short-term capital to and from China, thereby reducing upward pressure on the renminbi’s exchange rate; in extreme circumstances, this could play a decisive role in China’s financial security.	当然，虽然中国的资本管制漏洞百出，但也增加了短期资本进出中国的交易成本，因此也减少了人民币汇率的上行压力；在极端情况下，这甚至可以在中国的金融安全方面扮演重要角色。
But capital continues to flow – if not entirely freely – across China’s borders.	但资本依然继续在不断穿越（若非完全自由的话）中国国境。
This raises an obvious question: How has China managed to defy the Mundell trilemma by maintaining all three policy objectives simultaneously?	因此就产生了一个显而易见的问题：中国是如何通过同时维持三大政策目标来逆转蒙代尔三重困境的？
The answer lies in China’s sterilization policy.	而答案就在中国的货币冲销政策之中。
China has run a capital-account surplus for most of the last 30 years, and a trade surplus every year since 1993.	中国在过去30年间绝大多数时候都拥有资本帐户顺差，并自1993年以来一直保持着贸易顺差。
The PBOC keeps the exchange rate stable by intervening heavily in the foreign-exchange market, creating so much liquidity that the authorities must engage in massive sterilization to avoid overshooting the targeted increase in the monetary base.	中国人民银行大力干预外汇市场以维持汇率稳定，并以此创造了巨额流动性，迫使当局采取大规模冲销措施以避免增量超出货币基础的设定目标。
In China, unlike in advanced countries, monetary and sterilization policy are often one in the same.	跟发达国家不同的是，中国的货币与冲销政策经常都是同一套做法。
The degree to which monetary policy is expansionary depends on the degree to which the liquidity created by currency-market intervention has been sterilized.	货币政策扩张的程度取决于有多少货币市场干预下产生的流动性是被冲销掉了。
The most frequently used monetary instrument in sterilization is open-market operations.	而冲销中使用最频繁的货币工具则是公开市场操作。
Given China’s twin surpluses, the PBOC sold all of the government bonds that it had accumulated in 2003, so it has been selling central-bank bills ever since, with CN¥5 trillion ($812 billion) in such bills currently held by banks.	考虑到中国的双顺差状况，人民银行在2003年全部出售了之前积累下来的政府债券，随后则开始出售中央银行票据，估计有价值5万亿元人民币（折合8120亿美元）的这类票据被银行所持有。
Another important instrument for sterilization is the reserve-requirement ratio, which, when raised, locks a large amount of liquidity in the banking system.	另一个重要的冲销工具则是存款准备金率，提升该比率就能锁定银行系统中的一大笔流动性。
The ratio, which the PBOC has changed 42 times since 1998, currently stands at 20% – double the ratio for large banks in the United States.	在人民银行自1998年以来修改了42次之后，该比率目前维持在20 % — —比美国大型银行高一倍。
Whatever the mechanism, the costs of sterilization are very high.	不管使用何种机制，冲销的成本都极为高昂。
For starters, by maintaining an undervalued real exchange rate, China has fallen into the so-called “dollar trap,” boosting the US dollar’s international importance at China’s own expense.	首先，为了维持一个低估的实际利率，中国陷入了一个所谓的“美元陷阱 ” ， 以牺牲自身为代价提升了美元的国际地位。
As time passes, the senselessness of this policy will become increasingly apparent.	随着时间推移，这一政策的不合理性也日益凸显。
Sterilization also leads to a serious misallocation of resources, most obviously by functioning as a subsidy to the export sector, at the expense of the rest of the economy.	冲销政策也导致了资源的严重错配，最明显的就是其异化成为对出口部门的补贴，却让其他经济部门因此受害。
A less noticed form of resource misallocation stems from the fact that only sellers of foreign exchange gain liquidity, but the whole economy feels the effects.	资源错配的另一个不明显形式则源自于只有外汇的卖出者们得到了流动性，但整体经济都感受到了影响。
As a result, small and medium-size enterprises that produce non-tradable products are denied much-needed funds and suffer from sterilization’s negative externalities.	结果生产非贸易类产品的中小型企业无法得到急需的资金并受到了冲销政策负面外部性的冲击。
Furthermore, the high reserve ratio and forced purchase of central-bank bills squeezes commercial banks’ profits severely – a phenomenon that will be intensified by interest-rate liberalization.	此外，高存款贮备金率和强制购买央行票据严重积压了商业银行的利润空间 — — 该情况在利率管制放松之后还将进一步恶化。
The quest for yield on available funds will drive banks to make riskier investments.	为了在已有的资金水平下追求更高利润，各大银行职能涉足更高风险的投资。
There are also quasi-fiscal costs involved.	这还另外牵涉到准财政成本。
Fortunately, despite the low returns on foreign assets, this is not yet a major problem for China, owing to the low costs of the corresponding PBOC liabilities.	幸运的是，尽管国外资产的回报较低，但由于对应的中国人民银行借贷成本也不高，所以对中国来说还不算是个重大问题。
Nonetheless, though predictions that China would abandon its exchange-rate controls in order to uphold monetary autonomy have proved wrong over the last decade, this time may be different.	即便如此，虽然中国将放弃其汇率管制以提升货币自主性的预测在过去十年内都被证伪，但这此情况可能有所不同。
With China’s liberalization of interest rates and short-term capital flows making it increasingly difficult for the country to juggle Mundell’s “irreconcilable trinity,” one hopes that Chinese leaders will finally allow the renminbi to float, while keeping in place existing capital controls.	随着中国放宽利率和短期资本流动，该国也日渐难以反抗蒙代尔的“无可调和三角定律 ” ， 希望中国领导人最终能在维持现有资本管制的情况下，允许人民币自由浮动。
	
Reviving China’s Rebalancing	重振中国再平衡
BEIJING – China is at a crossroads.	北京—中国正站在十字路口.
After experiencing three decades of unprecedentedly rapid GDP growth, the country weathered the global economic crisis exceptionally well.	在经历了三十年的前所未有的快速GDP增长后，中国又无与伦比地抵御了全球经济危机。
But it sustains considerable economic imbalances, which are undermining its ability to achieve high-income status.	但它也维持了严重的经济失衡，并且威胁到了它实现步入高收入行列的能力。
The question is whether China’s leaders – preoccupied with challenges like financial instability stemming from risky shadow-banking activities and a heavy burden of local-government debt – have the policy space to put the economy on a sounder footing.	问题在于，面临来自高风险影子银行活动和沉重的地方政府债务负担的金融动荡的挑战，中国领导人是否有政策空间让经济走上更可靠的轨道。
In the aftermath of the global economic crisis, China appeared to be on track to complete such a rebalancing.	全球经济危机爆发后，中国似乎走上了完成这一再平衡的轨道。
Its current-account surplus fell from more than 10% of GDP in 2007 to 2.6% in 2012, and it ran a large capital-account deficit for the first time since 1998.	其经常项目盈余从2007年占GDP的10%下降到2012年的2.6 % ， 并且自1998年以来第一次出现了大规模资本账户赤字。
Moreover, China added only $98.7 billion to its foreign-exchange reserves in 2012, compared to an average annual increase of more than $435 billion from 2007 to 2011.	此外，2012年中国外汇储备只增加了987亿美元，而在2007—2011年间平均每年都要增长4350亿美元以上。
That meant diminishing upward pressure on the renminbi’s exchange rate.	这意味着人民币汇率升值压力将减小。
But, over the last year, China’s imbalances returned with a vengeance.	但是，去年中国的失衡又卷土重来。
Its 2013 trade surplus likely exceeded $250 billion; its capital-account surplus exceeded $200 billion in the first three quarters of the year; and its foreign-exchange reserves soared by $509.7 billion.	2013年贸易盈余可能突破2500亿美元；其资本账户盈余在前三季度突破了2000亿美元；其外汇储备激增5097亿美元。
Meanwhile, the lower current-account surplus (as a share of GDP) could be a result of its increased investment-income deficit.	与此同时，经常项目盈余的下降（以占GDP比重衡量）可能是因为投资-收入赤字增加的结果。
And, while recovery in the advanced economies boosted exports, persistent overcapacity, combined with slower household-consumption growth than in 2012, caused investment growth, though still rapid, to decline to its lowest rate in the past 11 years.	此外，尽管发达经济体的复苏提振了出口，但持续的产能过剩加上家庭消费增长较2012年放缓导致投资增长降到了过去11年以来的最低水平（尽管依然算得上强劲 ） 。
In principle, a country can run a current-account deficit or surplus continuously for decades.	理论上，一国可以在几十年的时间里一直存在经常项目赤字或盈余。
But China’s chronic surpluses are problematic.	但中国的长期盈余是有问题的。
Given that China remains among the world’s poorest countries, with per capita income amounting to less than $7,000, its position as the world’s largest exporter of capital signifies a gross misallocation of resources.	由于中国仍是世界最穷的国家之一，人均收入只有不到7000美元，其作为世界最大资本出口国彰显出资源的严重错配。
In fact, after running twin current- and capital-account surpluses persistently for two decades, China’s foreign-exchange reserves are poised to break the $4 trillion threshold, with the marginal cost of every dollar accrued vastly surpassing its potential benefits.	事实上，在经历了二十年的经常项目和资本项目双盈余后，中国外汇储备将突破4万亿美元大关，其继续增加的每一美元所带来的边际成本都远远高于潜在收益。
In this context, the continued accumulation of foreign-exchange reserves is clearly counterproductive.	在这样的条件下，继续积累外汇储备毫无疑问不利于生产。
Of course, rebalancing China’s economy will take time, and it will entail some risks and sacrifices.	当然，中国经济的再平衡需要时间，并且会带来一些风险和牺牲。
But China’s leaders must recognize that the country faces massive welfare losses, and thus should be willing to accept slower growth in the short term in exchange for a more stable long-term growth path.	但中国领导人必须认识到，中国面连着大规模福利损失，因此需要拿出接受短期增长放缓以换取更稳定的长期增长路径的意愿。
In fact, with a well-designed policy package, the duration and impact of the growth slowdown could be minimized.	事实上，只要政策设计合理，增长放缓的时间和影响是可以最小化的。
A critical first step is for the People’s Bank of China to stop intervening in the foreign-exchange market, which would halt the growth of the country’s foreign-exchange reserves.	关键的第一步是中国人民银行要停止干预外汇市场，这将能阻止中国外汇储备的增加。
In other words, China should adopt a floating exchange-rate regime as soon as possible.	换句话说，中国应该尽快采取浮动汇率机制。
Although this transition would have a negative impact on China’s economic growth, it would not be nearly as dire as many seem to believe.	尽管这一转变会给中国经济增长带来消极影响，但并不会像许多人所担心的那样严重。
For starters, while it would likely cause the renminbi to strengthen, the consensus in China is that the current exchange rate is not far from the equilibrium level, meaning that the appreciation would likely be moderate.	首先，虽然它可能造成人民币升值，但中国的共识是当前汇率与均衡水平相差不远，因而升值将是温和的。
Likewise, although renminbi appreciation would diminish export growth, the slowdown would probably not be dramatic, given that China’s export sector is dominated by the processing trade (specifically, the assembly of intermediate inputs imported from countries like Japan and South Korea).	类似地，尽管人民币升值会抑制出口增长，但减速可能不会很严重，因为中国的出口部门主要是加工贸易（具体地说，就是组装进口自日本和韩国等国家的中间产品 ） 。
And the accompanying increase in imports is unlikely to damage China’s economic growth significantly; it is more likely to complement, rather than substitute for, domestic demand.	而随之增加的进口也不可能对中国经济增长造成很大伤害；而更有可能起到补充而不是替代内需的作用。
In short, China can afford the costs of rebalancing.	简言之，中国承担得起再平衡的成本。
Given that the liquidity flowing into China over the last several years was increasingly short-term capital aimed at exchange-rate and interest-rate arbitrage (so-called “hot money”), there may be a surge in capital outflows when appreciation expectations have disappeared.	过去几年中流入中国的流动性是日益短期的旨在进行汇率和利率套利的资本（即所谓的“热钱 ” ） ，因此当升值预期消失时可能会出现资本大量外流。
To prevent large-scale capital flight from threatening China’s financial stability, cross-border flows must be managed carefully.	为了防止大规模资本外逃威胁中国的金融稳定，跨境流必须谨慎地进行管理。
A flexible exchange rate dictated by market forces would eliminate the opportunities for currency speculators to make one-way bets on renminbi appreciation, thereby diminishing the stock of hot money that currently accounts for the bulk of China’s capital-account surplus.	由市场力量决定的弹性汇率将扼杀货币投机者对人民币升值下单边注的机会，从而减少热钱存量。 目前热钱占据了中国资本账户盈余的大头。
Even if China’s current account remained in surplus for some time, the shift from twin surpluses to a more normal external position would boost the efficiency of resource allocation considerably.	即使中国经常项目在一段时间内还将保持盈余，从双盈余转向更加正常的外部处境能大幅改善资源配置的效率。
For too long, China has delayed the necessary adjustment of its balance-of-payments structure.	中国收支结构的必要调整已经拖得太久。
It is time to make a change, even if it requires bracing for some risks.	是时候做出改变了，即使这需要冒一些风险。
	
China’s Investment Addiction	中国的投资依赖
BEIJING – China’s economy slowed unexpectedly in the second quarter of this year.	北京—今年二季度，中国经济出人意料地放缓了。
Just as unexpectedly, most data released since July suggest that China’s growth has stabilized.	同样出人意料的是，7月以来的大部分公布的大部分数据表明中国的增长已经稳定下来。
Markets, not surprisingly, have breathed a collective sigh of relief.	毫不奇怪，市场同时大舒一口气。
But should investors still be nervous?	但投资者应该继续保持紧张吗？
Currently, the most severe problem confronting Chinese authorities is overcapacity.	目前中国当局所面临的最严重的问题是产能过剩。
For example, China’s annual production capacity for crude steel is one billion tons, but its total output in 2012 was 720 million tons – a capacity utilization rate of 72%.	比如，中国粗钢年产能为十亿吨，但2012年总产量只有7.2亿吨 — — 产能利用率为72 % 。
More strikingly, the steel industry’s profitability was just 0.04% in 2012.	更引人注目的是2012年钢铁业利润率只有0.04 % 。
Indeed, the profit on two tons of steel was just about enough to buy a lollipop.	事实上，生产量吨钢所获得的利润只能买一根棒棒糖。
So far this year, the average profitability of China’s top 500 companies is 4.34%, down 33 basis points from 2012.	今年截至目前中国前500家公司平均利润率为4.34 % ， 比2012年下降33个基点。
Some say that today’s overcapacity is a result of China’s past overinvestment.	有人说今天的产能过剩来自过去的过度投资。
Others attribute it to a lack of effective demand.	也有人认为产能过剩是因为有效需求不足。
The government seems to come down in the middle.	政府的观点似乎是两者的折中。
On one hand, the authorities have ordered thousands of companies to reduce capacity.	一方面，当局要求数千家公司削减产能。
On the other hand, the government has introduced some “mini-stimulus” measures, ranging from exemptions for “micro firms” from business and sales taxes to pressure on banks to increase loans to exporters.	另一方面，政府引入了一些“迷你刺激”措施，比如“微型企业”免除营业税和销售税、要求银行增加出口企业贷款等。
The authorities’ official line is that China’s growth model requires less investment and more consumption.	当局的官方口径是中国的增长模式需要减少投资、增加消费。
But not all Chinese economists agree.	但并非所有中国经济学家都同意这一点。
They argue that capital stock is the key factor for growth, and that China’s per capita capital stock is still low relative to developed countries, which implies considerable scope for further investment.	他们认为资本存量是增长的关键因素，而中国的人均资本存量相对发达国家仍然很低，这意味着未来投资空间很大。
To be sure, capital accumulation is a driving force of economic growth, and catching up with developed-country income levels implies that China must increase its capital stock in the long run.	诚然，资本积累是经济增长的一大动力，而赶超发达国家收入水平要求中国必须在长期增加资本存量。
But what is at issue is not the size of the capital stock, or even the level of investment; the problem is the growth rate of investment, which has been significantly higher than that of GDP for decades.	但要紧的不是资本存量的规模，甚至也不是投资水平；要紧的是投资的增长率，几十年来这一数字大大高于GDP增长率。
According to official statistics, China’s investment rate is approaching 50% of GDP.	根据官方统计数字，中国的投资率已接近GDP的50 % 。
Given absorption constraints, capital efficiency has been falling steadily amid increasing deadweight.	拜吸收约束所赐，资本效率随着资本规模的增加而稳步下降。
If environmental damage caused by breakneck investment growth were taken into account, China’s capital efficiency would be even lower.	如果把飞速增长的投资所造成的环境破坏考虑在内，中国的资本效率还会更低。
Human capital and technological progress are as important to economic growth as physical capital and labor, if not more so.	人力资本和技术进步对经济增长的作用不亚于实体资本和劳动。
If resource allocation is skewed toward physical capital at the expense of accumulating human capital – for which adequate consumption is indispensable – economic growth would be more likely to slow than rise.	如果资源配置向实体资本的倾斜以破坏人力资本积累为代价 — — 而后者又是充分消费的不可或缺的条件 — — 经济增长就更有可能放缓而不是加快。
So China should reduce the growth rate of investment and increase that of consumption, allowing the investment rate to settle at a more sustainable level.	因此，中国应该降低投资增长率，提高消费增长率，让投资率在更加可持续的水平上稳定下来。
Of course, it is not entirely untrue that China’s overcapacity reflects a shortfall of effective demand.	当然，说中国的产能过剩反映的是有效需求的不足也不是完全错误的。
But where can effective demand come from?	但有效需求来自何处？
Again, China’s steel industry provides a telling example.	在这方面，中国钢铁业再次提供了很好的例子。
Despite China’s lack of a comparative advantage for steel production, it has built approximately one thousand mills, with output accounting for roughly half of the global total.	尽管中国在钢生产方面并无比较优势，但仍建设了大约一千家钢铁厂，产出占了全球总产量的半壁江山。
As early as 2004, China’s government tried to clamp down on overinvestment; and yet output increased dramatically, from 300 million tons that year to a billion tons in 2012, owing to strong demand generated by investment in infrastructure and real-estate development.	早在2004年，中国政府就试图降温过度投资；但由于基础设施投资和房地产开发所带来的强劲需求，产出仍然增长迅猛，从当年的3亿吨增加到2012年的10亿吨。
China’s investment consists of mainly three broad categories: manufacturing industry, infrastructure, and real estate.	中国的投资大体可分为三块：制造业、基础设施和房地产业。
In late 2008 and 2009, at the height of the global financial crisis, stimulus-fueled infrastructure investment sustained output growth.	2008年底和2009年全球金融危机顶峰时，经济刺激带来的基础设施投资提升维持了产出增长。
In 2010, investment in real-estate development replaced infrastructure investment as the main driver of growth.	2010年，房地产开发投资取代了基础设施投资成为增长的主要动力。
Today, both infrastructure and real estate are important drivers of China’s growth.	如今，基础设施和房地产都是中国增长的重要推动力。
China does need more infrastructure investment – particularly in power and water utilities, transport, and communications.	中国确实需要更多的基础设施投资 — — 特别是在电力和水电、交通和通信方面。
But the pace of investment must take financial constraints fully into consideration.	但投资节奏必须充分考虑金融约束。
More important, China can and should invest more in social infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, retirement homes, and so on.	更重要的是，中国可以也应该更多地投资学校、医院、养老院等社会基础设施。
However, real-estate investment is another story.	但房地产投资则是另一回事。
It is difficult to judge how serious China’s property bubble is and when it might burst.	很难判断中国地产泡沫的严重程度以及破灭时间。
But one thing is certain: China has invested too much in real-estate development.	但有一点是肯定的：中国在房地产开发上已经投资得太多了。
With per capita income at less than $6,000, homeownership in China is roughly 90%, compared to less than 70% in the United States.	中国的人均收入不到6000美元，但中国房屋自有率高达90%左右，而美国还不到70 % 。
Average floor space per capita is 32.9 square meters, while median floor space per family in Hong Kong is just 48 square meters.	人均住房面积为32.9平米，而香港中位家庭住房面积才刚刚达到48平米。
China has 696 five-star hotels, with another 500 on the way.	中国有696家五星级饭店，另有500家在建。
Five of the ten tallest skyscrapers under construction worldwide are in China.	在建的十座最高建筑中有五座位于中国。
In my view, this is madness.	在我看来这只能用疯狂来形容。
China’s economy is being held hostage by real-estate investment.	中国经济正在被房地产投资绑架。
On one hand, China should not try to eliminate overcapacity by maintaining the high growth rate of real-estate investment.	一方面，中国不应该通过保持房地产投资的高增长率来解决产能过剩。
While investment in social housing should be welcomed, real-estate investment, currently running at 10-13% of GDP, is already far too high.	社会住房项目投资值得欢迎，但目前占GDP高达10—13%的房地产投资已经显得太高。
On the other hand, if real-estate investment growth falls, overcapacity will be difficult to eliminate.	另一方面，如果房地产投资增长回落，产能过生就无法消除。
This dilemma highlights the structural-adjustment challenge that China faces – and should give investors reason to hold their breath.	这��两难凸显出中国所面临的结构性调整挑战 — — 也应该让投资者保持谨慎。
That said, there are two caveats.	总而言之，有两点值得警惕。
First, unlike other categories of investment, real estate investment does not increase productive capital stock.	首先，与其他投资类型不同，房地产投资并不增加生产性资本存量。
There is no fundamental difference between a house and an expensive durable consumer good.	房子和高价耐久消费品之间并无根本不同。
Second, in China’s statistics, the growth rate of gross fixed-asset investment is much higher than that of gross capital formation.	其次，在中国的统计数据中，总固定资产投资增长率显著高于总资本形成增长率。
This indicates that data on the growth rate of fixed-asset investment may have exaggerated the pace of capital-stock accumulation.	这表明固定投资的增长率数据可能夸大了资本存量积累的速度。
Hence, while the Chinese government should be firm on reducing the dependence of growth on investment, it must exercise utmost care when doing so.	因此，尽管中国政府应该坚决地减少经济增长对投资的依赖，但动作必须非常谨慎。
	
China’s Fire Next Time	中国的下一场火
BEIJING – Earlier this year, rumors of China’s impending financial doom – triggered by either a housing-market crash or local-government debt defaults – were rampant.	北京—今年早些时候，关于中国马上就要因为房地产市场崩溃或地方政府债务违约而爆发金融崩溃的传闻日嚣尘上。
But, in recent months, the economy has stabilized, leaving few doubts about China’s ability to grow by more than 7% this year.	但是，最近几个月来，中国经济趋向稳定，已无多少人怀疑中国有能力在今年保持GDP增长7%以上。
Given that the Chinese government had ample scope for policy intervention, this turnaround should come as no surprise.	中国政府有充足的政策干预空间，因此如此转折并不令人奇怪。
But the moment of financial reckoning has merely been postponed, not averted.	但金融清算的时刻只是被暂停了，而没有被消除。
The fundamental problems that triggered alarm bells in the first place – including real-estate bubbles, local-government debt, rapid growth in shadow-banking activity, and rising corporate leverage ratios – remain unresolved.	在一开始敲响警钟的根本问题 — — 包括房地产泡沫、地方政府债务、影子银行活动迅速扩张、公司杠杆率高企等 — — 仍没有解决。
Of these, the most immediate threat to China’s economic and financial stability is the combination of high borrowing costs, low profitability for nonfinancial corporations, and very high corporate leverage ratios.	在这些问题中，对中国经济和金融稳定最紧迫的威胁是高借贷成本、非金融企业利润低下以及企业杠杆率畸高的组合问题。
According to a study by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the debt/GDP ratio for China’s nonfinancial corporations was 113% by the end of 2012.	根据中国社科院的一项研究，截至2012年末，中国非金融企业债务/GDP之比为113 % 。
Standard & Poor’s found that, a year later, these firms’ total debt amounted to $14.2 trillion, eclipsing the $13.1 trillion of outstanding debt in the United States and making China the world’s largest issuer of corporate debt.	标准普尔公司（Standard & Poor’s）认为，一年后，这些企业的总债务将达到14.2万亿美元，超过美国未偿还债务规模（13.1万亿美元 ） ， 使中国成为世界上第一大企业债发行国。
There is no indication that the ratio will decline anytime soon, which is particularly worrisome, given the low profitability and high borrowing costs that China’s industrial enterprises face.	没有迹象表明这一比率会在短时间内下降，而这尤其令人担忧，因为中国工业企业面临着低盈利能力和高借贷成本。
Indeed, Chinese firms’ profitability amounted to just over 6% last year, with 2012 profits for China’s 500 largest (mostly state-owned) corporations barely exceeding 2%.	事实上，去年中国企业利润率仅为6 % ， 前500大企业（大部分为国有企业）利润率勉强超过2 % 。
Meanwhile, interest rates on bank loans to nonfinancial enterprises remain close to 7%, despite having fallen slightly over the last year.	与此同时，尽管叫去年略有下降，非金融企业银行贷款利率仍接近7 % 。
And, in the second quarter of this year, the annualized interest rate on loans to small nonfinancial corporations surpassed 25%.	此外，今年二季度，小型非金融企业贷款年化利率超过了25 % 。
With insufficient profits to use for investment, nonfinancial corporations will become increasingly dependent on external finance.	非金融企业没有足够多的利润用于投资，因而将日益依赖外部融资。
As their leverage ratios increase, so will their risk premiums, causing their borrowing costs to rise and undermining their profitability further.	随着它们的杠杆率的提高，风险溢价也会随之上升，导致他们的借贷成本升高，从而进一步制约利润率。
This destructive cycle will be difficult to break.	这一恶性循环很难打破。
For example, if companies reduce investment, they will weaken growth and boost their leverage ratio further.	比如，如果公司降低投资，就会危及增长，从而进一步增加杠杆率。
To be sure, China overcame a similar challenge in its public sector from 1998 to 2001.	诚然，中国在1998—2001年期间曾经克服过公共部门类似的挑战。
It pursued growth-boosting investment in infrastructure and real-estate development to eliminate deflation, while maintaining artificially low interest rates to contain the rise of public debt.	当时中国追求提振增长的基础设施投资和房地产开发以消除通缩，同时人为维持低利率以遏制公共债务增加。
But a lot has changed since then.	但此后形势发生了巨大的变化。
In fact, the investment-led growth model that facilitated double-digit growth in the decade after 2001 has exacerbated structural weaknesses, which must now be addressed.	事实上，在2001年后的十年中推动两位数增长的投资拉动型增长模式加剧了结构性弱点，目前已到了必须纠正的地步。
Indeed, China must stem the pace of real-estate investment, which accounted for more than 13% of GDP in recent years – a move that will undoubtedly lead to slower economic growth and, in turn, reduce the profitability of China’s nonfinancial corporates further.	事实上，中国必须遏制近几年已占GDP 13%以上的房地产投资 — — 这样做必然会导致经济增长减速，反过来进一步降低中国非金融企业的利润率。
Moreover, ongoing interest-rate liberalization – which has occurred both openly and surreptitiously – means that artificially low borrowing costs have become far more difficult to maintain.	此外，利率自由化的进行 — — 既有公开的，也有暗地的 — — 意味着人为压低的借贷成本维持难度大大加剧。
Though the People’s Bank of China still officially caps interest rates on deposits, commercial banks – in cooperation with nonbank financial institutions, especially trust companies – are using wealth-management products to attract deposits with de facto free-market interest rates.	尽管中国人民银行仍对存款利率上限实施着官方上限，但商业银行 — — 在非银行金融机构特别是信托公司的合作下 — — 正在利用理财产品以事实上的自由市场利率吸引存款。
As a result, the PBOC is losing control over interest rates on corporate loans, and thus has few options for constraining leverage ratios.	结果，中国人民银行正在失去对企业贷款利率的控制，因此也不再能够约束杠杆率。
Despite these risks, it is too early to bet on a corporate-debt crisis in China.	尽管存在这些风险，但预言中国发生企业债危机仍为时尚早。
For starters, no one knows at what corporate leverage ratio a crisis will be triggered.	首先，没人知道多高的企业杠杆率才会触发危机。
In 1996, when Japan’s public debt/GDP ratio reached 80%, many Japanese economists and officials worried about a looming crisis.	1996年，日本公共债务/GDP之比达到了80 % ， 许多日本经济学家和官员担心危机随时可能爆发。
Almost two decades later, the ratio has surpassed 200% – and still no crisis has erupted.	近二十年过去了，如今日本的这一比率已超过200 % — —但危机仍然没有爆发。
Furthermore, China has not yet completed its market-orientated reforms, which could unleash major growth potential in many areas.	此外，中国尚未完成其市场改革，这意味着它可以在诸多领域释放巨大的增长潜力。
Given the role that institutional factors play in China’s corporate-debt problem, such reforms could go a long way toward resolving it.	制度因素在中国企业债问题上仍扮演着重要角色，因此这方面的改革可以在解决企业债问题上大放异彩。
China’s leaders should take advantage of this respite from instability and low confidence to redouble their reform efforts.	中国领导人应该利用动荡和信心不足的间歇期加倍努力实施改革。
Otherwise, they can expect alarm bells to begin ringing again – and, next time, they may not have the tools they need to silence them.	否则，警钟将再次敲响 — — 而到那时就不一定有平息警报所必须的工具了。
	
The Enigma of European Defense	欧洲防务之谜
PARIS – While Europe’s citizens largely support the establishment of a common security and defense policy, most European leaders have demonstrated a clear lack of interest in creating one – including at last month’s European Council meeting.	巴黎 — — 尽管欧洲民众大抵支持制定共同的安全及防务政策，但多数欧洲领导人明显对此兴味索然 — — 上个月召开的欧洲理事会会议就是实例。
What accounts for this paradox?	是什么造成了这样的悖论？
One possible explanation is that financially strained European governments lack the means to fulfill their citizens’ expectations.	可能的解释之一是财政紧张的欧洲政府无力满足民众的愿望。
But that is unconvincing, given that the issue was framed in almost identical terms three decades ago, when budgetary constraints were not a problem.	但这种解释不够有说服力，因为30年前就已经提出过几乎相同的问题，而当时还根本不必考虑预算限制。
In fact, it could be argued that such constraints should spur, not impede, the creation of a European defense structure.	事实上，这样的限制甚至应该刺激、而不是阻碍欧洲防御机制的建设。
After all, member countries would then be able to pool their resources, harmonize programs, and rationalize costs, thereby reducing individual governments’ financial burden.	毕竟，届时成员国就能集中利用资源、协调计划、分摊费用，从而控制个别政府的财政负担。
Another, far more credible explanation is that Europeans’ interpretations of “a more active and stronger security policy” differ widely.	另外一种更为可信的解释是欧洲人对于“更积极强势安全政策”的看法大相径庭。
Indeed, current discussions in Europe concerning the use of force are dominated by three main perspectives, championed by France, the United Kingdom, and Germany.	事实上，欧洲目前有关武力的讨论主要涉及三种观点，这三种观点分别由法国、英国和德国提出。
France, which has once again intervened in Africa – this time to restore order in the Central African Republic – is the only European Union country that seems genuinely interested in satisfying popular demand for more robust European security structures.	真正愿意满足公众强化欧洲安全结构要求的唯一国家似乎是法国，不久前它已再次对非洲进行干预 — — 这次是为实现恢复中非共和国秩序的目标。
The French consider Europe to be a kind of superpower – a status that implies a corresponding military capacity.	法国将欧洲视为某种超级力量 — — 而超级力量需要具备相应的军事实力。
While this view probably stems from France’s historical political and military prowess, it also reflects the country’s current interests.	虽然这种观点可能与法国过往的政治和军事实力有关，但也反映了法国目前的利益。
As Europe’s greatest military power (despite the UK’s larger defense budget), France would play a key role in any wide-ranging European military operation.	法国是欧洲军事实力最强的国家（虽然英国国防预算的规模更大 ） ， 需要在一系列欧洲军事行动中扮演关键的角色。
The UK, for its part, shares France’s belief that military power is a prerequisite to strategic effectiveness.	英国和法国一样，相信没有军事实力就谈不上战略效率。
It claims that its opposition to a European defense structure stems from its belief that NATO – and thus the United States – is critical to European defense.	英国称之所以反对欧洲防务架构是因为相信北约 — — 还有美国 — — 是欧洲防务的关键要素。
But, given that no other EU country has seriously considered excluding NATO, this argument seems to be little more than an excuse.	但因为其他欧盟国家并没有真正考虑排斥北约，英国的说法似乎不过是一种借口。
The truth is that the only kind of defense the British accept is that conducted by a coalition of European states acting under their national flags, as occurred in Libya.	事实是英国唯一接受的防务形式是像在利比亚那样由欧洲国家联盟各自打着本国的旗号独立行动。
In the UK’s view, “European” operations should be limited to humanitarian and peacekeeping objectives.	英国认为人道主义和维和行动应该是“欧洲”行动的限度。
While it supported the fight against piracy off the Horn of Africa, that was more a policing operation than a military one, and it was guided by a shared interest in protecting trade routes from the Middle East and Asia.	虽然它支持把海盗从非洲之角赶出去，但那次行动与其说与军方有关还不如说是为了保护从中东到亚洲贸易航线共同利益的警方行动。
Germany’s vision of European defense is very different from the French and British perspectives.	德国对欧洲防务目标的看法与英法大相径庭。
Unlike the UK, Germany supports a European security and defense policy, proudly highlighting its consistent military budget and major presence in European missions (larger than that of the overstretched French).	和英国不同，德国支持欧洲安全与防务政策，自豪地炫耀自己稳定的军事预算和在欧洲行动中所起的重要作用（德国的作用超过捉襟见肘的法国 ） 。
And, though Germany shares the UK’s belief that NATO bears primary responsibility for protecting Europe, its view of European engagement is even more restrictive.	而且，尽管德国同意英国保卫欧洲责任主要由北约承担的观点，但其欧洲参与观点的限制性更加严格。
In Germany’s view, European military intervention should be limited to the continent, and should not include combat operations.	德国认为欧洲军事干预应当局限在欧洲大陆，而且不应该参与战斗行动。
In fact, a majority of Europe’s citizens prefer that European forces be deployed only for non-combat missions.	事实上，欧洲多数民众倾向于欧洲军队仅限于执行非战斗任务。
And, so far, virtually all European military operations have been aimed at evacuating European nationals, delivering humanitarian aid, or maintaining peace in the aftermath of conflict.	而且，迄今为止，欧洲几乎所有军事行动都是为了保障欧洲国民的安全撤离，此外还包括提供人道主义援助或在冲突爆发后进行维和。
These differing views explain the uncertainty surrounding France’s recent interventions in Africa.	这些不同意见解释了法国不久前非洲干预行动的不确定性。
The French have lamented the miniscule support offered by the rest of Europe for its operations in Mali and the Central African Republic – exemplified by Germany’s refusal to create a fund for EU member-state operations.	法国人感叹欧洲其他国家对其马里和中非共和国行动给予的支持微乎其微 — — 德国拒绝设立欧盟成员国行动基金就是最好的例子。
But, given the urgency of the situations in Libya, Mali, and the Central African Republic, this lack of support has not undermined France’s efforts as much as prior consultation with European leaders would have done.	但是，鉴于利比亚、马里及中非共和国事态的紧迫性，这种支持的欠缺并没有给法国军事行动带来事先咨询欧洲领导人意见那样的困扰。
Had the Germans been consulted, they probably would have rejected the interventions anyway.	如果事先征询德国的意见，他们很可能会拒绝进行干预行动。
This conflict between the need for rapid response and the requirement for deliberation explains why the EU’s much-discussed “battlegroups” are unlikely ever to be deployed.	这种快速反应和深思熟虑之间的冲突说明了欧盟讨论最多的“战斗群”为什么永远不可能真正部署。
The fact that most Europeans are satisfied with limited political and military involvement outside of Europe makes increased defense cooperation even less likely.	多数欧洲人满足于对欧洲以外事务进行有限政治和军事干预的现实导致增强防务合作的可能性进一步减小。
A pessimist would say that Europeans are unable – or at least unwilling – to rethink their defense policy, because the US ultimately ensures their security through NATO.	悲观主义者会说欧洲人不能 — — 或者至少不愿 — — 重新思考其防御政策，因为美国最终通过北约保障了他们的安全需求。
According to this view, France’s efforts to encourage both transatlantic integration and autonomous political action are insufficient to change most Europeans’ minds.	按照这种说法，法国促进跨大西洋一体化和自治政治行动的努力并不足以改变多数欧洲人的想法。
A more optimistic interpretation is that Europe needs defense structures that account for the role of member states – not just for that of the EU.	更乐观的解释是欧洲需要其防御机制在明确欧盟作用的同时明确各成员国作用。
From this perspective, Europe does have a significant military presence, whether in Afghanistan and Libya or Mali and the Central African Republic.	从这个角度看，欧洲的确扮演了重要的军事角色，无论在阿富汗、利比亚还是马里和中非共和国。
That is a start.	这不过是个开头。
	
The GDP-Wellbeing Gap	GDP-幸福差异
KUALA LUMPUR – The link between economic growth and human wellbeing seems obvious.	吉隆坡—经济增长和人类幸福之间的联系似乎是显而易见的。
Indeed, as measured by gross domestic product, economic growth is widely viewed as the ultimate development objective.	事实上，用国内生产总值衡量的经济增长被广泛认为是终极发展目标。
But it is time to rethink this approach.	应该反思一下这一观点。
In fact, there is a rising disconnect between countries’ per capita GDP and their citizens’ wellbeing, as rapid output growth exacerbates health challenges and erodes environmental conditions.	事实上，一国人均GDP与其人民幸福之间的联系正在日渐减弱，因为快速增长的产出放大了健康挑战、侵蚀了环境条件。
Given this, people increasingly value non-material wealth just as highly as monetary wealth, if not more.	因此，人们日益向看重货币财富那样看重非物质财富。
But persuading policymakers and politicians of GDP’s limitations is no easy feat.	但说服决策者和政客接受GDP的局限决非易事。
After all, it is far simpler to defend a well-understood, long-accepted framework than it is to champion a new worldview.	毕竟，捍卫一个易于理解并且被长期接受的框架比提出一套新的世界观简单得多。
To be sure, GDP provides valuable information about a country’s production, expenditure, and income streams, as well as the flow of goods across borders.	平心而论，GDP提供了关于一国生产、支出和收入流以及跨境商品流的极有价值的信息。
Moreover, it has provided crucial guidance to countries, helping them to track economic gains that have improved citizens’ quality of life considerably – in many cases lifting them out of destitution.	此外，GDP还为各国提供关键指导，有助于它们追踪极大改善公民生活质量 — — 在许多情形里，还帮助他们摆脱了贫困 — — 的经济成果。
But GDP fails to account for changes in a country’s stock of assets, making it difficult for policymakers to balance economic, social, and environmental concerns.	但GDP没有考虑一国资本存量的变化，导致决策者难以平衡经济、社会和环境问题。
Without better measures of wellbeing – including health, education, and the state of the natural environment – policymakers cannot gain the insights that they need to ensure the long-term health of the economy and the individuals who comprise it.	没有更好的幸福指标 — — 包括健康、教育和自然环境状态等 — — 决策者就无法获得所需的信息确保经济以及组成经济的个体的长期健康。
This imperative underpins the concept of “sustainable development,” which has gradually gained acceptance since its introduction in the mid-1980’s.	这一紧迫任务便是“可持续发展”概念的基础。 自20世纪80年代中期引入以来，这一概念逐渐获得了接受。
But, even as countries have recognized the need for a more comprehensive understanding of development, they have largely retained GDP growth as their central objective.	但是，尽管各国已经认识到需要更全面地理解发展，但大体上它们仍将GDP增长作为核心目标。
This has to change.	这一点必须改变。
Even US-based Nobel laureate Simon Kuznets, the depression-era father of GDP, said in 1934 that, “the welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measure of national income.”	就连大萧条时期的GDP之父、美国诺贝尔奖获得者西蒙·库兹涅茨（Simon Kuznets）也曾在1934年说过“一国的福利很难从国民收入指标中推断 。 ”
The good news is that a robust, simple, and effective framework for measuring sustainability already exists.	好消息是一个鲁棒、简单、有效的可持续性衡量框架已经存在了。
Developed by a group of leading economists, including the Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow and Partha Dasgupta of the University of Cambridge, it assesses an economy’s income flows in the context of its stocks of assets, including human and natural capital.	由包括诺贝尔奖获得者肯尼斯·阿罗（Kenneth Arrow）和剑桥大学的帕莎·达斯古帕塔（Partha Dasgupta）在内的著名经济学家所开发的这一框架在一国的资产存量（包括人力和自然资本）背景下评估经济的收入流。
In other words, it accounts for the economy’s productive base, rather than just its monetary wealth.	换句话说，它计算经济的生产基础，而不仅仅是它的货币财富。
Based on this framework, United Nations University and the UN Environment Program unveiled the Inclusive Wealth Report (IWR) at the 2012 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.	基于这一框架，联合国大学和联合国环境署在2012年里约热内卢地球峰会上发布了包容性财富报告（Inclusive Wealth Report ） 。
By providing a long-term comparison between GDP and “inclusive wealth” for 20 countries, the report aimed to motivate policymakers to take a more comprehensive, longer-term view of their economies’ development.	报告给出了20个国家的长期GDP和“包容性财富”对比，旨在鼓励决策者采取更全面、更长期的经济发展观。
This November, a second IWR will be released, with many more countries represented and a stronger focus on human capital in national-account indicators.	今年11月将发布第二份包容性财富报告，报告将增加很多国家的数据，并更关注国民账户指标中的人力资本。
To this end, collaborating experts will convene in Malaysia this month for a series of meetings, culminating in a public symposium entitled “Beyond Gross Domestic Product – Transitioning into Sustainability.”	在这方面，合作专家将于本月在马来西亚召开系列会议，并出版题为《超越国内生产总值 — — 向可持续性转变 》 （ Beyond Gross Domestic Product – Transitioning into Sustainability）的专题文集。
Transforming the world’s understanding of economic development requires a dynamic approach.	转变世界对经济发展的理解需要动态方法。
Experts in various fields – including economics, sociology, psychology, and the natural sciences – must work together to develop an integrated suite of indicators that provides a comprehensive picture of humanity’s productive base, on which people’s ability to pursue their interpretation of success depends.	各个领域的专家 — — 包括经济学、社会学、心理学和自然科学 — — 必须合作开发一系列指标，全面勾勒人类生产基础图景，作为人们解释成功的基础。
While final decisions should rest with policymakers and citizens, the process must be guided by the best available science, uncompromised by political demands or vested interests.	最终决定应取决于决策者和公民，但过程必须由最有效的科学指导，杜绝政治要求和既得利益的干扰。
Moreover, one fundamental truth must be recognized: the planet cannot accommodate high-income status for all seven billion of its inhabitants.	此外，一个根本事实必须得到承认：地球无法承受其七十亿居民全部进入高收入水平。
For every country to attain per capita GDP of $13,000 (which, according to the World Bank, delineates high-income status), global GDP would need to rise from roughly $72 trillion today to $91 trillion.	如果每个国家人均GDP都达到13,000美元（世界银行的高收入标准）的国家，全球GDP需要从今天的约72万亿美元增加到91万亿美元。
If, however, we already use the equivalent of 1.5 earths to provide the resources we consume and to absorb our waste, the planet can sustainably support a GDP of only $48-50 trillion.	但是，如果我们用了相当于1.5个地球的资源来满足我们的消费、吸收我们的浪费，那么地球只能可持续地支持48—50万亿美元的GDP。
And if the planet already exceeds its sustainable carrying capacity, we should be reducing our demands on it – not adding new ones.	如果地球已经超出了其可持续运载的能力，我们就应该削减对它的要求 — — 不再增加新要求。
Simply put, we can no longer depend on GDP growth, and the limitless wealth accumulation that it implies, to solve our social and economic problems.	简言之，我们不能再继续依赖GDP增长及其所隐含的无限财富积累来解决我们的社会和经济问题。
The world must align its value systems with this reality.	世界必须让其价值体系与这一现实协调。
We must learn to do more with less, decouple economic growth from resource consumption, and nurture the social and spiritual aspects of our existence.	我们必须学会用更少的资源做更多的事，让经济增长与资源消费脱钩，培养存在的社会和精神维度。
This shift will be impossible without fundamental changes to our education systems, political structures, and institutions.	如果没有教育体系、政治结构和制度的根本性变革，就不可能造成这一改变。
It is a tall order, but our future depends on fulfilling it.	任务是艰巨的，但我们的未来取决于能否完成这一任务。
	
A Zero-Carbon Economy Is Within Reach	零碳经济触手可及
BEIJING – When the Paris climate agreement was concluded in December 2015, almost all the world’s countries committed to limit global warming to well below 2° Celsius relative to pre-industrial levels, and have submitted “Intended Nationally Determined Contributions” (INDCs) describing how they will either contain or reduce emissions over the next decade.	发自北京 — — 当巴黎气候协议于2015年12月签署时，几乎所有世界上的国家都承诺将全球变暖程度限制在相对工业化前水平不高于2摄氏度的水平，并各自提交了《国家自主贡献》文件以解释如何在未来十年内控制或减少排放。
Global investment in renewable power now far exceeds investment in fossil fuel plants; battery costs are falling, and electric vehicle sales rising; and even in President Donald Trump’s America, coal-fired power stations continue to close.	目前，全球对可再生能源的投资远远超过对化石燃料工厂的投资；电池成本下降，电动汽车销量上升；甚至在特朗普治下美国，燃煤发电站也在陆续关停。
But despite this progress, the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) contains a chilling prediction: on current trends, the world is heading toward 3°C of global warming by 2100, to a level not reached for more than a million years.	但尽管取得了这一进展，政府间气候变化专门委员会最新发布的报告仍然做出一个令人不寒而栗的预测：就目前的趋势而言，到2100年时世界会升温达3摄氏度，也是超过100万年来都未曾达到的水平。
The harm to human welfare is likely to be catastrophic.	对人类福利而言，这可能是灾难性的。
The IPCC report makes it clear that the ideal target should be to limit warming to 1.5°C. Above that level, the adverse consequences become ever more extreme.	委员会报告明确指出理想的目标应该是将升温限制在1.5摄氏度。 一旦超过这个水平则后果将变得更为极端。
But to achieve that goal, global carbon dioxide emissions would have to reach net zero by about 2055, and still earlier if, as is unfortunately inevitable, emissions remain at current levels for several more years.	但要实现这一目标，全球二氧化碳排放量必须在2055年左右达到净零水平，而鉴于排放量会可悲且不可避免地在目前水平上保持多几年，所以这一目标还得相应提前。
The precise implications for acceptable emissions from power stations, industrial plants, transport networks, and heating systems depend on how rapidly emissions caused by land-use change such as deforestation can be eliminated, and how rapidly emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases (for example, methane or nitrous oxide) can be reduced.	而发电站，工业厂房，运输网络和供暖系统的被许可排放的确切影响则取决于由森林砍伐等土地性质变化所造成的排放可以以多快的速度被消除，以及非二氧化碳温室气体（比如甲烷或氧化亚氮）的排放减少速度。
But it’s clear that unless we get to net zero emissions from energy use and industry by around 2060 – and earlier in developed economies – we will have to rely on the risky assumption that land-use changes can deliver large negative emissions in the late twenty-first century.	但很显然的是，除非我们在2060年左右实现能源使用和工业的净零排放 — — 而且发达经济体还要提早一些 — — 否则就将不得不依赖于可能站不住脚的假设，即土地使用变化可以在21世纪末产生大量的负排放。
Failing that, warming will rise significantly above 1.5°C.	如果做不到这一点，气温将在1.5摄氏度以上显著上升。
Getting to net zero emissions in just four decades will be a huge challenge.	在短短四十年内实现净零排放将是一个巨大的挑战。
But as a forthcoming report from the Energy Transitions Commission argues, the good news is that it is undoubtedly technically possible, and at an acceptably low cost to the global economy.	但正如能源转型委员会即将发布的一份报告所指出的那样，好消息是它在技术上无疑是可行的，而且为全球经济带来的成本也可以接受。
Moreover, we already know the key technologies we need to achieve this objective.	此外我们已经知晓了实现这一目标所需的关键技术。
All feasible paths to a low-carbon economy and, eventually, net zero CO2 emissions require a massive increase in the role of electricity.	通往低碳经济（以及最终的零二氧化碳净排放）的所有可行途径都需要大力提升电力的作用。
The share of electricity in final energy demand will have to grow from around 20% today to around 60% by mid- to late century, and total global electricity generation will have to rise dramatically, from around 25,000 TWh today to as much as 100,000 TWh.	最终能源需求中的电力份额必须由当前的约20％增长到本世纪中后期的60％左右，为此全球总发电量必须大幅增加，从目前的约2.5万太瓦时增加到10万太瓦时。
That electricity must come from low-carbon sources.	而这些电力必须来自低碳源头。
And while nuclear power and gas generation offset by carbon capture may play a role, the lion’s share will have to come from renewable sources – 70-80% in the IPCC’s scenarios.	虽然核电以及被碳捕获所抵消的天然气发电可能起到一定作用，但最大的份额必须来自可再生能源 — — 在政府间气候变化专门委员会设定的情景中占到70~80 ％ 。
But there is plenty enough land in the world to support renewable expansion on that scale, and enough time to make the necessary investments as long as we act fast.	但其实世界上有足够的土地支持这种规模的可再生能源扩张，只要我们采取快速行动，就有足够的时间进行必要的投资。
Three other sets of technologies will also be essential.	另外三套技术也是必不可少的。
First, hydrogen, ammonia, and perhaps methanol must be used as energy carriers in transport and industrial applications and as chemical feedstock inputs.	首先，氢气，氨气和甲醇必须被用作运输和工业应用中的能量载体以及化学原料输入。
All three will eventually be produced synthetically, using clean electricity as the ultimate energy source.	所有这三种产物最终将实现合成生产，并使用清洁电力作为最终能源。
Second, biomass could provide low-carbon aviation fuel, or feedstock for plastics production.	其次，生物质可以用来提供低碳航空燃料或用作塑料生产原料。
The total scale of use, however, will need to be carefully managed to avoid harmful impacts on ecosystems and food supply.	但同时需要谨慎管理其总使用规模以避免对生态系统和粮食供应产生有害影响。
Third, there should be at least some role for carbon capture, and either storage or use, in key industrial processes such as cement production, where viable alternative routes to decarbonization are currently unavailable.	第三，在水泥生产等关键工业生产流程中碳捕获（不管是储存还是使用）都至少应该起到一定的作用，因为目前在这些行业还未能开发出可行的脱碳替代路径。
Building a zero-carbon economy will of course require massive investment in power production and transmission, new industrial plants, and more efficient equipment.	同时建立零碳经济当然需要在电力生产和输电，新工厂和更高效设备方面进行大量投资。
To achieve the 1.5°C objective, the IPCC estimates that the required additional global investment, from 2015 to 2050, could be $900 billion per annum.	政府间气候变化专门委员会预计，为达到1.5摄氏度的目标就必须在2015~2050年间在全球范围内每年追加投资达9000亿美元。
That may seem like a startlingly high figure; but, assuming 3% annual economic growth, global GDP, which stands at almost $100 trillion today, could reach $260 trillion by 2050.	这可能看起来像一个惊人的数字；但假设年经济增长率达到3 ％ ， 那么当前累计近100万亿美元的全球GDP到2050年时将达260万亿美元。
This implies that the world needs to invest less than 0.6% of its income over the next four decades to avoid potentially catastrophic harm to human welfare.	这意味着世界只需要在未来40年内投入不到0.6％的收入就可以避免对人类福祉的潜在灾难性伤害。
China alone currently invests more than $5 trillion each year, a significant proportion of which is wasted on the construction of apartment blocks which will never be occupied in cities which face static and eventually declining populations.	仅中国一国每年的投资额就超过5万亿美元，只不过其中绝大部分都被浪费在了一些永远不会有人居住的公寓楼建设上 — — 它们所在的城市走向寂静且最终人口下降。
By redirecting investment, China could build a zero-carbon economy without any sacrifice of consumption.	通过重新定向投资，中国可以在不牺牲消费的情况下建立零碳经济。
For the world as a whole, the impact on living standards of achieving net zero emissions will be trivial.	对整个世界而言，实现净零排放对生活水平的影响微不足道。
But while a zero-carbon economy is undoubtedly technically feasible and easily affordable, it will not be achieved without strong public policies and forward-looking business strategies.	而虽然零碳经济显然在技术上可行且经济上负担得起，但如果没有强有力的公共政策和前瞻性的商业战略就无法实现。
Governments must deliver carbon pricing and product regulation and support key technologies and infrastructures, and companies in the energy-producing and main energy-using sectors must develop strategies focused on how to achieve zero emissions by mid-century and how to begin the transition today.	政府必须提供碳定价和产品监管并支持关键技术和基础设施，能源生产和主要能源使用部门的企业必须制定战略，重点关注如何在本世纪中叶实现零排放以及如何立刻开始转型。
The alternative is another decade of only incremental progress, which will put us on a catastrophic path toward 3°C warming within the lifetime of today’s children.	而另一种选择是继续度过一个仅有渐进式进步的十年，而我们的孩子们也会在有生之年走上3摄氏度升温的灾难性道路。
	
The Zero-Sum Economy	零和经济
LONDON – Across the global economy, the potential for automation seems huge.	发自伦敦 — — 纵观全球经济，自动化的潜力似乎相当大。
Adidas’ “Speedfactory” in Bavaria will employ 160 workers to produce 500,000 pairs of shoes each year, a productivity rate over five times higher than in typical factories today.	阿迪达斯设在德国巴伐利亚州的“速度工厂”鞋履年生产量达50万双，但只需雇佣160名工人，生产率比目前典型的工厂要高出五倍。
The British Retail Consortium estimates that retail jobs could fall from three million to 2.1 million within ten years, with only a small fraction replaced by new jobs in online retailing.	英国零售商协会预计零售业岗位数量可能会在未来十年内从300万减少到210万，而且其中只有一小部分被在线零售业的新职位所取代。
Many financial-services companies see the potential to cut information-processing jobs to a small fraction of current levels.	许多金融服务企业也觉得可以将信息处理员工的数量削减到当前水平的几分之一。
And yet, despite all this, measured productivity growth across the developed economies has slowed.	可即便如此，发达经济体的生产率增长速度依然在走下坡路。
One possible explanation, recently considered by Andrew Haldane, chief economist of the Bank of England, is that while some companies rapidly grasp the new opportunities, others do so only slowly, producing a wide productivity dispersion even within the same sector.	对此英格兰银行首席经济学家安德鲁·霍尔丹（Andrew Haldane）最近思考得出的一个可能的解释是，虽然一些公司迅速把握住了新的机遇，但其他公司却反应迟钝，即使在同一行业部门内也会产生广泛的生产率不均状况。
But dispersion alone cannot explain slowing productivity growth: that would require an increase in the degree of dispersion.	但仅仅是不均还无法解释生产率增长放缓：因为这还需要提升不均的程度。
However, to focus on how technology is applied to existing jobs may be to look in the wrong place, for the clue to the productivity paradox may instead be found in the activities to which displaced workers move.	然而，关注技术如何应用​​于那些现有就业职位可能是在错误的，因为这种生产率悖论的线索反而可能在那些失业工人的活动中找到。
David Graeber of the London School of Economics argues that as much as 30% of all work is performed in “bullshit jobs,” which are unnecessary to produce truly valuable goods and services but arise from competition for income and status.	伦敦经济学院的大卫·格雷伯（David Graeber）认为有多达30％的工作都是以“垃圾工作（bullshit jobs ） ” 的形式存在，这些工作不会生产真正有价值的商品和服务，而只是在争夺收入和地位。
Graeber usefully views the world from the perspective of an anthropologist, not an economist.	格雷伯的可贵之处在于从人类学家而非经济学家的角度去观察这个世界。
But the phrase “bullshit jobs” and his focus on demotivated workers doing pointless work may divert attention from the essential development: individual workers may regard as stimulating and valuable many jobs which cannot in aggregate contribute to total welfare.	但是“垃圾工作”这一短语以及他对那些无精打采地从事着无意义工作的人们的关注可能会转移了我们对基本发展的注意力：许多工作可能在总体上无益于全体福利，但在个人看来却是既振奋人心又有价值的。
Suppose, for example, that you cared passionately about the objectives of a particular charity, had a flair for fundraising, and successfully increased that charity’s share of available donations.	比如说，假设您对某个慈善机构所设立的目标非常热衷，同时又拥有筹款的天赋，并成功增加了该机构在总体善款中所占的份额。
You would probably feel both motivated and good, even if all you had done was divert money from another charity about which another equally motivated fundraiser was equally passionate.	即使您所做的一切都是从另一个慈善机构 — — 其背后也有另一个同样富有冲劲且同样充满激情的筹款者 — — 把钱挪过来，您可能依然会感到既踌躇满志又造福人类。
The crucial economic question, therefore, is not whether individual jobs are “bullshit,” but whether they increasingly perform a zero-sum distributive function, whereby the dedication of ever more skill, effort, and technology cannot increase human welfare, given the skill, effort, and technology applied on the other side of the competitive game.	可见关键的经济问题并不是一个人工作是否“垃圾 ” ， 而在于他们是否越来越多地在执行着零和式的分配功能，其所贡献的更多技能，努力和技术都无法增加人类福祉，而是被用在了竞争游戏的某一个对立面。
Numerous jobs fall into that category: cyber criminals and the cyber experts employed by companies to repel their attacks; lawyers (both personal and corporate); much of financial trading and asset management; tax accountants and revenue officials; advertising and marketing to build brand X at the expense of brand Y; rival policy campaigners and think tanks; even teachers seeking to ensure that their students achieve the higher relative grades that underpin future success.	许多工作都属于这一范畴：网络犯罪分子和企业雇用去击退这类他们的网络专家；律师（无论是为个人还是企业服务的 ） ； 大部分金融交易和资产管理；税务会计师和税务官员；以牺牲品牌Y为代价建立品牌X的广告和营销；针锋相对的政策活动家和智库；甚至是那些希望确保自己学生拿到相对更高分数从而迈向光明未来的教师。
Measuring what share of all economic activity is zero sum is inherently difficult.	衡量所有经济活动中究竟有多大比例属于零和本身就极为困难。
Many jobs involve both truly creative and merely distributive activities.	许多工作都会涉及真正创造性以及纯粹分配性的活动。
And zero-sum activities can be found in all sectors; manufacturing companies can employ tax accountants to minimize liabilities and top executives who focus on financial engineering.	在各行各业中都可以找到零和活动；一个制造企业可以聘请帮忙减少应缴税费的税务会计师以及专注于金融工程的高级管理人员。
But available figures suggest that zero-sum activities have grown significantly.	但现有数据显示零和活动正在显著增长。
As Gary Hamel and Michele Zanini point out in a recent Harvard Business Review article, some 17.6% of all US jobs, receiving 30% of all compensation, are in “management and administrative” functions likely to involve significant zero-sum activity.	正如加里·汉梅尔（Gary Hamel）和米盖尔·扎尼尼（Michele Zanini）最近发表的《哈佛商业评论》文章中所指出的那样，美国所有就业岗位中约有17.6 ％ （ 占总薪酬的30 ％ ） 属于可能涉及大量零和活动的“管理和行政”职能 ， 。
Meanwhile employment in financial and “business services” firms has grown from 15% to 18% of all US jobs in the last 20 years, and from 20% to 24% of measured output.	与此同时，金融和“商业服务”类公司的就业人数占美国就业岗位的比例在过去20年中从15％增长到了18 ％ ， 其占总经济产出的比率则从20％增加到了24 ％ 。
Hamel and Zanini argue that if we could only strip out unnecessary management jobs, productivity could soar.	汉梅尔和扎尼尼认为只要我们能剥离掉那些毫无必要的管理工作，生产力就会飙升。
But the growth of zero-sum activities may be more inherent than they believe.	但零和活动的增长可能比他们认为的更为根深蒂固。
As technological progress makes us ever richer in terms of many basic goods and services – whether cars or household appliances, restaurant meals or mobile phone calls – it may be inevitable that more human activity is devoted to zero-sum competition for available income and assets.	随着技术进步使我们在许多基本商品和服务方面变得更加宽裕 — — 无论是汽车还是家用电器，餐馆用餐还是移动电话 — — 更多的人类活动也不可避免地被用于针对现有收入和资产进行零和竞争。
As our ability to produce higher-quality goods with fewer people increases, value may come to lie more and more in subjective brands, and rational firms will devote resources to activities like market analysis, financial engineering, and tax planning.	随着我们以更少人员生产更高质量商品的能力不断提升，价值可能越来越多地体现在主观性的品牌之上，而那些理性企业则会把资源投入到市场分析，金融工程和税收筹划等活动中。
Eventually, almost all human work might be devoted to zero-sum activities.	最终几乎所有的人类工作都可能被用于零和活动。
Whether or not robots will ever achieve human-level intelligence, it is illuminating to consider what an economy would look like if we could automate almost all the work required to produce the goods and services human welfare requires.	在此我们可以思考一个具有启发性的问题：无论机器人是否能够达到跟人类同等的智能，如果我们能够自动完成人类福利所需的产品和服务所需的几乎所有工作，那时的经济将会是什么样子呢？
There are two possibilities: one is a dramatic increase in leisure; the other is that ever more work would be devoted to zero-sum competition.	这有两种可能性：一个是闲余时间急剧增加；另一个是更多的工作将用于零和竞争。
Given what we know about human nature, the second development seems likely to play a significant role.	依我们对人性的了解，第二种走向似乎将发挥重要作用。
As I argued in a recent lecture, such an economy would probably be a very unequal one, with a small number of IT experts, fashion designers, brand creators, lawyers, and financial traders earning enormous incomes.	正如我在最近的一次讲座中所说，这样的经济可能是一个非常不平等的经济体，少数IT专家，时装设计师，品牌创造者，律师和金融交易者赚取了巨额收入。
Paradoxically, the most physical thing of all – locationally desirable land – would dominate asset values, and rules on inheritance would be a key determinant of relative wealth.	矛盾的是，最具有物理意义的东西 — — 那些位置理想的土地 — — 将主导资产价值，而继承规则将成为相对财富的关键决定因素。
In John Maynard Keynes’s words, we would have solved “the economic problem” of how to produce as many goods and services as we want , but would face the more difficult and essentially political questions of how to achieve meaning in a world where work is no longer needed, and how to govern fairly the inherent human tendency toward status competition.	照约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯的话来说，我们已经解决了如何按照自己的意愿去尽可能多地生产商品和服务的“经济问题 ” ， 但是在一个不再需要工作的世界里，我们将面临着如何实现人生意义这个更加困难和根本的政治问题，以及如何公平地治理人类内在的地位竞争倾向。
Seeking to resolve these challenges through accelerated technological development and faster productivity growth would be like pursuing a mirage.	而试图寻求通过加速技术开发和更快的生产力增长来解决这些挑战则无异于猴子捞月。
	
Zika and Reproductive Rights	寨卡和生育权
NEW YORK – Mosquitoes know no boundaries, and neither does fear.	纽约—蚊子不知道有国界这回事，也不懂得恐慌。
As public-health experts grapple with the Zika virus, panic continues to spread around the world.	如今，公共卫生专家正在集中关注寨卡病毒，而恐惧继续在全世界蔓延。
Yet the crisis has brought to light two important truths.	但这场危机让我们看到了两个重要事实。
The first revelation is how badly degraded public health systems have become, across Latin America and beyond.	第一个事实是拉丁美洲和其他地区公共卫生体系倒退严重。
This did not happen by chance.	这绝不是偶然。
In large part, it is the result of pressure on developing countries by concessionary lenders, such as the International Monetary Fund, to cut social sector expenses, including health spending, beginning in 1980.	从很大程度上说，这是拜国际货币基金（IMF）等优惠贷款人所赐。 从1980年开始，这些优惠贷款人施加越来越大的压力要求削减社会部门支出，包括卫生支出。
In Brazil and elsewhere, state authorities could have deployed well-known and cost-effective measures to control mosquito-borne diseases, but they did not.	在巴西和其他国家，有关部门本来能力部署著名的高性价比措施控制蚊子传播的传染病，但它们没有这样做。
Their most affected citizens, who tend to be poor, have been forced to live with the consequences.	而受影响最大的国民往往是穷人，他们被迫承受后果。
Second, the Zika epidemic has revealed, with particular poignancy, another dire threat to public health: the denial of women’s reproductive rights.	其次，尤其讽刺的是，寨卡疫情曝光了另外一个公共卫生的严峻威胁：剥夺妇女生育权。
Governments are shirking their responsibility in this regard too, often in a grotesque manner.	政府在这方面也在推脱责任，手段往往荒唐。
The reported spike in cases of microcephaly – a birth defect – among infants in Zika-affected areas led the governments of Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and El Salvador to warn their female citizens “not to become pregnant.”	据报道，寨卡疫区婴儿小头症（一种出生缺陷）概率飙升让巴西、哥伦比亚、厄瓜多尔和萨尔瓦多政府警告女性公民“不要怀孕 ” 。
This message, which places the blame and burden of the Zika epidemic on women, is as unjust as it is unreasonable.	这一做法将寨卡疫情的责任和负担都推给了妇女，是不公平也不合理的。
It is also toothless, as many women in the region do not have access to contraception or safe abortions.	这也是无能的表现，因为该地区许多妇女根本无法获得避孕和安全堕胎。
The Zika crisis has highlighted an obvious reality: Not providing women with reproductive health information and services places their lives – and those of their children – at grave risk.	寨卡危机彰显出一个显而易见的现实：不向妇女提供生殖健康信息和服务让她们 — — 以及她们的孩子 — — 的生命处于非常危险的境地。
Latin America’s abortion laws are among the world’s most restrictive.	拉丁美洲的堕胎法堪称世界最严。
El Salvador, for example, bans abortion in all circumstances and has incarcerated women who have gone to emergency rooms after miscarriages, charging them with seeking illegal abortions.	比如，萨尔瓦多禁止一切情况下的堕胎行为，任何妇女，如果她因为流产而进入急诊室，都会遭到监禁，被控试图非法堕胎。
Contraception can also be expensive or difficult to access across the region, despite high rates of teenage rape and pregnancy.	避孕在该地区也很昂贵并且很难获得，尽管青少年强奸和怀孕现象十分普遍。
The result, especially with the addition of the Zika virus, is a recipe for tragedy.	结果是反复发生悲剧，特别是在寨卡病毒爆发的情况下。
Brazil, the Latin American country hit hardest by the virus so far, is emblematic of the problem: Abortion is allowed only in cases of rape, danger to the woman’s life, or in the case of fetal anencephaly (the absence of a major portion of the brain).	目前，拉丁美洲受寨卡病毒影响最大的国家是巴西，它也成为这一问题的象征：堕胎只有在遭遇强奸、危及妇女生命或致命无脑儿（缺少大脑的主要部分）等情况才被允许。
In response to the Zika crisis, Brazil should immediately allow abortion in cases of suspected microcephaly as well.	为了应对寨卡危机，巴西应该立刻允许疑似小脑症的情况也进行堕胎。
The loosening of restrictions, however, should not stop there.	但是，放松限制不能仅限于此。
Over the last few years, conservatives in the Brazilian Congress have been trying to place limits on abortion in cases of rape.	在过去几年中，巴西国会中的保守派一直在试图限制被强奸后堕胎。
These efforts – which demonstrate complete disregard for the rights and dignity of women – must end.	这些做法必须叫停，因为它们完全无视妇女的权利和尊严。
Instead, women’s right to seek an abortion should be expanded – and quickly.	相反，妇女寻求堕胎的权利应该扩大 — — 迅速扩大。
Governments must also ensure that services are accessible and affordable.	政府还必须确保服务能得到普及和平价化。
Wealthy Brazilian women can afford to pay private health providers for safe abortions.	富裕的巴西妇女能够负担私人安全��胎服务。
Poor women are forced to resort to poorly trained and equipped providers who operate in unsanitary conditions, sometimes as part of criminal networks.	贫困女性被迫在技术低劣、设备落后的诊所（有时甚至是犯罪团伙）在不卫生的条件下接受堕胎手术。
In September 2014, two women died in Rio de Janeiro following clandestine abortions.	2014年9月，两名妇女在里约热内卢接受地下脱胎后死亡。
In the region overall, 95% of abortions are unsafe.	在整个地区，95%的堕胎为不安全堕胎。
In Latin America and the Caribbean, 62% of women aged 15-49 want to avoid a pregnancy.	在拉丁美洲和加勒比海地区，62%的15—49岁女性希望避免怀孕。
But nearly a quarter of these women are not using an effective method of birth control.	但这些女性中有近四分之一用不上有效的生育控制方法。
Expense is only one barrier for poor women and girls; another is the lack of information.	对贫困妇女和女孩来说，开支只是其中一个壁垒；另一个壁垒是信息不通。
Men and women need comprehensive sexuality education, so they are informed about their reproductive health and family planning options and know where they can get modern contraceptives.	女性和女性都需要全面的性教育，这样才能了解自己的生殖卫生条件和家庭规划选择，知道如何获得现代避孕技术。
Recent evidence suggesting that Zika might be transmitted sexually adds extra urgency to making male and female condoms and other contraceptives widely available.	最新证据显示，寨卡病毒可能经由性途径传播，这更加增加了普及男用和女用避孕套和其他避孕手段的紧迫性。
The movement for reproductive rights has a long history in Brazil and in other parts of Latin America.	生育权运动在巴西和其他拉丁美洲国家由来已久。
Over the last several months – even before Zika – feminists had been taking to the streets in outrage at the lack of access to safe and legal abortions.	在过去几个月中 — — 甚至在寨卡病毒爆发前 — — 女权主义者一直在举行街头游行愤怒地倾诉她们无法获得安全和合法的堕胎。
The Zika crisis may mark a turning point in the fight for women’s health and equality.	寨卡危机可能是妇女卫生和平等地位斗争的转折点。
It is certainly a wake-up call for governments everywhere to rebuild and strengthen public health systems, and to guarantee all women and girls access to contraceptives and safe abortions.	它毫无疑问是所有国家的警钟：必须重建和强化公共卫生系统，并保证所有妇女和女孩获得避孕和安全堕胎。
Women and girls around the world know the alternative – and it is terrifying.	全世界妇女和女孩都知道否则的话会怎样 — — 令人颤抖。
	
The Injustices of Zika	寨卡的不公平
SOUTHAMPTON – Outbreaks of communicable diseases in the developing world are bad enough from a health perspective.	南安普顿—从卫生角度讲，发展中世界传染病爆发已经足够糟糕了。
But they also have serious implications for social justice, because they exacerbate longstanding human-rights crises, including by undermining already-weak public-services provision and deepening existing inequalities.	但它们还给社会公平带来了严重后果，因为它们加剧了存在已久的人道危机，包括恶化已经非常孱弱的公共服务供给和深化不平等性。
Like the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the Zika outbreak in Central and South America in 2015 hit vulnerable social groups – women and children, ethnic minorities, and the poor – the hardest.	和2014年西非埃博拉爆发一样，2015年寨卡在中南美洲的爆发，首当其冲的也是社会弱势群体 — — 妇女和儿童、少数民族以及穷人。
Like yellow fever, dengue, and other diseases, Zika is transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.	和黄热病、登革热和其他疾病一样，寨卡由埃及伊蚊传播。
But, unusually for a mosquito-borne virus, Zika can also be transmitted sexually.	但和通常的蚊子传播的病毒不同，寨卡病毒还能通过性途径传播。
Even more unusual, it is associated with neurological and developmental conditions affecting babies: microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome.	更加反常的是，它还能影响婴儿的神经系统和发育状况，导致小头症和格林-巴利综合症。
Otherwise, its symptoms are often rather mild.	若非如此，寨卡所引起的症状通常没有什么大碍。
This means that, of the more than 1.5 million people stricken by Zika since the outbreak, the consequences were most worrying for women of child-bearing age, especially those who were already pregnant.	这意味着，在自寨卡爆发以来受其传染的150多万人中，育龄妇女的后果令人担心，特别是已经怀孕的妇女。
Between 2016 and 2017, a total of 11,059 Zika cases in pregnant women were confirmed, producing 10,867 cases of microcephaly and other congenital malformations of their babies’ central nervous systems.	2016—2017年间，共有11,059 例寨卡病例为孕妇，她们的婴儿因此出现了10,867例小头症和其他中枢神经系统先天畸形。
Fifty-six percent of those babies were born to poor women and women of color from northeast Brazil.	在这些婴儿中，有百分之六十五的母亲是穷人或有色人种，生活在巴西东北部。
Clearly,the Zika crisis is not gender-neutral.	显然，寨卡危机不是性别中性的。
In addressing its medium- to long-term consequences, a focus on women – especially poor women – is needed.	要解决它的中长期影响，就必须以妇女特别是贫穷妇女为焦点。
That does not mean more media coverage of the deformities associated with microcephaly or even of the difficulties faced by their mothers.	这并不意味着媒体更多地报道与小头症有关的畸形甚至这些婴儿的母亲面临的困难。
And it certainly does not mean more efforts to police women’s behavior.	这也绝非意味着采取更多措施监控妇女的行为。
To avoid infection, women have been advised to use mosquito repellent; remove standing water around their homes; wear long sleeves; and, if possible, use condoms or avoid sex.	为了避免传染，妇女们常常被建议驱蚊剂、移除住处周边的死水、穿长袖衣裤，以及，如有可能，尽量使用避孕套或避免性生活。
The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention advised pregnant women to refrain from traveling to affected countries.	美国疾病控制和预防中心建议孕妇不要去受影响国家旅行。
Most extreme, health officials in El Salvador and Colombia urged women not to get pregnant until 2018.	更极端地，萨尔瓦多和哥伦比亚卫生官员要求妇女在2018年前不要怀孕。
Such recommendations, however well intended they may be, are fundamentally flawed.	不管这些建议的初衷多么良好，都存在根本性错误。
For starters, they emphasize short-term-vector control and surveillance, while delinking the disease from the social and structural determinants of health, including public infrastructure such as running water, proper sanitation, and access to care.	首先，它们强调短期的控制和监控，而没有将这种疾病和决定健康的社会和结构性因素联系起来，包括自来水、卫生设施和全民医疗等公共基础设施。
They also place the responsibility for avoiding disease and pregnancy primarily on women, while failing to recognize the lack of control many women have over their bodies and pregnancies.	它们还把避免疾病和怀孕的主要责任推卸给妇女，而没有认识到许多妇女根本没有办法控制自己的怀孕和性生活。
Many of the areas affected by Zika have high rates of sexual violence and teen pregnancy, a lack of sex education, and inadequate access to contraceptives.	许多受寨卡疫情影响的地区，性暴力和少女怀孕比例很高，性教育和避孕手段也不充分。
For these reasons, more than 50% of pregnancies in Latin America are unintended.	出于这些原因，拉丁美洲50%以上的怀孕都属于以外情况。
Making matters worse, in most Latin American countries affected by Zika, abortion is illegal, or permitted only in exceptional situations.	更糟糕的是，在大部分受寨卡疫情影响的拉美国家，堕胎是非法行为，或只在特殊情况下才能允许。
For example, in El Salvador, where more than 7,000 cases of Zika were reported between December 2015 and January 2016, abortions are illegal under all circumstances.	比如，萨尔瓦多在2015年12月到2016年1月间报告了7,000多例寨卡病例，但堕胎在这个国家是绝对禁止的。
Miscarriages, if proven to be self-induced, can even lead to homicide convictions.	甚至因自身原因造成的早产也被视为杀人。
The position of the United States hasn’t helped, either.	美国的立场也起不到帮助。
Last year, US President Barack Obama’s administration asked Congress for $1.8 billion in emergency funding to help prepare for and respond to the Zika threat.	去年，美国总统奥巴马政府要求国会紧急拨款18亿美元用于帮助准备和响应寨卡威胁。
But abortion politics intervened, as Republican lawmakers, leading a congressional hearing on the Zika outbreak, made the funding conditional on anti-abortion policies in recipient countries.	但堕胎政治干预 — — 共和党立法者领衔要求就寨卡疫情爆发进行国会听证 — — 导致拨款需要以受助国有反堕胎政策为条件。
The problems with the dominant approach to containing the Zika virus – namely, that it saddles women with too much responsibility while giving them too little power – are not lost on everyone.	遏制寨卡病毒的主要方法的问题在于它们给了妇女太多的责任和太少的权力。 并不是所有人都对此无动于衷。
Last year, the United Nations Refugee Agency and the World Health Organization emphasized the need to put human rights at the center of the response to the Zika outbreak.	去年，联合国难民署和世界卫生组织强调，必须将人权放在应对寨卡疫情爆发措施的核心。
But, while high-level recognition of women’s sexual and reproductive rights is a positive step, it is far from sufficient.	但是，尽管高屋建瓴地承认妇女的性和生殖权利是一个积极的举措，但还远远不够。
And doing what is needed to protect those rights, particularly among poor and vulnerable women in developing countries, will require deep and sustained political commitment.	而要保护这些权利，特别是发展中国家的贫穷的弱势妇女的权利，我们需要深刻的重大政治承诺。
In particular, national legislation must be revised to ensure that all women – whether they are carrying a baby with microcephaly or not – have full reproductive autonomy.	特别是，国家立法必须进行修订，以保证所有妇女 — — 不管她们的胎儿是否存在小头症 — — 都获得充分的生殖自主权。
Women must be able to base their reproductive choices on their own physical and emotional needs and desires, not on the moral judgments of powerful agents or risk of criminal sanctions.	妇女必须能够以自身身体和精神需要和渴望为基础，而不是以权力机构的道德审判和刑事制裁的风险为基础，来做出她们的生殖选择。
Advocacy groups in Brazil, for example, are already pushing for such an outcome, submitting legal cases to the Supreme Court to secure greater reproductive rights for women, including the right to safe and legal abortion.	比如，巴西的游说团体已经在推动这一结果，向最高法院递交了诉状，要求保证妇女更大的生殖权利，包括安全合法地堕胎的权利。
Those cases tend to lean on the 1988 National Constitution, which guarantees the right to abortion in case of rape, danger to the mother’s life, or anencephaly, another birth defect involving the brain.	这些诉状倾向于1988年国家宪法，其中授予妇女在遭遇强奸、面临自身生命危险或无脑畸形（另外一种关于大脑有关的缺陷）等情况时有权利选择堕胎。
In pursuing these changes, campaigns should also recognize and address the links between women’s and disability rights.	在追求这些变革目标的过程中，支持者应该认清并解决妇女和残疾权利之间的联系。
Indeed, they should advance equality for all marginalized groups.	事实上，他们应该推动所有边缘群体获得平等权利。
Zika’s medium- and long-term consequences must be addressed with this in mind.	寨卡的中长期后果比依靠这样的思路来解决。
When a woman gives birth to a child with a congenital syndrome deriving from the Zika virus, the response should be grounded in the dignity, value, and rights of each individual.	当妇女生下因为寨卡病毒而存在先天性疾病的儿童时，其应对手段应该基于尊严、价值观和个体权利。
It should acknowledge the processes that keep certain individuals and groups in poverty and that deny them the basic rights of citizens.	应该认识到，现在的程序让一些个体和群体陷入了贫困，剥夺了他们的基本公民权利。
That is why campaigners must insist that the state be responsible for providing appropriate care and support services for each woman and child – services that both meet their needs and respect their rights.	因此，我的支持者必须坚持，国家要负责为每位妇女和儿童提供合适的医疗和支持服务 — — 这些服务既要满足他们的需要，也要尊重他们的权利。
	
Zimbabwe's Last Chance	津巴布韦的最后机会
As the world rooted for former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan in his recent efforts to end the violence in Kenya, many also found themselves wondering whether a weary Annan, or some other global leader, will be battling another fire by the end of this month: this time in Zimbabwe.	尽管全世界都大力支持联合国前秘书长安南最近为结束肯尼亚的暴乱而进行的努力，但是许多人还是不禁会疑问疲倦的安南或者另一位世界领导人能够扑灭这个月底将会发生的另一场大火吗？ 这一次是在津巴布韦。
Zimbabwe’s upcoming elections, scheduled for March 29, offer both fear and hope to the millions trapped in or trying to escape the country’s hellish conditions.	津巴布韦将于3月29日举行的大选给数百万深陷于或者试图逃脱这个国家可怕的环境的人们既带来了担忧，也带来了希望。
Even official data now put the inflation rate at more than 100,000%, and the plight of ordinary Zimbabweans grows more desperate by the day.	即便根据官方的数据，那里的通货膨胀率也超过了100000 % ， 而普通的津巴布韦人所面临的困境正在日益加剧。
The elections could bring Zimbabweans a chance to end the long dictatorship of President Robert Mugabe.	大选可以使津巴布韦人有机会终结穆加贝长期的独裁统治。
But, without supervision, they will be held in an environment that could dash Zimbabweans’ hopes.	但是在没有监督的情况下，津巴布韦人的希望很有可能会破灭。
Zimbabweans are denied their basic freedoms and subjected to violence.	津巴布韦人被剥夺了基本的自由，并且受到暴力迫害。
Torture is widespread.	滥用酷刑的现象非常普遍。
Civil society groups report the arrests of opposition electoral candidates, the manipulation of food supplies for political purposes, and violent incidents of voter intimidation.	民间社会团体报告说有反对派的候选人被拘捕、为了政治目的而控制食品的供应以及对威胁选民的暴力事件比比皆是。
The Zimbabwe Election Support Network has also expressed concern about the country’s state of readiness for this complex election, which will combine presidential, parliamentary, senatorial, and local government contests.	津巴布韦选举支持网络同样也对这个国家是否准备好迎接这场复杂的选举表示了担心。 这次选举将会选出总统、议会、参议员以及地方政府。
And this is to say nothing of the structural faults that continue to impede political progress – a defective constitution, censored media, and a partisan security and military establishment.	更别提继续阻碍政治进程的结构性缺陷了，包括有缺陷的宪法、受到严格审查的媒体以及党派的安全和军事力量了。
It didn’t have to be this way.	但是情况并非没有机会改变。
This past year has seen one missed opportunity after another.	过去的一年我们看到一个又一个的机会从我们的身边溜走了。
South African president Thabo Mbeki convened negotiations with Zimbabwe’s political groups; but they have been so unfruitful that opposition leaders recently all but accused Mbeki of lying to the world about the progress of the talks.	南非总统姆贝基召集津巴布韦的政治团体进行和谈，但是如此没有成果以致最近反对派领导人一致指责姆贝基在和谈进程的问题对世界撒了谎。
Some African leaders – notably Ghana’s president, John Kufuor, and outgoing African Union head Alpha Konare – have tried to cajole Mugabe towards reform, to no avail.	一些非洲领导人，主要的有加纳总统库福尔和现任非盟主席科纳雷试图劝说穆加贝进行改革，但是都无功而返。
Perhaps more significantly, the international community’s failure to address Zimbabwe seriously shows, once again, that it lacks the political will to prevent foreseeable crises.	也许更重要的是，国际社会没能站出来讨论如何处理津巴布韦的问题再一次严重地显示了它缺乏制止可预见的危机的政治意愿。
Last year, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour condemned the regime’s use of torture and its mistreatment of pro-democracy forces.	去年，联合国秘书长潘基文和联合国人权事务高级代表阿尔布尔严厉指责该国政府使用酷刑以及虐待民主力量。
Regrettably, the UN failed to follow up with institutional action.	令人遗憾的是联合国没有采取进一步的行动。
The UN would say it must be invited into a country before it can take certain forms of action, such as sending official election observers.	联合国也许会说它必须得到一个国家的邀请才能采取某种形式的行动，比如派遣官方选举观察员。
But it is also true that with adequate political will, the UN Security Council could live up to its responsibility to Zimbabweans by responding to the crisis more aggressively.	但是我们应该清楚，只要有足够的政治意愿，联合国安理会完全能够遵守它对津巴布韦人民的责任而对危机做出更为强有力的回应。
The UN should have put Mugabe on the defensive with a forceful public offer to help Zimbabwe prepare for internationally supervised elections.	联合国应该通过公开宣称愿意帮助津巴布韦准备一场受到国际监督的选举而迫使穆加贝采取守势。
Instead, the UN continues to defer to Mugabe, who hides behind claims of sovereignty while jailing a defenseless populace.	然而恰恰相反，联合国依然听任穆加贝为所欲为，他一面宣称主权不可侵犯，一面却在国内大肆拘捕手无寸铁的平民。
With so many lives at stake, what can be done to avert an intensification of the Zimbabwe crisis?	面对有这么多人的生命处于危险之中的状况，我们可以采取怎样的措施阻止津巴布韦的危机进一步恶化呢？
People of good will throughout the world, including those affiliated with multilateral organizations like the UN, should descend on Zimbabwe to observe this month’s elections.	全世界有良好意愿的人，包括那些在像联合国这样的多边组织工作的人，应该亲临津巴布韦观察这个月的大选。
Accredited or not, they should stand in solidarity with the people of Zimbabwe at this crucial moment, act as witnesses to the deteriorating pre-election environment, and serve as a bulwark against any escalation of state brutality during and after the vote.	不管有没有得到官方认可，他们都应该在这个关键时刻与津巴布韦的人民站在一起，作为不断恶化的选前环境的见证人，以及成为抵御投票期间和之后可能出现的任何国家暴力的升级的堡垒。
Mugabe would prefer to limit the presence of international observers to those sent by neighboring states – the same allies that somehow managed to deem the violent and fraudulent elections of the past seven years “legitimate.”	穆加贝肯定希望把国际观察员的存在限制在由他的那些邻国派遣的范围，那些邻国在过去七年那些充斥着暴力和欺骗性的选举说成是“合法的 ” 。
Zimbabwe’s neighbors also face a choice: they can use their proximity to halt Mugabe’s abuses, or to shield him from international scrutiny and rebuke.	津巴布韦的邻国同样面临着一个抉择：它们可以利用它们的邻国地位制止穆加贝滥用暴力，也可以保护他免受国际监督和指责。
Their choice may depend on what the world demands of them.	它们的选择也许取决于国际社会对他们提出怎样的要求。
The people of Zimbabwe will play their part on March 29.	津巴布韦人民在3月29日这一天做出他们的选择。
As for the regional and world community, their actions today and in the coming weeks could make the difference between a reprise of the violence in Kenya and the first step towards a more stable and democratic future.	对于地区和国际社会来说，它们今天以及在接下来数周的行动将决定这里是否会重复肯尼亚的暴乱，还是朝一个更稳定和民主的未来迈出第一步。
	
Zimbabwe’s Permanent Guantánamo	津巴布韦的永久性关塔纳摩
JOHANNESBURG – Last week, the United States Supreme Court ruled that detainees at Guantánamo Bay have the right to habeas corpus – the right to challenge the factual and legal basis of their detention in a court of law.	约翰内斯堡 - - 美国最高法院上周裁决，关塔纳摩湾的被拘押人员具有人身保护权，也就是他们有权在法院对其关押的事实和法律基础提出质疑。
I was elated by the decision, having spent four years working on ensuring the rule of law in US detention and interrogation policy, including monitoring military commission trials at Guantánamo Bay.	听到这一消息我兴奋不已。 我在过去四年时间里一直奔波，为的是确保美国的关押和审讯政策符合法治，包括监督关塔纳摩湾的军事审判。
But my happiness is tempered by where I sit, close to the border with Zimbabwe – a country where the writ of habeas corpus and the rule of law have become obsolete.	但是，我现在身处津巴布韦边境，兴奋大为减少，因为这一国家的人身保护法令和法治遭到了践踏。
Habeas corpus, Latin for “you have the body,” is an old English common law principle incorporated into the US Constitution to ensure freedom from unlawful detention by the state.	拉丁文中的“人身保护”是英国习惯法的一个古老原则。 美国宪法吸纳了这一原则来确保人身自由不受国家的非法压制。
It was and continues to be a critical check against the imprisonment of individuals without oversight by independent courts.	它曾经是对在没有独立法院监督下拘禁人身的一个重要制衡，而且也将继续如此。
In Zimbabwe, this right – like so many other checks and balances – has been torn away by a repressive state.	在津巴布韦，这一权利如同其他许多制衡机制一样已经被专制国家所撕毁。
Just hours before the US Supreme Court ruling, Tendai Biti, the Secretary-General of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), was arrested upon his return to Zimbabwe.	在美国最高法院做出裁决前几个小时，反对派民主变革运动秘书长彼迪在返回津巴布韦的时候被捕。
Despite immediate attempts by his lawyers to locate him, his whereabouts remained unknown for days.	尽管他的律师马上就开始寻找他，但是还是连续几天不知下落。
The police dismissed an initial court order demanding that Biti be produced before the court.	警方拒绝了法院最初要求把彼迪交付法院的命令。
After Biti was finally produced before the court days later, the government announced that he will be charged with treason – which carries the death penalty – for unofficially announcing the results of the March 29, 2008, elections. Prior to his detention, Biti had responded to such allegations by stating that his only crime was to fight for democracy in Zimbabwe.	几天后彼迪终于出现在法庭，政府宣布将指控他犯有可判处死刑的叛国罪行，原因是他私自宣布2008年3月29日的选举结果。 在他被拘禁以前，彼迪回应这些指控说，他唯一的罪行就是在津巴布韦争取民主。
It is unlikely that he will be able to challenge the basis of his detention in an independent court.	他不大可能会在独立法庭质疑对其实行拘押的理由。
Since 1999, the MDC has offered a democratic alternative to President Robert Mugabe’s regime.	从1999年以来，民主变革运动对穆加贝总统政权提出了民主性的代替选择。
In the most recent elections, Zimbabweans made their choice known, despite serious obstacles and widespread repression, with the MDC’s presidential candidate, Morgan Tsvangirai, gaining more votes than Mugabe.	在最近的选举中，津巴布韦人们表达了他们的选择。 尽管存在严重阻碍和大规模压制，民主变革运动的总统侯选人茨万吉拉伊获得的选票超过穆加贝。
But, according to the vote counts released by the government after a suspicious month-long delay, the MDC’s margin of victory – 48% to 43% – fell short of the 50% required to avoid a run-off election.	但是，在经过一个月令人怀疑的耽搁后，政府公布投票结果，民主变革运动获得48%对43%的胜利，低于规定的50 % ， 从而必须进行再次投票。
Biti is not the only MDC member to be “disappeared” for a period of time by Mugabe’s government.	彼迪并不是唯一在穆加贝政府统治时期“消失”的民主变革运动成员。
Over the past two years, police and government-supported paramilitaries have routinely jailed, beaten, and even killed MDC officials and suspected MDC members.	在过去两年的时间里，警察和政府支持的准军事部队时常拘押、殴打甚至杀害民主变革运动官员以及被怀疑是该运动的成员。
Last year, Biti was detained and beaten along with Tsvangirai and dozens of other MDC officials.	去年，彼迪和茨万吉拉伊以及其他十几个民主变革运动官员一同被拘押和遭到殴打。
The photos of Tsvangirai’s pummeled body led to an international outcry.	茨万吉拉伊遭到殴打的照片引发了国际社会的强烈抗议。
State-sponsored violence against the MDC and its supporters has escalated as the June 27 run-off vote draws near.	随着6月27日再次投票的临近，针对民主变革运动及其支持者的由国家支持的暴力行为升级了。
Just weeks ago, Biti described the discovery of the mutilated body of Tonderai Ndira, an MDC youth leader.	仅仅在几个星期以前，彼迪讲述发现了民主变革运动青年领导人尼拉被肢解的尸体。
Ndira had been taken by the police from his home.	尼拉在家中被警察带走。 他失踪七天。
He was missing for seven days; when his body was found, it was recognizable only by a bracelet he always wore.	当他的尸体被发现的时候，人们只能从他总是戴着的手镯辨认出来。
Here in our offices in Johannesburg, we have two Zimbabwean lawyers who fled their country after receiving death threats for their work defending human rights.	在我们位于约翰内斯堡的办事处里有两位津巴布韦律师。 他们由于维护人权的工作而收到了死亡威胁，逃离了他们的国家。
At least five of their clients have been murdered in the past few weeks.	至少有五名他们的客户在过去两周内被谋杀。
Most recently, the Zimbabwean police suspended the work of numerous human rights organizations that were documenting the recent violence.	最近，津巴布韦警察中止了众多记录最近暴力事件的人权组织的工作。
It is hard to imagine that a free and fair election can take place against the backdrop of such intense and systemic violence.	很难想像在这样一种紧张而又系统化的暴力背景下可以举行自由公正的选举。
Indeed, even South African president Thabo Mbeki, who, despite an outcry from many of his citizens, has supported Mugabe, felt compelled to label it a “cause for serious concern.”	南非总统姆贝基过去不顾其人民的强烈反对支持穆加贝。 实际上连他也感到不得不把这一事态称为“令人严重关切 ” 。
In the majority opinion in Boumediene v. Bush , Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote that “Liberty and security can be reconciled; and in our system they are reconciled within the framework of the law.”	美国最高法院法官肯尼迪在其布梅迪艾内诉布什一案中的多数意见中写到 ： “ 自由和安全可以两全；在美国的体制中这二者在法律的框架内得以两全 ” 。
But there is no rule of law left in Zimbabwe – no habeas corpus and no check on arbitrary state action.	但是津巴布韦已经没有了法治，没有了人身保护，也没有了对专制国家行为的制衡。
It is time for the international community to step in, call for an end to the detention and disappearance of MDC officials and perceived supporters, and push for a democratic transition in Zimbabwe.	现在国际社会应该干预，呼吁结束拘押民主变革运动官员及其支持者及其消亡，并且推动津巴布韦的民主转型。
Only then can the principles underlying the Supreme Court’s decision come within reach of ordinary Zimbabweans.	只有这样，普通津巴布韦人民才会享有最高法院决定中的原则基础。
	
Zoellick to the Rescue?	佐利克能否力挽狂澜？
Will newly anointed World Bank President Robert Zoellick be able to get the organization back on its feet after the catastrophic failed presidency of Paul Wolfowitz?	沃尔福威茨铩羽而归，刚刚获得任命的行长佐利克能否收拾世界银行的残局？
Although hardly a megawatt star of the Bob Rubin category, he certainly brings some positive attributes to the job.	尽管佐利克无法与明星级的鲁宾相提并论，但是他肯定给这一职位带来了某些积极的特点。
First, as a key player in bringing China into the World Trade Organization, Zoellick is a proven internationalist in an American administration where internationalists have sometimes seemed like an endangered species.	首先，佐利克是将中国带入世界贸易组织的关键人物。 在布什政府中，国际主义者有时候看起来像是濒危物种，而佐利克就是一位确定无疑的国际主义者。
Second, he is a firm believer in the power of markets and free trade, which have clearly done far more to alleviate poverty over the past half-century than any aid program.	第二，他坚信市场和自由贸易的力量，而这两者在过去本个世纪中在减轻贫困上发挥的作用明显要比任何援助项目都大。
Third, he seems to have been a consistent behind-the-scenes supporter of the Bank, whereas many of his Bush administration colleagues would be just as happy to see it shut down and its Washington headquarters turned into private condominiums and offices.	第三，他看起来好像是世界银行一贯的幕后支持者，而他的布什政府中的许多同僚巴不得把世界银行关闭，把银行的华盛顿总部改造成私人公寓和办公室。
So presumably he has a constructive vision for the Bank’s future.	所以他理应对银行的未来具有建设性的远见。
But Zoellick is not without his weaknesses.	但是佐利克也并非完人。
First and foremost, his appointment extends the embarrassingly outmoded practice of always installing an American in the job.	最为重要的是，这一任命延续了总是把一个美国人安插在这一位置上的令人难堪的过时做法。
With the Bank tirelessly preaching the merits of good governance, its failure to adopt democratic principles undercuts its own legitimacy.	尽管世界银行不知疲倦地宣扬良好管理价值，但是它不采纳民主原则却破坏了它自身的合法性。
The claim that the World Bank needs an American president to ensure that the US keeps donating money is ridiculous.	那种宣称世界银行需要一个美国人担任行长来确保美国继续捐款的说法是荒谬的。
The annual cost of the US contribution to the World Bank, even taking into account off-the-books loan guarantees, is relatively minor.	美国给世界银行的年度捐款即使加上不在册的贷款保证也是相对少的。
Any number of developing countries, from China to India to Brazil, could easily step up if the US foolishly stepped down.	如果美国愚蠢地退出，从中国、印度到巴西的任何发展中国家都可以轻松地增加拨款。
Zoellick’s background as a lawyer hardly makes him perfect for the job, either.	而且，佐利克的律师背景也很难让他成为完美的人选。
The World Bank presidency is not about negotiating treaties, as Zoellick did when he was US Trade Representative.	世界银行行长并不是像佐利克担任美国贸易代表那样谈判条约。
The Bank’s most important role in development today is as a “knowledge bank” that helps aggregate, distill, and disseminate best practices from around the world.	世行在当今发展中最为重要的作用是作为一个“知识银行”帮助在全世界增加、提炼和传播最佳实务。
In this respect, the Bank’s technical assistance to governments is very similar to what private consultants offer to companies.	在这一方面，世行给各国政府的技术援助与私人顾问提供给公司的很相像。
Moreover, many of the World Bank president’s most important decisions involve economics in an essential way.	而且，世行行长许多最为重要的决定在很大程度上都是与经济学有关。
Wrong economic decisions, such as in the 1970’s, when Robert McNamara pushed grandiose, but environmentally devastating, infrastructure projects, have haunted the Bank for decades.	在七十年代，麦克拉马拉推动了许多规模宏大但造成环境灾难的基础设施项目。 这样的错误经济决定几十年来一直困扰着世行。
The biggest question mark, though, is whether Zoellick will be able to hit the ground running and implement desperately needed reforms.	但是，最大的问题是佐利克能否旗开得胜并落实急需的改革措施。
Reform number one, of course, is to ensure that the next World Bank President is not an American.	首要改革当然就是要确保下一个世界银行行长不是美国人。
Rodrigo de Rato, Zoellick’s counterpart at the European-dominated International Monetary Fund, has already suggested that his successor should be chosen in a more inclusive process.	由欧洲人掌控的国际货币基金组织总裁、也是佐利克的对手拉托已经表明他的继任人应当从更为包容的进程中挑选。
The World Bank should be ashamed that its president has not yet offered a similar proposal.	世界银行行长如果还没有提出一个类似的提议，那么世行就应该感到羞愧。
Second, Zoellick should ask why the Bank spends only 2.5% of its budget on the “knowledge bank” research function that it trumpets so proudly in its external relations materials, while it spends three times that amount on maintaining its executive board.	第二，佐利克应当问一下，为什么世行在其对外宣传资料中大肆宣扬的“知识银行”研究功能只有2.5％的预算，而维持其执行委员会的数量却是它的三倍。
Third, Zoellick should use his formidable negotiating skills to cajole rich countries into greatly increasing the grant component of World Bank aid.	第三，佐利克应当运用他娴熟的谈判技巧来劝说富国大幅度增加世行援助的赠款部分。
The idea that a big government-guaranteed global bank is needed to fill holes in private capital markets is laughable nowadays.	需要由一个庞大的、由政府担保的全球性银行来填补私人资本市场的漏洞这一想法在今天看来是可笑的。
True, the Bank’s poorest clients have little access to private capital markets.	的确，世行最穷的客户们基本上无法得到私人资本市场的资金。
By and large, however, the poorest countries need grants, not loans that they still won’t be able to pay in 20 years.	但是，总体而言，最穷的国家需要的是赠款，而不是它们所无法在20年中偿还的贷款。
As the Bank switches from loans to grants, it can use some of its massive retained earnings to endow its “knowledge bank” function and related technical advice.	在世行从贷款转为赠款的时候，它可以使用其巨大的保留收益来为其“知识银行”功能和相关的技术建议提供资金。
But all this knowledge shouldn’t be free.	但是所有的这些建议都不应当是免费的。
A lot of technical advice falls on deaf ears, with countries listening only long enough to get their hands on Bank money.	许多技术建议被置若罔闻，许多国家为了获得世行的款项才洗耳恭听。
Instead of merely pushing its agenda, the Bank should start charging for its technical advice on a graduated scale so that more of its engagements are client-driven.	世行不能仅仅推动它的议程，而是应该开始对它的技术建议按照渐进标准收取费用，这样，它的更多的项目才会是以客户为导向的。
Last but not least, the Bank needs to play a much bigger role in environmental issues and, in general, in promoting good international citizenship by both rich and poor countries.	最后一点但不是最次要的一点就是，世行需要在环境问题和在总体上来说在穷国和富国中促进良好的国际公民项目上发挥更大的作用。
(Some of us have been proposing this for almost two decades.)	（我们有些人已经提议几乎二十年了。 ）
Of course, Zoellick could just attempt to fill the role symbolically and do little or nothing, as some of his predecessors have done.	当然，佐利克可以像他的许多前任那样做表面文章或者干脆无所作为。
Or, less likely, he could embrace some megalomaniacal and over-reaching vision of government intervention, as others have tried.	或者，他也可以像其他人那样采取某些狂妄自大而又过度庞大的政府干预规划。
In any case, let’s wish him luck.	无论如何，让我们祝他好运。
The world needs the World Bank a lot more than it needs another condominium.	世界需要世界银行，远远要超过世界银行需要另一个公寓。
	
Zuma Rising	祖马胜出
The anxiety over Jacob Zuma’s election as president of South Africa obscures a significant milestone: for the first time in decades, a sub-Saharan nation has at its helm a champion of ordinary people.	有些人对祖马当选南非总统的担忧，使一个重要的具有里程碑式意义的事件 — — 几十年来的第一次，一个撒哈拉以南非洲国家将会由一个支持平民大众的人当领导人 — — 蒙上了阴影。
African politics has long been the exclusive domain of aristocrats, soldiers, and technocrats.	非洲政治长期以来都是贵族、军人和专家政治家的专属领域。
Even with the spread of democratic elections, the region’s leaders tend to come from the ranks of soldiers (Uganda, Rwanda, Zimbabwe), family dynasties (Togo, Kenya, etc), or university professors, lawyers, and economists (Ghana, Malawi, Liberia).	即使随着民主选举的发展，撒哈拉以南非洲国家的领导人一般也都是军人（例如乌干达、卢旺达和津巴布韦的领导人 ） ， 家族王朝（例如多哥、肯尼亚等国的领导人 ） ， 或者大学教授、律师和经济学家（例如加纳、马拉维、利比里亚的领导人）出身。
Now South Africa, the region’s economic engine and home to its most sophisticated universities, media, and corporations, has a former goat herder at its helm, a rare African leader with the common touch.	现在，作为撒哈拉以南非洲国家经济引擎和最先进的大学、媒体以及公司所在地的南非，拥有了一位曾经当过牧羊人的领导人 — — 一位罕见的具有平易近人品质的非洲领导人。
Zuma is legendary for his ability to connect with ordinary people.	
He’s secure enough to dance and sing in public. He speaks the language of populism, raising hopes for the vast majority of South Africans who daily endure the misery of poor housing, schools, and health care.	祖马在和普通民众打成一片方面具有超凡的能力，他在公开场合唱歌跳舞都很轻松自如，他用普通大众的语言进行演说，他为广大每天忍受恶劣的居住、教育和医疗条件的南非人带来了希望。
In contrast to his two predecessors – the saintly Nelson Mandela, who emphasized racial healing, and the aristocratic Thabo Mbeki, who reassured financiers with his strong grasp of macroeconomics – Zuma recognizes the pent-up demand for material improvement in the lives of his country’s tens of millions of have-nots.	祖马和他的两位前任 — — 强调种族愈合的品德高尚的尼尔森·曼德拉和通过对宏观经济强有力的把握打消金融家顾虑的贵族化的塔博·姆贝基 — — 不同，他认识到了南非几千万穷人被抑制的改善物质生活条件的需求。
“We have learned from the mistakes of the past 15 years, especially the manner of which we may have, to some degree, neglected the people’s movement,” he said in April, before his African National Congress swept to victory.	“我们已经从过去15年的错误中，特别是从在某种程度上忽略了人民运动的错误中，吸取了教训 。 ” 他在四月份于非洲国民大会党横扫对手取得胜利之前，如是说。
Until now, populism has been the missing note in African political culture.	直到现在，非洲政治文化中仍然缺乏平民主义的观念。
Zuma, who spent his youth herding cattle and only gained formal education while in the notorious Robben Island prison with Mandela, is refreshingly aware that Africa’s biggest problem is its inequalities, not its global marginalization.	祖马的青年时代是在放牧中度过的，他直到和曼德拉一起被关押在了臭名昭著的罗宾岛（Robben Island）监狱之后，才接受正式的教育的；祖马清醒地认识到，非洲最大的问题是不平等问题，而不是在世界上被边缘化了的问题。
In Africa’s wealthiest nation – but also the nation where wealth is most unequally shared – a bold populist now holds ultimate power over government policy.	在非洲最富裕的国家，但是也是财富分配最不公平的国家 — — 南非，一个大胆的平民主义者现在对政府政策拥有了最终决策的权力了。
Yet, while Zuma’s populist appeal reflects South Africa’s especially large differences in economic class, the threat of imposing higher taxes and other obligations on employers and the wealthy has raised fears at home and internationally.	然而，虽然祖马的平民主义吸引力反映了南非特别巨大的经济阶层差异，但是，他扬言要对雇主和富人征收更高的税赋和施加其他的义务，已经在南非国内外引起了人们的担心。
Moreover, Zuma has been called a chameleon, accused of telling his audiences what they want to hear.	而且，还有人将祖马称为变色龙，指责他总是向听众讲他们想听的东西。
Zuma’s turbulent personal life – many wives and his embarrassing contention during a rape trial that he avoided HIV infection by taking a shower – has invited ridicule.	祖马混乱的私生活 — — 他有多位妻子，以及他在一起强奸审判中说他通过淋浴避免艾滋病病毒的令人尴尬的辩解 — — 已经引起了一些人的嘲笑。
Most seriously, doubts persist about his commitment to democracy, with critics arguing he’s an old-style African “big man” ready to bully opponents and ravage the public coffers with his cronies.	更严重的是，有人对他的民主承诺一直持怀疑态度，也有批评家批评他是一个老式的非洲“专制人物 ” ， 认为他会威吓对手并与其亲信一起侵占公共财产。
Dismissing complaints, Zuma insists, “There’s no cloud around me.”	为了驳斥这些批评，祖马坚称 ， “ 我是光明正大的 。 ”
His defenders, meanwhile, point to two benefits that he has already delivered: an end to Mbeki’s ambivalent approach to fighting HIV/AIDS, the country’s major public health threat, and a refreshing willingness to move against Zimbabwe’s aged dictator, Robert Mugabe, whom Mbeki coddled out of a misguided sense of loyalty for his support during the struggle against apartheid.	同时，他的支持者也向人们指出了两个他已经承诺过的好处：结束姆贝基对抗南非主要的公共健康威胁 — — 艾滋病病毒/艾滋病 — — 的充满矛盾的做法，用行动反对津巴布韦年迈的独裁者罗伯特·穆加贝的全新观点 — — 对于罗伯特·穆加贝，姆贝基因为其在南非反对种族隔离制度时期给予反种族隔离制度人士的支持而对其产生了具有误导性的信任，因而纵容他的独裁统治。
In an Africa bereft of successful populist politicians, Zuma’s role models may come from Latin America, where income inequality is also extreme and the trade-union movement, as in South Africa, is strong and militant.	在缺乏成功的平民主义政治家的非洲，祖马的行为榜样可能来源于拉丁美洲。 在拉丁美洲，收入不平等问题也是极端严重的，而且，工会运动和南非一样，非常强大而好战。
With enormous pressure from ordinary people to deliver tangible gains, Zuma the populist will quickly face a major test: will he emulate Lula of Brazil, who has struck an admirable balance between good economic governance and re-distribution of wealth to the poor?	因为来自普通民众要求给予切实好处的巨大压力，平民主义者祖马很快就会面临一个重大考验：他是效仿巴西的卢拉，在良好的经济治理和将财富重新分配给穷人间取得令人钦佩的平衡呢？
Or will he follow the path of Hugo Chávez, a popular autocrat who seems to prefer building a cult of personality over raising living standards for the poor.	还是会走上一条雨果·查韦斯式的道路，做一个受欢迎的独裁者，和提高穷人的生活水平相比，更愿意建立起个人崇拜呢？
The stakes for Africa are enormous.	这对非洲厉害攸关。
South Africa has the continent’s largest economy and, until the global financial crisis, posted 10 years of steady economic growth.	南非是非洲最大的经济体，并且，在经济危机爆发之前的十年里，经济稳定增长。
In an economic slowdown, the country’s severe crime problem might only worsen; so might unemployment, which already tops 20% in the formal economy.	在经济低迷时期，南非严重的犯罪问题肯定会恶化；而且，已经在正式经济体中占前20%的失业问题，也会恶化。
Zuma senses the urgency of the situation.	祖马意识到了问题的紧迫性。
He is, after all, 67 years old and likely to serve only a single term in office.	毕竟，他已经67岁了，不大可能会连任。
“We can’t waste time,” he says.	他说 ， “ 我们不能浪费时间 。 ”
Yet, according to the political economist Moeletsi Mbeki, at his core, “Zuma is a conservative.”	然而，根据政治经济学家莫莱茨·姆贝基(Moeletsi Mbeki)的观点，在本质上 ， “ 祖马是一个保守主义者 。 ”
In this sense, Zuma represents yesterday’s South Africa.	在这个意义上，祖马代表的是过去的南非。
He is part of the proud generation that defeated apartheid – and then peacefully engineered a transition to durable black-majority rule.	他是打败种族隔离制度 — — 然后让南非和平过渡到由人口占多数的黑人进行长期统治 — — 的自豪的一代人的一部分。
Their achievement remains one of the greatest in recent history.	这一代人的成就是现代��史上最伟大的成就之一。
At the same time, Zuma’s revolutionary generation still seems uneasy leading South Africa in a post-apartheid era that is now 15 years old.	同时，祖马革命的一代似乎对领导打破种族隔离制度15年后的南非，还不适应。
In a region that reveres the elderly, Zuma’s attachment to his rural traditions must be matched by an equal openness to the appetites of the country’s youth.	在一个尊敬老人的地区，祖马对其乡下传统的依恋，必须和对南非年青人的爱好所持的平等而开放态度相平衡。
Three in ten South Africans are younger than 15, meaning that they did not live a day under apartheid.	在南非，每10个人中就有三个人的年龄小于15岁，这意味着，这些人从来没有在种族隔离制度下生活过。
Somehow Zuma must find a way to honor his own generation’s commitment to racial justice and national liberation, while empowering the masses who daily suffer the sting of class differences and yearn for material gain.	在某种程度上，祖马在给予那些心灵每天都会被阶层差异刺痛以及渴望物质利益的广大民众权利的同时，他还必须找到一个实践自己那一代人所作的种族公正和民族解放承诺的途径
